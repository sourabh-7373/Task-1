We propose a fast non-iterative approximate inference method that uses a feedforward network to implement efficient exact sampling from the variational posterior. The model and this inference network are trained jointly by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Although the naive estimator of the inference network gradient is too high-variance to be useful, we make it practical by applying several straightforward model-independent variance reduction techniques. Applying our approach to training sigmoid belief networks and deep autoregressive networks, we show that it outperforms the wake-sleep algorithm on MNIST and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Reuters RCV1 document dataset.","venue":"International Conference on Machine Learning","year":2014,"referenceCount":34,"citationCount":707,"influentialCitationCount":91,"isOpenAccess":false,"openAccessPdf":null,"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Mathematics"],"s2FieldsOfStudy":[{"category":"Computer Science","source":"external"},{"category":"Mathematics","source":"external"},{"category":"Computer Science","source":"s2-fos-model"}],"publicationTypes":["JournalArticle","Conference"],"publicationDate":"2014-01-31","journal":{"pages":"1791-1799"},"authors":[{"authorId":"1714004","name":"A.
