      "title": "Dystopian or Utopian? Two Images of Alan Turing", "abstract": "Turing
      made intriguing statements about the future of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI)
      in society. He predicted that machines would eventually \u2018compete with men
      in all purely intellectual \ufb01elds,\u2019 and added that at some stage they
      could be expected \u2018to take control.\u2019 Turing has been associated by
      his biographer, Andrew Hodges, with Dr. Frankenstein from Mary Shelley\u2019s
      dystopian novel. However, he has also been described by his contemporary Geoffrey
      Jefferson as a \u2018scienti\ufb01c\u2019 Percy B. Shelley, the English Romantic
      poet who was posthumously championed as a utopian and radical thinker. This
      article then asks: in what way did Turing envision a society permeated with
      intelligent machines? Did he see it as a utopia or a dystopia? These questions
      are thoroughly examined using Turing\u2019s own texts and related sources. This
      study reconstructs Turing\u2019s historical context in postwar England and analyzes
      his irony and sense of humor, as well as the in\ufb02uence of Samuel Butler
      on his vision. Contrary to recent views in AI science and \ufb01ction, on the
      one hand, a mismatch is shown between Turing and the incautious Frankenstein;
      on the other hand, Turing\u2019s radical Shelley-like qualities are substantiated.
      The article shows that Turing\u2019s utopianism entrusted intelligent machines
      with the task of teaching lessons of rationality and intellectual integrity
      over our place in nature and prejudices. Further, Turing\u2019s irony is shown
      to have targeted intellectuals who sacri\ufb01ce independent thinking to retain
      their power. These, he hoped, would be eventually rivaled and surpassed by intelligent
      machines.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount":

      "2012 was the Alan Turing Year \u2014 the celebration of the 100th anniversary
      of Alan Turing\u2019s birth. Turing\u2019s biographer Andrew Hodges in the \u201cForward\u201d
      to The Turing Guide comments that \u201cTuring\u2019s centenary year reflected
      a general public sense that the issues of Alan Turing\u2019s life and work are
      as relevant as ever in the twentyfirst century.\u201d The Turing Guide consists
      of 42 essays that are written for general readers and that celebrate Turing\u2019s:
      life (38 pages), accomplishments in mathematics (44 pages), codebreaking (120
      pages), On Computable Numbers and the Turing machine (36 pages), postwar work
      on computers (67 pages), contributions to morphogenesis (32 pages), ideas related
      to machine intelligence (86 pages), and legacy (32 pages). Eleven essays deal
      directly with codebreaking. Copeland either wrote, participated in the writing
      of, or revised 16 of the essays. Of the eight essays in the section \u201cArtificial
      Intelligence and the Mind,\u201d three were written by Diane Proudfoot and one
      includes her as a coauthor with Copeland (who wrote one other essay and coauthored
      a third essay in that section). The book begins with an overview of Turing\u2019s
      life and work by Copeland and Bowen. The essay is mostly a timeline of Turing\u2019s
      life. The authors suggest that Turing\u2019s death might have been accidental.
      Chapter 3, \u201cMeeting a Genius\u201d (4 pages), is by mathematician and Bletchley
      Park codebreaker Peter Hilton (1923\u20132010). Notes to the chapter (p. 485)
      state that the chapter was \u201cassembled by Jack Copeland\u201d and \u201cpublished
      with the permission of [Hilton\u2019s] wife.\u201d It is also noted that \u201c[in]
      2001 and again in 2002 [Hilton] visited Copeland at the University of Canterbury
      in New Zealand, where he delivered lectures on Turing and codebreaking. [The]
      chapter is a compilation of extracts from [Hilton\u2019s] papers and notes left
      in New Zealand, together with extracts from [Hilton\u2019s]", "venue": "Cryptologia",

      network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this
      paper. The network is self-organized by \"learning without a teacher\", and
      acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical
      similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This
      network is given a nickname \"neocognitron\". After completion of self-organization,
      the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous
      system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer
      (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular
      structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a
      cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \"S-cells'', which show
      characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and
      the second layer consists of \"C-cells\" similar to complex cells or higher
      order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity
      and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We
      do not need any \"teacher\" during the process of selforganization, and it is
      only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer
      of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After
      repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern
      has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer,
      and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus
      pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than
      one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected
      by the pattern''s position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change
      in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount":

      "title": "Five 1951 BBC Broadcasts on Automatic Calculating Machines", "abstract":
      "Researchers of Britain\u2019s early postwar history of computing have known
      for some time that a series of five British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio
      broadcasts under the general title of \u201cAutomatic Calculating Machines\u201d
      was broadcast on the BBC\u2019s Third Programme radio service in May\u2013June
      1951. In these broadcasts, five British pioneers of computing spoke about their
      work. In the order of their broadcasts, they were Douglas Hartree, Max Newman,
      Alan Turing, Frederic (\u201cFreddie\u201d) Williams, and Maurice Wilkes. Apart
      from Turing\u2019s broadcast, which has been discussed by B. Jack Copeland1
      and Andrew Hodges,2 these broadcasts have received little attention from historians
      of computing. No sound recordings of the broadcasts survive, although they all
      were recorded on acetate phonograph discs prior to transmission. However, texts
      of all five broadcasts survive as BBC transcripts, which were taken from the
      recordings shortly after they were made. These transcripts are held at the BBC\u2019s
      Written Archives Centre in Caversham, near Reading, and are the basis for this
      article. In addition to the existence of the five BBC transcripts, three of
      the speakers\u2019 scripts are known to have survived. These are Turing\u2019s,
      held at the Alan Turing archive at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, and those
      of Wilkes and Newman, copies of which are held by Wilkes. Turing\u2019s script
      has been published,3 although curiously not in the Collected Works of A.M. Turing,4
      and is also available on the Word Wide Web.5 None of the other scripts has been
      published. All five of the speakers in this series were, or had been, involved
      with one or more of the three major computing projects in the UK in the immediate
      postwar period: \u2022 ACE (Automatic Computing Engine), at the National Physical
      Laboratory, designed by Turing, launched in 1946 and experimentally operational
      in a pilot version in 1950, although not completed until late 1951.6 \u2022
      EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Computer), at Cambridge University,
      designed by Wilkes, begun in 1947 and operational in May 1949.7 \u2022 Mark
      1 Prototype at Manchester University, associated with Newman, Williams, and
      (from 1948) Turing. Operational from April 1949 to August 1950, having evolved
      from an earlier \u201cBaby\u201d test machine (operational June 1948) and replaced
      in February 1951 by the Ferranti Mark 1.8", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount":

      deened set of rules and a speciic goal. Developing a program to play a strategic
      game well often involves the application of theoretical concepts to practical
      situations, and the relative success of that endeavour can be measured with
      quantiiable results. The game of poker is logistically simple yet strategically
      complex, and ooers many properties not exhibited by chess, checkers, and most
      other well-studied games. Most importantly, poker is a non-deterministic game
      with imperfect (hidden) information. Handling unreliable or incomplete information
      is a fundamental problem in computer science, and poker provides an excellent
      domain for investigating problems of decision making under conditions of uncertainty.
      Somewhat surprisingly, the potential beneets of studying poker have been largely
      overlooked by computer scientists and game researchers. In this essay we survey
      what resources are available for academic researchers, and lay some foundations
      for the sci-entiic exploration of this fascinating game.", "venue": "", "year":

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence : Usfssg Computers to Think about Thinking
      . Part 1", "abstract": "In 1950, Alan M. Turing, the late deputy director of
      the University of Manchester\u2019s Computing Laboratory in England, proposed
      a novel test to determine whether a machine was capable of thinking. In thk
      test, an interrogator has a teletype conversation with a man and a woman, both
      of whom must try to convince the interrogator that they are the woman. At some
      point unknown to the interrogator, the man is replaced by a machine. If the
      interrogator is fooled as often by the machine as by the man, that machine can
      be said to have displayed intelligent behavior. 1 Some 30 years after Turing
      proposed this test, many aspects of human behavior have been simulated by a
      computer. Programs have been designed to play checkersz and chess,J prove mathematical
      theorems ,4,5 and even mimic the behavior of a paranoid human being.b Despite
      the success of these and many other programs, none of the researchers investigating
      what\u2019s been variously cafled \u201capplied epistemology\u201d or \u201cartificial
      intelligence\u201d (AI) would claim this means the \u201cthinking machine\u201d
      has arrived. Instead, they would agree that these programs have contributed
      important information about human behavior, and how computers can simulate it.
      The first part of this two-part essay will review some of the theones AI researchers
      have developed to explain human \u201cinformation processing.\u201d The second
      part of the essay will cover some applications of AI research. These include
      programs used in robotics, programs that communicate with computer users in
      natural languages such as English, and \u201cexpert systems\u201d which help
      chemists, physicians, and others perform decision-making tasks. The \u201cpioneer\u201d
      expert system, DENDRAL, will be discussed in some detail.T.~ AI grew out of
      the convergence of ideas in several different fields, and the availability of
      new technologies. According to Avrom Barr and Edward A. Feigenbaum, Stanford
      University, California, the single most important factor contributing to the
      birth of the field was the invention of the computer.9 They point out that human
      beings have always drawn analogies between mechanical devices and their own
      behavior. Computers, with their memories and information-processing abilities,
      naturafly invited analogies with the human brain. Shortly after digital computers
      became available, computer scientists began creating programs that, they hoped,
      would perform tasks generally considered to require intelligence. Their earliest
      efforts were directed at programming computers to solve puzzles, play games
      such as chess, backgammon, and checkers, solve mathematical theorems, and translate
      text from one language to another. The early computer programs performed these
      tasks, but not very well. For example, chess programs were successful at following
      the step-by-step instructions for moving chessmen. But computers couldn\u2019t

      note is concerned with the logical formalism with types recently introduced

      characterisation of the Church type-stratification given by one of us, it is
      desirable to have the remaining cases cleared up. A formal proof of Y\u03b1
      is now given for all types \u03b1 containing \u03b9, but the proof uses, in

      possibly shorter. The present note has been written in the belief that Church''s
      formulation of the simple theory of types is particularly suitable as a basis
      for work on that theory, and that it is therefore worth while introducing special
      conventions which take into account the needs of this particular system. The
      conventions which I shall describe are ones which I have used a good deal myself,
      and have always found adequate. I intend to make use of them in forthcoming
      papers. They may be regarded as an extension of Curry''s conventions. I shall
      begin with a general discussion of punctuation by means of groups of dots. This

      of positive integers. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the computable
      functions introduced by the author are identical with the \u03bb-definable functions
      of Church and the general recursive functions due to Herbrand and G\u00f6del
      and developed by Kleene. It is shown that every \u03bb-definable function is
      computable and that every computable function is general recursive. There is
      a modified form of \u03bb-definability, known as \u03bb-K-definability, and
      it turns out to be natural to put the proof that every \u03bb-definable function
      is computable in the form of a proof that every \u03bb-K-definable function
      is computable; that every \u03bb-definable function is \u03bb-K-definable is
      trivial. If these results are taken in conjunction with an already available
      proof that every general recursive function is \u03bb-definable we shall have
      the required equivalence of computability with \u03bb-definability and incidentally
      a new proof of the equivalence of \u03bb-definability and \u03bb-K-definability.

      in a short space. I therefore refer the reader to Computable pp. 230\u2013235

      see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.
      Year 2012 is both the centenary of Alan Turing''s birth and the 60th anniversary
      of the famous paper The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, in which he established
      foundations of the mathematical theory of biological and chemical pattern formation.
      The story started much earlier, in spring 1923, as documented by his mother
      in a caricature entitled Hockey or Watching the Daisies Grow. Crucial motif
      in the drawing is that, while most players are engaged by the game, Alan is
      investigating a flower emerging just off the field. Always fascinated by the
      relationship between matter and spirit, especially in the processes of thinking
      , Turing started from the assumption that the operation of human brain is completely
      physical. This led him to invention of an abstract computing machine named after
      him, which laid the foundations of modern computer science. In recognition of
      his enormous contribution to the growth of the field, the most prestigious award
      in computer science, called \" Nobel Prize of computing \" , is named after
      Turing. Success has many fathers, but it was Alan Turing to whom we owe the
      final breaking of the Enigma code. He extended the idea of so-called \" Cryptology
      bombs \" , i.e., machines aimed at breaking codes, constructed before World
      War II by Polish mathematicians: Rejewski, R\u00f3\u02d9 zycki and Zygalski.
      His solution ensured the information advantage of the Allies during the Battle
      of the Atlantic, which had a direct bearing on the success of operations in
      Normandy and the defeat of Nazi Germany. After the war, Turing took up marathon
      running to relieve the stress, studied why spots on the leop-ard''s body are
      in the shape of a rosette or ring, and proposed a test to measure the machine''s
      ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. For this last reason, Turing is regarded
      as a founder of artificial intelligence. He left this world prematurely in the
      age of 42, but managed to finish the race with the highest score, in fact more
      than one race.. . In this special issue, we present a selection of papers commemorating
      Alan Turing and arguing that he should be also considered the co-founder of
      biomathematics and bioinformatics. His late works were", "venue": "", "year":

      "I propose to consider the question, \"Can machines think?\" This should begin
      with definitions of the meaning of the terms \"machine\" and \"think.\" The
      definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use
      of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words \"machine\"
      and \"think\" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is
      difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question,
      \"Can machines think?\" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup
      poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace
      the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in
      relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the problem can be described in
      terms of a game which we call the \"imitation game.\" It is played with three
      people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either
      sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart'' from the other two. The object
      of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the
      man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end
      of the game he says either \"X is A and Y is B\" or \"X is Band Y is A.\" The
      interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: C: Will X please tell
      me the length of his or her hair? Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer.
      It is A''s object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification.
      His answer might therefore be: \"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands
      are about nine inches long. \" 11", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount":
