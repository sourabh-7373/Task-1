      to an end, without losing the possibility of finishing them off properly later
      on. We intend to describe the principles of a program structure for which these
      two objections no longer hold. In the first place we sought a means of removing
      the second restriction, for this essentially restricts the admissable structure
      of the program; hence the name \u201cRecursive Programming\u201d. More efficient
      use of the memory as regards the internal working spaces of subroutines is a
      secondary con\u00ad sequence not without significance. The solution can be applied
      under perfectly general conditions, e.g. in the structure of an object program
      to be delivered by an ALGOL 60 compiler. The fact that the proposed methods
      tend to be rather time consuming on an average present day computer, may give
      a hint in which direction future design might go. Recursive Programming", "venue":

      "title": "Go To Statement Considered Harmful", "abstract": "To many people,
      Dijkstra''s letter to the Editor of Communications of the A CM, published in
      March 1968, marks the true beginning of structured programming. That it influenced
      the industry is clear, if for no other reason than for the articles it spawned,
      ranging from \"IF-THEN-ELSE Considered Harmful,\" to \"The Else Must Go, Too,\"
      to \"Programming Considered Harmful.\" \n \nIn form and content, Dijkstra''s
      letter is similar to his 1965 paper, which appears first in this collection.
      Description of the inverse relationship between a programmer''s ability and
      the density of goto statements in his program is repeated, as is the emphasis
      on the limited ability of the human brain. Much of the discussion is somewhat
      theoretical in nature, and the typical COBOL programmer will hunger for some
      coding examples so that he can see why goto statements make program logic harder
      to understand. \n \nEchoing his 1965 paper, the last few paragraphs underscore
      once again why the subject of structured programming stayed out of the mainstream
      of the data processing industry for so long. As Dijkstra points out, goto statements
      were a subject of discussion among academicians as far back as 1959. But even
      today, people whom Dijkstra acknowledges --- names like Wirth, Hoare, Strachey,
      and Landin --- are not well known to business-oriented or scientificoriented
      programmers, so it should be no surprise that their ideas have languished for

      "Programming languages are not uniformly perceived by the software engineering
      community: some are respected, others are hated, some have a devoted following,
      others are viewed as a necessary evil. However, is it true that using some languages
      on a regular basis or even being exposed to them to a significant extent, can
      harm coders\u2019 minds? Can a programming language be blamed for limiting a
      software engineer\u2019s ability to form proper abstractions, communicate them
      to other members of the programming social unit, choose correctly among tools,
      techniques and constructs within the solution spaces, and altogether for boosting
      or ruining an engineer\u2019s career? If we knew, we could ensure language designers
      use methods that are least harmful when making new libraries, protocols and

      "title": "A SYNTAX DIRECTED APPROACH TO EXPLOIT PARALLELISM IN XML-QUERY LANGUAGES",
      "abstract": "The syntax analysis is a fundamental process to perform translation
      and parsing of a written text, determining the structure by the definition of
      a formal grammar and the generation of a syntax tree, which exhibits the rules
      used during the recognition of the input. The parser can perform other tasks
      (more or less complicated) other than the generation of the syntax tree by the
      use of semantic action, depending on the grammar that describes the target language
      under analysis, for example retrieving precise informations from a written text,
      taking into account its structure. PAPAGENO is a parallel parser generator written
      in Python that produces the C code necessary to execute parallel parsing on
      a text whose grammar satisfies the Operator Precedence Grammar (OPG) rules,
      also known as Floyd\u2019s Grammar. This grammar allows the split of a text
      in same dimension chunks and the parallel execution of the semantic analysis,
      granting each processor one of the chunks, without altering the final results,
      even with an out of order execution. The simultaneous use of more than one processor
      allows a speedup gain depending on the kind of semantic actions that has to
      be executed. The purpose of this thesis is to describe an extension of PAPAGENO
      through the implementation of all the semantic actions that allows the identification
      of the XML language while at the same moment some kind of information are retrieved
      from the input file, by means of a query described using the XPath language.
      All of this is done by exploiting the parallelism resulting from describing
      the input XML file using the OPG. Moreover, it follows a detailed description
      of how the program is implemented, the algorithm that handles all the special
      cases, the design and the implementation of a custom parallel lexer to further
      enhance the application and to exploit parallelism and the available computing
      power. Also, are shown the results obtained by intensive and close to reality
      test cases, and how performance can be improved albeit maintaining a general
      purpose approach against special purpose examples.", "venue": "", "year": 2015,

      Residual Method (GMRES) by Nils Ivo Dravins The generalized minimal residual
      method (GMRES) is an iterative method used to find numerical solutions to non-symmetric
      linear systems of equations. The method relies on constructing an orthonormal
      basis of the Krylov space and is thus vulnerable to an imperfect basis caused
      by computational errors. There have been attempts to address this issue by devising
      variations of the method that are less sensitive to poorly conditioned problems.
      The GMRES algorithm is typically used when the dimensions of the problem are
      very large, thus it is of interest to investigate ways in which the computational
      and memory cost of running it can be reduced. One method for doing so involves
      replacing the matrix-vector multiplications with an approximating function.
      This work compares variations of the GMRES algorithm against each other by using
      it as a solver in simulations mirroring real-world applications.", "venue":

      "title": "EE Framework of Theories GENERIC GOAL F 1 , F 2", "abstract": "Subjects
      live with objects1: they observe objects, create objects, and use objects. The
      \u03c4-theory (the Greek letter \u201c\u03c4\u201d is pronounced as \u201cTAO\u201d,
      which stands for \u201cTeleology Affordances Ontology\u201d) is a theory about
      subjects (with purposes) and objects (with properties), and the possible relationships
      between them. It is rooted in the philosophical branches of teleology, including
      praxeology (the economic study of human action), and of ontology, including
      mereology (the study of wholes and parts), and etiology (the study of causation),
      as well as in the theory of affordances, and in systemics (the holistic and
      mathematical study of systems). In ontology, objects are studied as they are,
      how hey are composed of parts, of which substance the parts are, how the parts
      are connected, etc., completely disregarding the purpose(s) subjects could use
      them for. The ontological point of view allows us to discern objects and their
      properties in an objective way. For example, you may observe a tree-stump (object),
      whose height is about 50 cm (property). In teleology, objects are studied as
      purposive entities. For example, human beings (subjects) are considered to have
      needs or desires and seek to satisfy them by using objects (including other
      human beings) in ways that satisfy their needs. In doing so, the subjects strive
      to achieve their purposes. This understanding of subjects and their purposes
      is sufficient for studying the \u03c4-theory. However, one may extend the theory
      by elaborating the praxeological part in teleology (including decision theory).
      This would lead to letting subjects attribute value to objects, depending on
      the degree in which the objects fit their purposes. We will elaborate this extension
      of the \u03c4theory also briefly. The teleological and ontological points of
      view are bridged by the notion of affordance2. The basic idea in the theory
      of affordances is that subjects, in their pursuit of satisfying needs, do not
      primarily perceive objects and their properties but the affordances that the
      objects offer them, i.e. the potential usages that the objects may have (which
      ultimately are made possible, of course, by the properties of the objects).
      For example, if you (subject) want to sit (purpose), you may perceive that you
      can sit (affordance) on the tree-stump (object) you see, because the height
      of its surface (property) fits your purpose. In order to refer to this affordance,
      Gibson would say that the tree-stump is \u2018sit-on-able\u2019 for you.", "venue":

      Dijkstra (1930\u20132002) is een informatica-icoon met een heel eigen plek.
      Van oorsprong theoretisch fysicus, werd hij in 1952 de eerste Nederlandse programmeur
      aan het Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam. Noodgedwongen werden toen programmatuur
      en documentatie geschreven voor een computer die nog gebouwd moest worden. De
      techniek schreed voort en de computer werd dagelijks onderdeel van vrijwel ieder
      beroep, maar Dijkstra bleef trouw aan het werken op papier. In zijn loopbaan
      was Dijkstra hoogleraar aan de Universiteit Eindhoven en de University of Texas
      at Austin. In 1972 ontving hij de prestigieuze Turing Award. Hij oogstte internationaal
      veel waardering en heeft nog altijd enthousiaste volgelingen, maar kwammet zijn
      kritische en rechtlijnige houding ook regelmatig in conflict met collega\u2019s.
      Dijkstra is vooral bekend om zijn algoritmen zoals het \u2018kortste pad-algoritme\u2019,
      zijn pioniers-werk aan gedistribueerde systemen, en zijn methode voor foutvrij
      programmeren: door een programma in stapjes te construeren uit de wiskundige
      specificatie, verkrijgt men een gegarandeerd correct product. De bijdrage die
      volgt is een manuscript uit zijn EWD-serie [1].", "venue": "", "year": 2009,

      "title": "User-Centered Design Considered Harmful 1 ( with apologies to", "abstract":
      "Studies of IT for development have often identiaed the importance of the usability
      of IT systems and the need for IT systems to be matched to the needs of host
      communities. These two issues are central concerns for the discipline of Human\u2013Computer
      Interaction (HCI), or Interaction Design. Within HCI and Interaction Design,
      user-centered design is just one particular view on how design processes can
      be organized to achieve such aims. This paper reports on discussions arising
      from a workshop held at the Computer/Human Interaction (CHI) 2007 conference
      in San Jose, California. CHI is the largest HCI conference in the world. The
      workshop brought together a group of 45 interaction designers and development
      practitioners from around the world and included participants from 17 countries,
      including many researchers and practitioners based in emerging economies such
      as India, China, South Africa, Namibia, and Benin. The aim of the workshop was
      to examine how interaction design could contribute to the success of IT for
      development. Although many issues were discussed, this is a necessarily selective
      report focusing on some of the principal themes of the workshop.", "venue":

      "title": "Reliability of Complex Services", "abstract": "In the relatively young
      history of computers, their capability has grown at an exponential rate \u2013
      both in hardware (see Moore\u2019s Law), and in software. Naturally, along with
      the increased potential came the greater magnitude of complexity. Where mainframes
      used to run isolated instructions from single programs, today\u2019s conditions
      require multiple interactions at every level \u2013 each CPU multitasks dozens
      of processes, servers manage their load between multiple CPUs, application tiers
      take advantage of server farms to manage load, service providers require multiple
      tiers for efficient services. An industrial-strength service architecture pushes
      the limits of descriptive reliability models, as the number of nodes and connections
      in dependency graphs of the service components grows rapidly. Without a doubt,
      the inherent complexity of service providers, whether it is a brokerage firm,
      an online retailer, a search engine or a portal, is significant. But on the
      other hand, the availability of the Internet and global access require these
      providers to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Reliability being
      a major concern, much of the marketing literature for service components is
      filled with terms like \u201cfive nines\u201d, signifying 99.999% availability
      \u2013 but in real life, we typically find that reliability is much less \u2013

      "title": "The end of computing science?", "abstract": "I would therefore like
      to posit that computing\u2019s central challenge, \u201cHow not to make a mess
      of it,\u201d has not been met. On the contrary, most of our systems are much
      more complicated than can be considered healthy, and are too messy and chaotic
      to be used in comfort and confidence. The average customer of the computing
      industry has been served so poorly that he expects his system to crash all the
      time, and we witness a massive worldwide distribution of bug-ridden software
      for which we should be deeply ashamed. For us scientists it is very tempting
      to blame the lack of education of the average engineer, the shortsightedness
      of the managers, and the malice of the entrepreneurs for this sorry state of
      affairs, but that won\u2019t do. You see, while we all know that unmastered
      complexity is at the root of the misery, we do not know what degree of simplicity
      can be obtained, nor to what extent the intrinsic complexity of the whole design
      has to show up in the interfaces. We simply do not know yet the limits of disentanglement.
      We do not know yet whether intrinsic intricacy can be distinguished from accidental
      intricacy. We do not know yet whether trade-offs will be possible. We do not
      know yet whether we can invent a meaningful concept for intracacy about which
      we can prove theorems that help. To put it bluntly, we simply do not know yet
      what we should be talking about, but that should not worry us, for it just illustrates
      what was meant by \u201cintangible goals and uncertain rewards.\u201d And this
      was only an example. The moral is that whether computing science is finished
      will primarily depend on our courage and our imagination.", "venue": "CACM",

      "Cantor''s Diagonalization The one purpose of this little Note is to show that
      formal arguments need not be lengthy at all; on the contrary, they are often
      the most compact rendering of the argument. Its other purpose is to show the
      strong heuristic guidance that is available to us when we design such calculational
      proofs in sufficiently small, explicit steps. We illustrate our approach on
      Georg Cantor''s classic diagonalization argument [chosen because, at the time,
      it created a sensation]. Cantor''s purpose was to show that any set S is strictly
      smaller than its powerset g9S (i.e., the set of all subsets of S). Because of
      the 1-1 correspondence between the elements of S and its singleton subsets,
      which are elements of gPS, S is not larger than gPS, and our proof can now be
      focussed on the \"strictly\", i.e., we have to show that there is no 1-1 correspondence
      between S and gUS. We can confine ourselves to non-empty S.", "venue": "The

      of proving the correctness of programs, predicates on the program\u2019s state
      space have played a central role. This role became essential when non-deterministic
      systems were considered. The first (and still best known) source of non-determinacy
      was provided by operating systems, which had to regulate the cooperation between
      components that had speed ratios that were beyond our control. Distributed systems
      have revived our interest in such configurations. I know of only one satisfactory
      way of reasoning about such systems: to prove that none of the atomic actions
      falsifies a special predicate, the so-called \u2018global invariant\u2019. Once
      initialized, the global invariant will then be maintained by any interleaving
      of the atomic actions. That solves the problem in principle; in each particular
      case, however, we have to choose how to write down the global invariant. The
      choice of notation influences the ease with which we can show that, indeed,
      none of the atomic actions falsifies the global invariant. An example will be
      given and discussed.", "venue": "Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society

      will fire back on us. If the truths are sufficiently unpalatable, our audience
      is psychically incapable of accepting them and we will be written off as totally
      unrealistic, hopelessly idealistic, dangerously revolutionary, foolishly gullible
      or what have you. (Besides that, telling such truths is a sure way of making
      oneself unpopular in many circles, and, as such, it is an act that, in general,
      is not without personal risks. Vide Galileo Galilei\u2026.)", "venue": "SIGP",

      "title": "Programming considered as a human activity", "abstract": "When looking
      back on any kind of movement or revolution, one always likes to point to a beginning:
      \"It began right there --- it all started with so-and-so''s famous speech .
      . . . \" \n \nIf structured programming can be thought of as a revolution, then
      surely Dijkstra''s landmark paper, \"Programming Considered as a Human Activity,\"
      published in 1965, marks its beginning. Virtually the entire gospel of structured
      programming is contained in a few short pages: the arguments against goto statements,
      the notion of top-down design, the emphasis on program correctness and quality
      (or \"elegance,\" as Dijkstra prefers to call it), and the strong argument against
      programs that modify themselves. \n \nIn addition to these fundamental concepts,
      there are some rather classic phrases that first appeared in this paper, and
      that have popped up in dozens of subsequent articles and books. For example,
      when discussing the \"divide and conquer\" approach characterizing top-down
      design, Dijkstra admits, \"I have only a very small head, and must live with
      it.\" What seems obvious to us today was a rather novel idea in 1965: the idea
      that while computers were --- and still are --- getting faster and more powerful,
      human beings weren''t. This theme is repeated again and again, and is essentially
      the entire subject matter of Dijkstra''s 1972 speech, \"The Humble Programmer\"
      [included as Paper 10 in this collection]. \n \nIt is in the 1965 paper, which
      you are about to read, that Dijkstra suggests that \"the quality of . . . programmers
      was inversely proportional to the density of goto statements in their programs.\"
      And, it is in this early paper as well that Dijkstra recounts programming experiments
      identical to the ones that converted most of the rest of us to structured programming
      over the next several years: He rewrote unstructured programs into equivalent
      structured programs, and marvelled at the increase in clarity. \n \nAfter reading
      all the pearls of wisdom that are contained in this one paper, one might well
      ask why the programming industry wasn''t converted at once. The answer, I think,
      has to do with timing and packaging. In 1965, most programmers (and their managers)
      felt that they had far more serious problems to worry about than eliminating
      goto statements\" After all, IBM had just unleashed the 360 upon the world,
      and whole armies of people began trying to upgrade from Autocoder to RPG ---
      that is, /f they could get the hardware and the operating system to work! Programmers
      spent most of their time trying to figure out how to use more gotos, not fewer
      --- in the hopes that doing so would help them fit some ponderous accounting
      application into an 8K machine! \n \nAnother reason for slow adoption of the
      methods was a factor as well of the medium in which the message was presented
      --- the IFIP Conference, which might be loosely thought of as the international
      version of the National Computer Conference. Prestigious and scholarly, to be
      sure, but its published papers attract a considerably smaller reading audience
      (at least in ~ the United States) than, say, ComputerworM or Datamation. Perhaps
      the only reason it attracted any American attention at all was that the IFIP
      Conference was held in New York City that year --- in contrast to the 1971 Conference,
      which was held in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia! \n \nAn additional problem preventing
      widespread conversion was with the language itself! Introductory quotations
      came from scientists Ludwig Boltzmann and George Boole, names with which the
      average programmer is unlikely to be acquainted. Examples chosen in support
      of the concepts involved prime factors of a twenty-digit number --- not a subject
      of intense interest to many programmers. Discussions in support of structured
      programming dealt with the features of ALGOL 60, well known to American programmers
      as one of their least popular languages. In short, it''s a wonder anyone read
      the paper at all! \n \nBut once you do read it, you can see why Dijkstra has
      the reputation he does. His writing is succinct and yet convincing. Reading
      Dijkstra, someone said, has been compared to eating marzipan --- it''s best
      to take very small bites, chew slowly, and digest the mouthful before moving
      on to the next bite.", "venue": "", "year": 1979, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

      "title": "On a political pamphlet from the middle ages", "abstract": "(The following
      commentary is reprinted from a personal memorandum of its author, with his acquiescence.
      PGN) This note concerns a very ugly paper [i]. Its authors seem to claim that
      trying to prove the correctness of programs is a futile effort, and therefore,
      a bad idea. To quote from the opening sentence: \"program verification [...]
      is bound to fail in its primary purpose: to dramatically increase one''s confidence
      in the correct functioning of a particular piece of software.\" As rendered
      above, this statement is obviously wrong: we all know of cases in which our
      confidence in the correct functioning of a particular piece of software has
      been increased dramatically by a proof of its correctness. The style of the
      paper is revealed by what I omitted: in the place indicated by \"[...]\" they
      had written \"as perceived by a large segment of the computer science community\".
      They give a complete caricature of program verification-suggesting, for instance,
      that on the average one line of program requires 66 (sic!) lines of formal correctness
      proof-, accuse without substantiation that \"a large segment of the computer
      science community\" accepts this nonsense as a fact of life, and then try to
      sell the great message that the computer science community has been misguided.
      That is what I call the style of a political pamphlet. They argue (rightly)
      that communication between mathematicians is an essential ingredient of our
      mathematical culture; they conclude that proofs of program correctness, not
      being communicated among colleagues, are therefore no good. How do they know
      that these proofs are not communicated and subjected to the judgement of others?
      Simply by painting them as so long, ugly, and boring that they are, now almost
      by definition, not fit for communication. They just ignore that how to prove-not
      in the silly ways they depict, but more elegantly-\"the correct functioning
      of particular pieces of software\" is the subject of a lively interchange of
      experiences between scientists active in the field. In short: again the unsubstantiated
      accusation that is characteristic for political pamphlets. ~hey argue (rightly)
      that long formal proofs are unconvincing, and subsequently discredit formal
      techniques, with an appeal to the work of Albert Meyer, by remarking that \"For
      even the most trivial mathematical theories, there are simple statements whose
      finite proofs are impossibly long.\" As if that matters! In most mathematical
      theories there are even simple statements that cannot be proved at all, \u2026",

      undertaking\u00b0 Due to lack ~f more time, this note is produced in the same
      manner as the previous four: it is composed while sitting at the keyboard. For
      linguistic imperfections I offer my apologies. My overwhelming impression is
      that, in particular in combination with the Revised \"IRONMAN\" Requirements-about
      which more later-the competitive situation in which the four design groups had
      been placed, has been disastrous. Instead of trying to design the most adequate
      programming language, they have all four tried to get the next contract, and
      that is a completely different thing! It has had two nasty consequences. Firstly
      the four reports I studied were all an almost inextricable mixture of technical
      documentation and salestalk, and that made their study unnecessaril~ difficult
      and unpleasant. It made the reading unpleasant because quite often the salestalk
      was so close to dishonesty or nonsense that my ability to approach the design
      with feelings of sympathy was severly strained. It made the study unnecessarily
      difficult in the sense, that they showed what was intended to be possible, but
      left to the reader to discover for himself what had been ruled OUt. Secondly
      the four designs have been much to \"obedient\" with respect to the IRONMAN
      Requirements. Now, if requirements are perfect, it should be a pleasure to try
      to comply with them; if requirements are not sensible, a design team should
      have had the liberty to point that out, but on the whole that liberty has hardly
      been taken; if requirements are contradictory, a design team should have pointed
      this out, but on the whole the designs have tried to cover this up. It is here
      that teams may.choose between the qualifications incompetent and dishonest;
      I blame the competitive situation for having placed them in that uncomfortable

      operating concurrently with the processor devoted to the computation proper.
      Exclusion and synchronization constraints have been kept as weak as could be

      "abstract": "According to Webster''s definition of a tutorial: \u201ca paper
      and esp. a technical paper written to give practical information about a specific
      subject\u201d, this paper is not worthy of the name \u201ctutorial\u201d, because
      I would never describe what I intend to do as \u201cgiving practical information\u201d.
      On the contrary: I intend to give as little \u201cpractical information\u201d
      as I possibly can. I am not going to enumerate facts, results and theories,
      for those you can find\u2014in abundance, I am tempted to add\u2014in the published
      literature. What I do hope to achieve, however, is helping you to understand
      and evaluate those facts, results and theories when you encounter them in the
      literature. I intend to do so by providing you with a historical perspective,
      be it\u2014in more than one sense\u2014a partial one. It is a lucky circumstance
      that the amateur historian, like myself, can always come away with very few
      facts: the fewer the facts, the greater our freedom of interpretation, and it
      is that freedom that I intend to enjoy.\n For a short while we have to go back
      to the scientific climate at the beginning of this century, for there we seem
      to find the roots of the philosophical opinions that prevailed a few decades
      later. And these philosophical opinions, in turn, seem to be the source of today''s
      tacit assumptions. By being tacit, these assumptions tend to escape being challenged
      and that is bad, because they are third-generation off-spring of scientific
      hopes that, in the mean time, have been shown to have been unjustified, they
      express everyman''s image of a goal that, in the mean time, has been proved
      to be unattainable.", "venue": "Reliable Software", "year": 1975, "referenceCount":

      work: (1) Compared with other fields of intellectual activity, mathematical
      assertions tend to be unusually precise. (2) Mathematical assertions tend to
      be general in the sense that they are applicable to a large (often infinite)
      class of instances. (3) Mathematics embodies a discipline of reasoning allowing
      such assertions to be made with an unusually high confidence level.", "venue":

      "A systematic way for finding the algorithm ensuring some desired form of co-operation
      between a set of loosely coupled sequential processes can in general terms be
      described as folIows: the relation \"the system is in a legitimate state\" is
      kept invariant. As a consequence, each intended individual process step that
      could possibly cause violation of that invariant relation has to be preceded
      by a test that it won''t do so, and depending on the outcome of that test the
      critical process step is either caused to take place or it -and with it the
      process of which it is a partis delayed until a more favourable system state
      has been reached. With a suitable choice of the set of legitimate states one
      can indeed introduce the rule that a critical process step will be delayed only
      as long as its execution would lead to violation of the corresponding invariant
      relation. The resulting design is readily implemented if the different sequential
      processes can be granted mutually exclusive access to a common store in which
      the current system state is recorded. Then a relation between (the values of)
      the variables in that commonly accessible store is the core of what we could
      call \"the centralized control\". A complication arises when there is no such
      commonly accessible store and \"the system state\" must be recorded in variables
      distributed over the various processes, and furthermore the communication facilities
      are limited in the sense that each process can only exchange information with
      \"its neighbours\", a (possibly smalI) sub set of the total set of processes.
      (We can view the processes as nodes of a connected graph in which each of the
      (sparse) set of edges denotes the neighbour relation.) The complication is that
      a node''s behaviour can only be influenced by the part of the total system state
      description that is available in that node: local actions taken on account of
      local information must accomplish a global objective. Such", "venue": "", "year":

      "title": "Letters to the editor: go to statement considered harmful", "abstract":
      "For a number of years I have been familiar with the observation that the quality
      of programmers is a decreasing function of the density of go to statements in
      the programs they produce. More recently I discovered why the use of the go
      to statement has such disastrous effects, and I became convinced that the go
      to statement should be abolished from all \"higher level\" programming languages
      (i.e. everything except, perhaps, plain machine Code). At''that time I did not
      attach too much importance to this discovery ; I now submit my considerations
      for publication because in very recent discussions in which the subject turned
      up, I have been urged to do so. My first remark is that, although the programmer''s
      activity ends when he has constructed a correct program, the process taking
      place under control of his program is the true subject matter of his activity,
      for it is this process that has to accomplish the desired effect; it is this
      process that in its dynamic behavior has to satisfy the desired specifications.
      Yet, once the program has been made, the \"making\" of the corresponding process
      is delegated to the machine. My second remark is that our intellectual powers
      are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize
      processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason
      we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten
      the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make
      the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process
      (spread out in time) as trivial as possible. Let us now consider how we can
      characterize the progress of a process. (You may think about this question in
      a very concrete manner: suppose that a process, considered as a time succession
      of actions, is stopped after an arbitrary action, what data do we have to fix
      in order that we can redo the process until the very same point?) If the program
      text is a pure concatenation of, say, assignment statements (for the purpose
      of this discussion regarded as the descriptions of single actions) it is sufficient
      to point in the program text to a point between two successive action descriptions.
      (In the absence of go to statements I can permit myself the syntactic ambiguity
      in the last three words of the previous sentence: if we parse \u2026", "venue":

      "Although the above errors are most likely typographical in origin, there is
      an omission which makes the program recurse to infinite depth upon encountering
      ''( '' in the input string. When procedure \"p r imary\" is evoked and encounters
      ''( '' it then evokes procedure \"expression\" without updating the position
      of the pointer in the input string. Hencewhen \"pr imary\" is again evoked,
      and encounters '' ( '' , the process is repeated. To correct this, I inserted
      a call to procedure \" scan\" between lines 61 and 62, which also eliminates
      the need to position the input pointer at the first character prior to calling
      procedure \"express ion\" initially. The algorithm was then coded in Raytheon

      "A regenerative air preheater has a heat-exchange sector plate centered on an
      axis and formed with a multiplicity of axially throughgoing passages with intake
      and output heating-gas hoods axially flanking the plate and conduits for passing
      a heating gas from the intake hood through the plate to the output hood for
      heating the plate. Intake and output secondary heated-gas hoods each within
      one of the heating-gas hoods and axially flanking the plate are axially aligned
      with each other and only cover a portion of the plate. Thus the heating gas
      can pass through the plate only around the plate portion covered by the secondary
      hoods. Intake and output primary heated-gas hoods within the respective secondary
      hoods and axially flanking the plate are axially aligned with each other and
      only cover a subportion of the plate portion covered by the secondary hoods.
      Thus the secondary gas will be heated at regions of the plate portion not covered
      by the primary hoods. A drive rotates the secondary hoods synchronously with
      each other about the axis in a predetermined rotational sense. Thus the heating
      gas will heat regions of the plate not covered by the secondary hoods so that
      when same move into alignment with these heated regions the secondary gas stream
      will be heated. Portions of the primary hoods can be displaced nonaxially within
      the respective secondary hoods and to vary the heat-exchange between the primary
      stream and the plate.", "venue": "", "year": 1964, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

      advocated separation of data and instructions, were branded as reactionaries.
      Today we seem to be coming back to the idea of special-purpose features and
      special stores for different categories of data and instructions. For instance,
      the Atlas has four different memories for different categories of information,
      and machines with lockout bits or memory limit registers effectively use these
      to differentiate between categories of memory. Before we advocate hardware to
      implement compilers, we should be clear that we are advocating more special-purpose
      features. The question is whether that is entirely a good thing. I probably
      think it is. After all, the most .general machine is a Turing machine, and nobody
      complains about arithmetic and even floating-point facilities. However, I think
      that we should be clear about the implication of advocating specialpurpose features.
      Dr. Clippinger: If we built FACT again, we could do it for fewer man-years.
      I doubt whether the factor is as high as 100. 1 believe that there is an irreducible
      minimum involved in something as complex as FACT and that we might get the figure
      down to ten man-years. If we did, it is an interesting exercise to extrapolate
      in order to estimate the time which might be taken for the tenth edition of
      FACT! In the process of doing this, we are learning about compilers and the
      better ways of handling them, and how to get the job done for fewer man-years.
      But this has no effect on the end result, which is what the programmer is using.
      That point should be kept clearly in mind. Mr. d''Agapeyeff: I do not believe
      that compiler readability will lead to special-purpose machines. It is a general-purpose
      tool although it can have a wide variety of uses for many other things and certainly
      we have used it for purposes which were never thought of originally. Special-purpose
      input/output or the use of interpretative or semi-interpretative techniques
      will require better machine design. The Deputy-Chairman: There is no more time
      for questions, but if anyone has anything more to say, he will not have much
      difficulty about re-phrasing his question to make it appropriate to another
      session. (Laughter.) I am sure that you would not like the session to conclude
      without thanking the three speakers who have given our conference such a good
      start. (Applause.) The Conference Adjourned.", "venue": "Computer/law journal",

      Problem 1. Constrnct the tree of minimum total length between the n nodes. (A
      tree is a graph with one and only one path between every two nodes.) In the
      course of the construction that we present here, the branches are subdivided
      into three sets: I. the branches definitely assignec~ to the tree under construction
      (they will form a subtree) ; II. the branches from which the next branch to
      be added to set I, will be selected ; III. the remaining branches (rejected
      or not yet considered). The nodes are subdivided into two sets: A. the nodes
      connected by the branches of set I, B. the remaining nodes (one and only one
      branch of set II will lead to each of these nodes), We start the construction
      by choosing an arbitrary node as the only member of set A, and by placing all
      branches that end in this node in set II. To start with, set I is empty. From
      then onwards we perform the following two steps repeatedly. Step 1. The shortest

      "title": "Software Engineering: A Profession in Waiting", "abstract": "F or
      more than 50 years, people concerned about software development have tried to
      make it a profession like medicine or civil engineering.1 Those who started
      discussing \u201csoftware engineering\u201d in the 1960s had been trained in
      other fields; their work required computation and that led them to writing programs\u2014often
      for their own use. A few were writing programs that would be used by others;
      such programs became known as software. Some of them observed that they were
      doing something very different from what they had been taught to do. They had
      been educated as mathematicians or scientists. Software development was more
      like engineering. They had been trained to extend knowledge but were now applying
      that knowledge to build products. That thought suggested the term software engineering.

      structure is at least as important as the ability to design efficient algorithms
      or write code in a particular programming language. Although the word \u201cstructure\u201d
      appeared in the paper\u2019s title and was used seven more times, Dijkstra never
      defined the term. Closer examination revealed that he was discussing at least
      three distinct structures. His failure to define \u201cstructure,\u201d or to
      clearly distinguish the structures that were important in his software, has
      led many to confuse those structures. This article aims to clarify what those

      approach to problem solving that I had learned as a student of physics, electrical
      engineering, and mathematics. Science and engineering classes stressed careful
      (measurement-based) definitions; the AI lectures used vague concepts with unmeasurable
      attributes. My engineering teachers showed me how to use physics and mathematics
      to thoroughly analyze problems and products; my AI teachers relied almost entirely
      on intuition. I distinguished three types of AI research: \u02f2 building programs
      that imitate human behavior in order to understand human thinking; \u02f2 building
      programs that play games well; and \u02f2 showing that practical computerized
      products can use the methods that humans use. Computerized models can help researchers
      understand brain function. However, as illustrated by Joseph Weizenbaum, a model

      "Tabular expressions have been proposed as a notation to document mathematically
      precise but readable software specifications. One of the many roles of such
      documentation is to guide testers. This paper 1) explores the application of
      four testing strategies (the partition strategy, decision table-based testing,
      the basic meaningful impact strategy, and fault-based testing) to tabular expression-based
      specifications, and 2) compares the strategies on a mathematical basis through
      formal and precise definitions of the subsumption relationship. We also compare
      these strategies through experimental studies. These results will help researchers
      improve current methods and will enable testers to select appropriate testing
      strategies for tabular expression-based specifications.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions

      it is worthwhile to study programs from the set by first studying the common

      a commercial concept motivated by market analysis and usually determined by

      Road Software Why are Program Families and Product Lines Confused? There are
      many benefits to having a product line be a program family. \u2022 Reduced maintenance
      costs \u2022 Faster, more predictable additions to product line \u2022 More
      reuse \u2022 Products can have company \u201cimage\u201d. The more these products
      have in common, the more advantages you have. If you look at software products
      closely, you will find many unnecessary differences reducing benefits. A critical
      research question is how designers can reduce or eliminate such differences
      and increase benefits. Middle Road Software 2/43 David Parnas ! ! ! ! ! ! !

      is computer science \" folk wisdom \" that our computer systems, particularly
      the networks, are unnecessarily vulnerable because so many of our systems are
      either made by Microsoft, highly dependent on Microsoft software, or required
      to interact with Microsoft software. Many see this as a single point of failure,
      an Achilles'' heel. Analogies are drawn to situations such as many people concentrated
      in a dangerous area, large quantities of hazardous materials stored in one place,
      or systems reliant on a single power source. Many propose that we can decrease
      our vulnerability by insisting on the use of non-Windows operating systems\u2014thereby
      increasing diversity. In this column, I question that view. Diversity, when
      combined with redundancy, is a well-established approach to increasing the reliability
      of safety-critical systems. For example, having two independent pumps, either
      of which is adequate, may decrease the probability of a complete outage; using
      two pumps of diverse manufacture may make it less likely that both fail at once.
      Predictions that diversity will increase reliability assume: \u2022 Redundancy:
      The system must be functional even if one pump fails. \u2022 Independence: The
      failure of one pump must not make the failure of the other more likely, and
      the pumps must not depend on shared resources. \u2022 Deep diversity: The pumps
      must be fundamentally different so that they are unlikely to have common design
      faults. \u2022 Interoperability: The pumps must function well together. If not,
      the number of failures may increase. The validity of these assumptions must
      be carefully examined in each individual situation; they do not seem to apply
      to today''s computer systems. That increasing diversity does not always improve
      reliability is obvious if we think of automobile traffic. We would not make
      our roads safer by demanding that 30% of us switch to the other side of the
      road. On the roads there is limited redundancy and independence. All drivers
      are essential; a failure of one affects many others. Further, cars driven with
      different rules would not be interoperable. Examining the case at hand we see:
      \u2022 In today''s computer systems, there is remarkably little redundancy.
      When a Canadian tax system failed, no tax returns could be submitted. Basing
      the Irish system on a different OS would not have helped. Having two diverse
      Canadian systems would help only if they implemented exactly the same rules.
      \u2022 In today''s OS market, diversity is shallow. Linux, and the various \u2026",

      "abstract": "Computer Scientists have been talking about the use of of object-orientation
      (under a variety of rubrics) to achieve \"separation of concerns\" for more
      than 40 years. In all that time, it has been taken for granted that it was the
      structure of the program text itself that mattered. Whenever it was felt that
      additional information was needed it was assumed that this would be closely
      associated with the program text either as simple comments, as in-line assertions,
      or \"woven\" in with the program text using elaborate tools.\n This talk takes
      a different position. It argues that for true separation of concerns we need
      an integrated set of separate documents, some of which are to be read by people
      who will never read the code, some that describe the structure of the code,
      and some that describe the behaviour of individual components. It describes
      a collection of mathematical ideas and notations that make it possible to produce
      documentation that is both precise and readable. We then describe the use of
      these documents in testing and inspection. Finally, it discusses the way that
      other programming paradigms, particularly functional programming, can be used

      "title": "Wikipedia risks", "abstract": "The Wikipedia (WP; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)
      applies the wiki technology (from a Hawaiian word for \u201cquick\u201d) to
      the encyclopedia, a venerable form of knowledge organization and dissemination.
      Wikipedia provides a fast and flexible way for anyone to create and edit encyclopedia
      articles without the delay and intervention of a formal editor or review process.
      The WP\u2019s over 750,000 articles are written and edited by volunteers. WP
      founder Jimmy Wales believes WP\u2019s free, open, and largely unregulated process
      will evolve toward an Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica or better quality. But will
      this process actually yield a reliable, authoritative reference encompassing
      the entire range of human knowledge? Opinions are mixed. WP claims to be the
      most popular reference site on the Internet. It has been hailed as the quintessence
      of the \u201cwisdom of crowds,\u201d as a model of democratized information,
      and as a nail in the coffin of the \u201cstodgy old commercial encyclopedia.\u201d
      Others are concerned about the reliability of an uncontrolled reference work
      that may include any number of purposeful or accidental inaccuracies. Some observers
      wonder why anyone would accept information from anonymous strangers of unknown
      qualifications. WP\u2019s first editor in chief, Larry Sanger, believes that
      an anti-expertise bias among \u201cWikipedians\u201d foreshadows the death of
      accuracy in scholarship (\u201cWhy Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism\u201d;
      www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25). Robert McHenry, former editor
      of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, is even more blunt in asserting that the community-accretion
      process of Wikipedia is fundamentally incapable of rising to a high standard
      of excellence (\u201cThe Faith-Based Encyclopedia\u201d; www.techcentralstation.com/111504A.html).
      Regardless of which side you\u2019re on, relying on Wikipedia presents numerous
      risks: \u2022 Accuracy: You cannot be sure which information is accurate and
      which is not. Misinformation has a negative value; even if you get it for free,
      you\u2019ve paid too much. \u2022 Motives: You cannot know the motives of the
      contributors to an article. They may be altruists, political or commercial opportunists,
      practical jokers, or even vandals. \u2022 Uncertain Expertise: Some contributors
      exceed their expertise and supply speculations, rumors, hearsay, or incorrect
      information. It is difficult to determine how qualified an article\u2019s contributors
      are; the revision histories often identify them by pseudonyms, making it difficult
      to check credentials and sources. \u2022 Volatility: Contributions and corrections
      may be negated by future contributors. One of the coauthors of this column found
      it disconcerting that he had the power to independently alter the Wikipedia
      article about himself. Volatility creates a conundrum for citations: Should
      you cite the version of the article that you read (meaning that those who follow
      your link may miss corrections and other improvements), or the latest version
      (which may differ significantly from the article you saw)? \u2022 Coverage:
      Voluntary contributions largely represent the interests and knowledge of a self-selected
      set of contributors. They are not part of a careful plan to organize human knowledge.
      Topics that interest the young and Internet-savvy are wellcovered, while events
      that happened \u201cbefore the Web\u201d may be covered inadequately or inaccurately,
      if at all. More is written about current news than about historical knowledge.
      \u2022 Sources: Many articles do not cite independent sources. Few articles
      contain citations to works not digitized and stored in the open Internet. The
      foregoing effects can pollute enough information to undermine trust in the work
      as a whole. The WP organizers are aware of some of these risks, acknowledging
      that \u201cWikipedia contains no formal peer review process for fact-checking,
      and the editors themselves may not be well-versed in the topics they write about.\u201d
      The organizers have established a background editorial process to mitigate some
      of the risks. Still, no one stands officially behind the authenticity and accuracy
      of any information in WP. There is no mechanism for subject-matter authorities
      to review and vouch for articles. There are no processes to ferret out little-known
      facts and include them, or to ensure that the full range of human knowledge,
      past and present, is represented. The Wikipedia is an interesting social experiment
      in knowledge compilation and codification. However, it cannot attain the status
      of a true encyclopedia without more formal content-inclusion and expert review
      procedures.", "venue": "CACM", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

      "It is no accident that the branches of engineering are called \"disciplines\".
      Every properly educated engineer has learned that the design of quality products
      requires discipline and a willingness to follow standard procedures. Engineers
      understand that they must produce a specified set of documents and perform a
      variety of analyses whose results must be included in the documents. Engineers
      who do these things are less likely to produce a defective product. In many
      jurisdictions, engineers who fail to follow the standard discipline may be considered
      to have been negligent. Software development should not be different but most
      developers have not been taught the appropriate discipline and neither their
      employers nor the customers know what to demand. At the heart of the problem
      is our failure to agree on a set of documents that contain analyzable descriptions
      and specifications. We begin with highly simplified \"models\" that have a vague
      resemblance. Most of these models have properties that could never be implemented

      make simplifying assumptions (for example, a 1:1 correspondence between variables

      products are too large to be completed by a single person in short period. To
      make the development manageable, the software must be divided into components
      that can be developed (and later maintained) separately. Each component will
      be a work assignment for a team or individual. It is often thought that this
      decomposition is a management decision, determined primarily by the talent available.
      This lecture explains that the decomposition is a critical design decision to
      be made on the basis of simple technical criteria, which will be stated and
      illustrated. The result is a very unconventional, but easily maintained, design.

      is a \u201clarge program\u201d? \u2022 One too large to be written by one person
      in a few days. Why are large programs different? \u2022 There are many tiny
      details. \u2022 It is difficult, often impossible to keep all of those details
      in mind all the time. \u2022 When there are several programmers, nobody is familiar
      with everything in the program. \u2022 If the program is written over a period
      of more than a few days, people forget the details of what they have done. \u2022
      Errors in one part often affect other parts. How should we respond to these
      problems? \u2022 We organise programs into components called modules. \u2022
      Production of a module is a piece of work for a programmer or a group of programmers.
      \u2022 Modules can be subdivided into smaller modules. \u2022 Even individuals
      organise their work in modules. Is modularisation an engineering issue? \u2022
      Some treat it as management: assigning people work. \u2022 There are technical
      issues: issues independent of the people available. \u2022 Dividing a program
      into modules is the subject of this lecture. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH

      Manufacturers learned to build parts that measured one such unit as this simplified
      both their job and that of the customers. The word now means the parts themselves.
      Modules are usually relatively self-contained systems that are combined to make
      a larger system. Design is often the assembly of many previously designed modules.
      The assembly of a system made of modules is usually best done if the interfaces
      are simple and well-understood by all involved. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH

      2003 22:53 The Constraints on Modules If the modules are hardware, how you put
      them together is obvious; there are well-known physical constraints. There is
      a well-identified time at which modules are assembled to get the larger system.
      If the modules are software, there are no obvious constraints. Theoretically
      software modules can be arbitrarily large, their interfaces arbitrarily complex.
      During software development there are several different times at which parts
      are combined to form a whole. During software development there are several
      different ways of putting parts together to get the whole. The result is that
      words like \u201cmodule\u201d and components have become buzzwords in the software
      industry. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH LABORATORY \u2022 University of Limerick

      Parts Assembled? A. While writing software \u2022 parts: work assignments for
      programmer(s) \u2022 when: files containing programs combined before compilation
      or execution. B. When \u201clinking\u201d object programs. \u2022 parts: separately
      assembled (compiled) programs with \u201crelative\u201d addressing \u2022 when:

      program in limited memory. \u2022 parts: memory loads data and programs that
      refer to each other by memory addresses \u2022 when: while the program is running.
      The word \u201cmodule\u201d is used in programming literature for all three
      of these! The ambiguity in the word leads to confusion. I will talk only about

      -modules should be as small as possible. Researcher, \u201cToo many small modules
      led to memory thrashing\u201d. Belief in many small modules was based on work
      assignment interpretation of that word. Implementation used memory management

      for the Next Hour In this lecture, modules are always write-time or change-time
      entities. I want them to have the following properties: \u2022 They can be designed
      and changed independently. \u2022 They can be divided into smaller modules.
      \u2022 They are good candidates for reuse in future software. When do we stop
      subdividing modules? \u2022 When they are so small that it is easier to write
      a new one than to change it. \u2022 When the cost of specifying the interface
      exceeds the expected benefit of having smaller modules. The concept of \u201cmodule\u201d
      as a work assignment is only a definition. Designers need criteria for judging
      a proposed decomposition and guidelines for finding a good decomposition. \u2022

      seminal work [2] on separation of concerns in design has led to diverse innovations
      in programming language design, to support modularity. However, there has been
      a growing sentiment in many quarters that there are some concerns that stubbornly
      resist tidy confinement, when using established modularization mechanisms in
      pro- gramming languages. A diverse set of new approaches have emerged in response:
      aspects [1], monads [5], mixin lay- ers [3], and multi-dimensional separation
      of concerns [4]. These approaches arose more or less independently of each other,
      and have (to varying degrees) developed technical maturity, real-world credibility
      and strong user bases. We are also now beginning to see strong scholarly comparisions
      of the intellectual foundations and practical utility of these different aproaches.
      This panel aims to support this trend. In this panel, we bring together leading

      2003 16:30 Applying \u201cInformation Hiding\u201d to \u201cEmbedded Systems\u201d
      In so-called embedded systems it is the external interface that is likely to
      change. In many of those systems, the software is perceived as a minor component
      and changes in the external system will be made without taking software costs
      into account. In this situation, we should use an \u201cabstract interface\u201d
      to \u201chide\u201d the actual interface. Current fad is to ignore requirements
      (not determine or document them) that are likely to change. My approach is the
      opposite; it identifies the changeable requirements and designs the software
      to make subsequent changes easier. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH LABORATORY

      16:30 Abstract Interfaces What do we mean by abstract? 1. Not vague, theoretical
      or highly mathematical; abstract means expressing a general property. 2. Abstract
      implies a many-to-one mapping. 3. The abstraction represents many things equally
      well. 4. The abstraction models some aspects of the real things, but not all.
      5. Eliminating detail is the approach: The interesting issue is which details
      should be eliminated. Eliminate the details that are likely to change. 6. Examples
      of abstractions: 1. Circuit diagrams Physical layout is hidden. 1. Graphs Meaning
      of nodes and arcs is hidden. 1. Algorithms abstract from restrictions of programming
      languages. 1. Abstract Data types Representation is hidden. \u2022 SOFTWARE

      15 February 2003 16:30 Abstractions Why are abstractions useful? \u2022 If all
      properties of the abstract system correspond to properties of the real system,
      we can learn about the real system by studying the abstraction. \u2022 Abstraction
      is simpler (in principle); \u2022 It has less information, but \u2022 It may
      appear more complex because it is described using unfamiliar notation. \u2022
      Results about abstraction may be \u201creused\u201d. \u2022 They apply in many
      situations those situations that share the abstraction and differ only in things
      that are abstracted from. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH LABORATORY \u2022

      Abstract Interfaces What is an abstract interface? \u2022 One interface that
      represents many possible actual interfaces equally well. \u2022 An interface
      that models some properties of actual interface but not all. \u2022 A (proper)
      subset of the set of assumptions in the actual interface. All of the assumptions
      must be true. A lie is not an abstraction. \u2022 All things true of the abstract
      interface must be true of actual interface. \u2022 An infinite stack is not
      an abstraction; no stack is infinite. \u2022 Every stack has a limit. \u2022
      A stack with a parameter representing maximum capacity is an abstraction. \u2022
      The parameterised interface applies to many stacks. \u2022 It will not apply
      to all stacks if you assume that the parameter\u2019s value must be a constant
      independent of the values stored in the stack. Abstractions can introduce restrictions
      but do so consciously. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH LABORATORY \u2022 University
      of Limerick 8 /33 interfacedesignslides.fm 15 February 2003 16:30 How can Interface
      Hiding modules be used in Embedded Systems? 1. Study the real-world interfaces
      to learn what is possible, likely, unlikely. 2. Define an abstract interface
      that covers those you are likely to encounter. 3. Procure applications programs
      based on abstract interface. 4. Procure (separately) programs that translate
      between real interface and the abstract interface. Real World", "venue": "",

      software inspection. The workshop included invited lectures and paper presentations
      in the form of panel discussions on all aspects of software inspection. Submissions
      explained how practitioners and researchers were performing inspections, discussed
      the relevance of inspections, provided evidence of how inspections could be

      multiples of 10. This does not meet patient\u2019s requirements. Software requirements
      were never documented or reviewed by users. Those with a resting heart rate
      between the possible set points will have to chose between too low and too high.
      Some of the parameters not meaningful to doctors they use default values. No

      /45 req_slides_landscape.fm 2/2/03 What Could we do with Mathematical Descriptions
      of software? (1) Describe software products that we already have so that people
      can answer questions about them without reading the code. (2) Write specifications
      for software products we do not yet have so that the programmers and clients
      can reach agreement on the requirements. (3) Verify that a product meets its
      requirements (testing and/or inspection). (4) Build tools to check specifications
      (5) Build tools to simulate systems and check systems. What are the Acceptance
      Criteria for the Descriptions? (1) Descriptions must be easier to understand
      than the code. (2) Documentation must state the requirements in a way that does
      not restrict the solutions unnecessarily. (3) Testing and proof could eventually
      be automated. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH LABORATORY \u2022 University

      the mathematics we used to use? \u2022 Wrong Answer: Conventional products are
      inanimate objects. \u2022 Wrong Answer: We need to describe the procedure followed

      The Purpose of a Requirements Document We are talking about a technical document
      written for developers. \u2022 Requirements documentation should not be a sales
      pitch! \u2022 Requirements documentation should not be an introduction. \u2022
      Requirements documentation should serve as a reference document during development.
      \u2022 Requirements documentation should prevent programmers from taking unilateral
      decisions that should be made with others. \u2022 Requirements documentation
      should be used for design reviews. \u2022 Requirements documentation should
      be used for test case generation and test result evaluation. \u2022 Requirements
      documentation should be used, and kept up to date, during maintenance. \u2022
      Requirements documentation can be modified to specify revisions. \u2022 SOFTWARE

      2 /2/03 The Goals of the Requirements Phase A. Decide what to build before starting
      to build it: \u2022 Make \u201cwhat decisions\u201d explicitly before design,
      not implicitly during design. \u2022 Make sure you build what is needed. \u2022
      Allow future users, or representatives, to comment before the product is built.
      B. Provide an organised reference document for the software developers: \u2022
      Provide accurate, consistent information. \u2022 Answer constraint questions
      only once. \u2022 Relieve them of any need to decide what is best for the user.
      \u2022 Compensate for their ignorance of the application environment. \u2022
      Give them the information needed to make good design decisions. \u2022 Allow

      on the implementation \u2022 Know what you''re up against. \u2022 Have some
      \u201cprotection\u201d against customer changes. \u2022 Be able to judge feasibility
      and cost. F. Specify constraints for future revisions. Note: A requirements
      document is not a \u201cwrite, use (at most) once and discard\u201d document.
      A good document, properly maintained, will be useful until the product is discarded

      Down Requirements The most costly errors are those made early in the process
      Early errors are the hardest to change. Misunderstandings about requirements
      lead to early mistakes. Programmers need to be told what is needed now; they
      must also be told what is subject to change. Requirements must be subject to
      review. Safety reviews of software should be based on the statement of requirements,
      not the code. Maintenance actions must be based on requirements. None of this
      is possible unless we have a written statement to work with. That written statement
      must be precise and complete. That written statement must be organized for reference
      so that information appears in a specified place and will not be missing or

      The Documents that Software Dependant Organisations Need 1. A Requirements Document
      that tells the users exactly what they will get and tells the programmers exactly
      what to build. \u2022 The challenge is to use one document that is useful to
      both groups. 2. A Module-guide that guides reviewers and maintenance-programmers
      to exactly the programs that will be affected by a proposed change. \u2022 For
      all who work on the project, it is restricted in the designs to which it applies
      3. A set of Module Interface Specifications that tell programmers what they
      must build and other programmers, what they can expect of a module. \u2022 This
      is the only information read by both those who build the module and those who
      use it. 4. A set of Module Internal Design Documents that (1) record major internal
      design decisions for reviewers, (2) guide the programmers in their coding, (3)
      help maintainers to understand the code. \u2022 This information is only for
      developers/maintainers of the module in question. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH

      know how\u201d. Imagine trying to develop an automobile if you do not know how
      to specify the thread on nuts and bolts. Imagine trying to develop electronic
      devices and systems if we do not know how to specify impedance, voltage, current,
      inductance, frequency response. Imagine trying to produce for the petroleum
      industry if you do not know how to specify viscosity, octane level, etc. Imagine
      trying to design electronic circuits without a knowledge of circuit theory.
      You do not have to imagine trying to produce software systems without knowing
      how to specify component properties. We do it every day. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY

      24 February 2003 17:00 Never Build on Sand Software is among the most complex
      of products. We cannot hope to keep such products under intellectual control,
      unless we build on a solid, sound, well understood foundation. If \u2022 we
      don\u2019t know the meaning of our notation, or \u2022 we don\u2019t know the
      associated rules of inference, or if \u2022 those rules are complex and conditional,
      using that notation will not help us to understand what we are doing. To build
      complex products all design notations must have a sound and simple mathematical
      basis. Today, many people promote Undefined Modelling Languages (UMLs) as a
      solution. Without a precise definition of their meaning, UMLs become part of
      the problem, not the solution. Retrofit of definitions, never works. Once people
      start using vaguely defined notations, the definitions proliferate like weeds.

      Time into the Picture All of these variables can vary with time. For each scalar
      variable, x, denote the time-function describing its value by \u201cxt\u201d.
      The value of x at time t is denoted \u201cxt (t)\u201d. The vector of time-functions
      (v1, v t 2, ..., vn) will be denoted by \u201cvt\u201d. Contrary to the statements
      by some computer scientists, there is no problem dealing with \u201creal\u201d
      time. No new mathematics is needed. For many systems, the time functions may
      be replaced by functions of event sequences. \u2022 SOFTWARE QUALITY RESEARCH

      are self-regulating. In each of these fields: \u2022 Practitioners deal directly
      with the general public, most of whom cannot determine whether or not a self-proclaimed
      expert is qualified to provide the required service. \u2022 Proper practice
      requires the practitioner understand an organized body of knowledge and have
      learned how to apply that knowledge through both book knowledge and supervised
      practice. \u2022 Practitioner errors can cause a great deal of harm to clients
      or the public. \u2022 There are established codes of practice that must be enforced.
      The enforcers must be able to stop an unqualified or negligent professional
      from offering services to the public. Because regulating these professions requires
      expertise , many legislatures have created governing bodies whose primary duty
      is protecting the public. These bodies are not to be confused with advocacy
      groups, which advance the interests of the professionals, or with technical
      societies, such as ACM or IEEE, which promulgate scientific knowledge. Professional
      regulatory authorities exist to restrain practitioners in the interest of the
      public. The legislation requires them to control a title by examining the qualifications
      of potential practitioners; licensing all who are qualified to practice; and
      removing the license of those who do not practice properly. Like all human institutions,
      these bodies are far from perfect. It can be difficult to distinguish between
      poor practices and innovative ones; the line between protection of the public
      and advancing the interests of the professionals can be fuzzy. The jurisdictions
      of two professions may appear to overlap. Nonetheless, the overall effect of
      self-regulation has been positive. When I walk into a doctor''s office, I may
      not get the world''s best doctor, but I am very unlikely to get a completely
      unqualified and negligent practitioner. I do not have to study my doctor''s
      credentials and quiz her to determine whether or not she took the appropriate
      courses. The license on the wall, or a call to the medical association, assures
      me that she is qualified to practice and aware of her legal and ethical obligations.
      Legislation to regulate engineering was introduced in response to exploding
      boilers and collapsing bridges. All Canadian provinces, and most U.S. states,
      have regulatory bodies charged with making sure that qualified engineers are
      easy to identify; making sure that (licensed) engineers remain qualified; and
      regulatory bodies removing the license of engineers who violate laws or codes
      of practice. They have been granted trademarks and other \u2026", "venue": "CACM",

      "title": "Definition and Documentation of Software Architectures", "abstract":
      "This paper discusses the work of the software architect by describing a software
      architect\u2019s concerns and the documents that a software architect should
      produce. It proposes a definition of software architecture and discusses archtectural
      design criteria based on the idea that every architecture is expected to meet
      a specified set of goals. We start with a discussion of the meaning of \u201carchitecture\u201d,
      then discuss the goals of an architect, proceed to what\u2019s needed to achieve
      those goals, describe ways of documenting architectural design decisions, and
      finally discuss how to determine how well the design goals have been met for
      any given architecture. 1 An Analogy: Traditional Architecture When buildings
      are designed, constructed, or renovated, key designers, designated as \u201carchitects\u201d,
      have a broad range of responsibilities. An architect prepares initial sketches
      of the building, showing both external appearance and internal layout, and discusses
      these sketches with clients until all concerned have agreed that what is shown
      is what they want. The sketches are abstractions; they omit many details of
      the building. After the clients and architects agree on these abstractions,
      the architects prepare, or supervise the preparation of, much more detailed
      drawings as well as associated textual specifications. These drawings and specifications
      describe many \u201cnitty gritty\u201d details of a building, such as plumbing,
      siding materials, window glazing, electrical wiring, etc. On rare occasions
      an architect simply hands the detailed plans to a builder who completes the
      project in accordance with the plans. For more important projects, the architect
      remains involved, regularly inspects the work, and may propose changes or accept
      suggestions for change from builder and customer. When the architect supervises
      the project, it is not considered complete until the architect certifies that
      it is in substantial compliance with the plans and specifications. We employ
      architect(s) to assure that the design (1) meets the needs of the client, (2)
      has conceptual integrity, i.e. that the same design rules are used throughout,
      and (3) meets legal and safety requirements. An important part of the architect\u2019s
      role is to insure that the design concepts are consistently realised during
      the implementation. Sometimes, the architect also acts as a mediator between
      builder and client. It is important to note that a building architect is concerned
      with far more than the facade of the building and that the architect\u2019s
      decisions constrain the builders. However, it is even more important to note
      that the architect does not make all of the design decisions. The architect
      specifies certain essential properties of the design, but project supervisors,
      carpenters and others often have to make further decisions while completing
      the construction. There is often some disagreement about which decisions are
      in the realm of the architect and which are left to others, but it is always
      clear that the architect makes the major decisions, including all that can affect
      the usability, safety, and maintainability of the structure.", "venue": "",

      "title": "Inspection Procedures for Critical Programs that Model Physical Phenomena",
      "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of assuring the accuracy and trustworthiness
      of computer programs that are based on models of physical phenomena. It begins
      by explaining why such programs can be critical to safety, health, and property.
      After a quick review of what is known about software inspection, it presents
      a classification of the possible sources of error in these programs. Subsequently,
      the paper outlines an inspection procedure that would find these errors. The
      final section of the paper illustrates the concepts using a simple example,
      a program that might be used to predict contaminant diffusion. I When is software
      critical? The software that controls a nuclear plant, chemical plant, automobile,
      or airplane is obviously critical to the safety of the equipment and people
      near it. Clearly, software used for monitoring ongoing processes, e.g. for observing
      the level of contaminants, can also be relevant to safety. It is not as obvious,
      but it is equally true, that software used to model complex physical phenomena
      during the design or analysis of products and plants may also be critical for
      both safety and property protection. If the computer programs, which are used
      to predict what will happen after the plant or product is put into service,
      produce results that are not correct the consequence could be a failure that
      leads to loss-of-life and/or environmental damage. Software that controls systems
      in \u201creal-time\u201d has long been a concern in the software engineering
      research community; there has been a great deal of research work on the inspection
      or formal verification of that software [e.g. 23, 24]. However, the software
      used in the design and analysis of products and installations during the design
      phase, has not received the same attention. Software is often used in many critical
      analyses, such as \u2022 to predict the effect of explosions, \u2022 to estimate
      radioactive contaminant diffusion, \u2022 to calculate the effects of chemical
      transport in atmosphere and water bodies, and \u2022 to estimate the dispersal
      of heated water into natural reservoirs. It is often assumed that the engineers
      who use such scientific software can check the results before they use them.
      This assumption is false. If it takes a computer to perform the analysis, it
      will be difficult for any engineer or scientist to perform anything more than
      crude limiting case checks on the results. Further, we all get into the (bad)
      habit of trusting the results our computers give us. Subtle, but important,
      errors may remain undetected. Systematic methods of inspecting and certifying
      the behaviour of software for these applications would be very useful. II Software
      quality assurance: the state of the art Few people in the software industry
      like to talk to the public about the problem, but almost all the software in
      use today contains serious errors, euphemistically called \u201cbugs\u201d.
      Errors are always present", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 29,

      "title": "Inside risks: Learning from experience", "abstract": "Despite a half-century
      of practice, a distressingly large portion of today\u2019s software is over
      budget, behind schedule, bloated, and buggy. As you know, all four factors generate
      risks, and bugs can be life-critical. Our reach continues to exceed our grasp.
      While hardware has grown following Moore\u2019s Law, software seems to be stuck
      with Gresham\u2019s Law. Most providers studiously avoid taking any responsibility
      for the software they produce. These observations are not new. They were eloquently
      presented at the famous 1968 NATO conference for which the term \u201csoftware
      engineering\u201d was coined. 1 But many of today\u2019s programmers and managers
      were not even born in 1968, and most of them probably got their training after
      the conference proceedings went out of print. For those who care about software,
      wonder why it\u2019s in such bad shape, and want to do something about it, I
      prescribe the study of both the current literature and the classics. It is not
      enough to learn from your own experience; you should learn from the experiences
      of others: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat
      it.\u201d I have long recommended the book The Mythical Man-Month (Frederick
      P. Brooks, Jr., Addison-Wesley, 1995). It is a product of both bitter experience
      (\u201cIt is a very humbling experience to make a multimilliondollar mistake\u201d)
      and careful reflection on that experience. It distills much of what was learned
      about management in the first quarter-century of software development. This
      book has stayed continuously in print since 1975, with a new edition in 1995.
      It is still remarkably relevant to managing software development. Now there
      is another book I would put beside it as a useful source of time-tested advice.
      Software Fundamentals: Collected Papers by David L. Parnas (M. Hoffman and D.M.
      Weiss, Eds., Addison-Wesley, 2001) is more technical and less managementoriented,
      but equally thought-provoking. In one volume, it covers many risks-oriented
      topics. Parnas has been writing seminal and provocative articles about software
      and its development for more than 30 years, based on original research, observation,
      and diligent efforts to put theory into practice, often in risky systems such
      as avionics and nuclear reactor control. Software Fundamentals collects 33 of
      Parnas\u2019s articles, selected for their enduring messages. It includes such
      classics as \u201cOn the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules\u201d;
      \u201cOn the Design and Development of Program Families\u201d; \u201cDesigning
      Software for Ease of Extension and Contraction\u201d; \u201cA Rational Design
      Process: How and Why to Fake It\u201d; and \u201cSoftware Engineering: An Unconsummated
      Marriage.\u201d It also has some lesserknown gems, such as \u201cActive Design
      Reviews: Principles and Practices\u201d and \u201cSoftware Aging.\u201d Even
      if you remember these articles, it is worth refreshing your memory. The articles
      were written to stand alone. Each has a new introduction, discussing its historical
      and modern relevance. Thus, readers can browse the papers in just about any
      order, choosing those that catch their interest. However, this is a book where
      browsing can easily turn to serious study; the editors\u2019 arrangement provides
      an orderly sequence for reading. Whether browsing or studying this book, you\u2019ll
      be struck by how much of today\u2019s \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d about
      software was introduced (or championed very early) by Parnas. Equally surprising
      is the number of his good ideas that still have not made their way into current
      practice. Anyone who cares about software and risks should ask, Why? Parnas
      is never dull. You won\u2019t agree with everything he says, and he\u2019d probably
      be disappointed if you did. Pick something he says with which you disagree (preferably
      something you think is \u201cobviously wrong\u2019\u2019), and try to construct
      a convincing theoretical or practical counterargument. You\u2019ll probably
      find it more difficult than you expect, and you\u2019ll almost surely learn
      something worthwhile when you discover the source of your disagreement. Then,
      pick one of Parnas\u2019s good ideas that isn\u2019t being used where you work,
      and try to figure out why it isn\u2019t. That could inspire you to write a new
      column.", "venue": "CACM", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

      "Component-Oriented Software Technology started to emerge during the last few

      "title": "Deriving real-time monitors from system requirements documentation",
      "abstract": "During system testing, determining if the observed behaviour of
      a real\u2013time system is consistent with its requirements specification can
      be difficult. I propose that a system to check the behaviour against the specification,
      a monitor, be automatically derived from the requirements documentation. The
      monitor would model the system requirements as a modified finite state automaton
      in which the states represent equivalence classes of system histories and transitions
      are labelled with predicates such that it accepts only executions representing
      acceptable system behaviour. Investigation into the design of such a monitor,
      and the process for automatically generating it from reviewable requirements
      documentation is on\u2013going. 1. Problem Statement The process of testing
      a real\u2013time system typically involves running the system in a test environment,
      observing its behaviour and comparing it to that required by its specification.
      In general, making this comparison can be quite difficult since the requirements
      may be complex, possibly including time constraints and interdependencies. A
      monitor is a system that automatically determines if the observed behaviour
      is consistent with a given specification. When designing safety\u2013 or mission\u2013critical
      systems, good engineering practice dictates that a clear, precise and unambiguous
      specification of the required behaviour of the system be produced and reviewed
      for correctness by experts in the domain of application of the system. Research
      has demonstrated that such reviews are effective if the system behavioural requirements
      documentation is written such that: it expresses the required behaviour in terms
      of the quantities from the environment that are monitored and/or controlled
      by the system, it uses terminology and notation that is familiar to, or easily
      understood by, the domain experts, and it is presented in a manner that permits
      independent review of small parts of the document.[5] As discussed in [4], [9],
      [12] and [13], a (relational) system requirements document describes a relation,
      REQ, on vector functions of time representing the environmental quantities that
      are monitored and controlled by the system. I intend to explore techniques for
      using reviewable forms of such documentation (i.e. satisfying the above three
      criteria) to generate a software monitor that will determine if the observed
      behaviour of some software is consistent with that expressed in the documentation.
      Such a monitor would be useful, during system testing, for determining if the
      system is operating correctly, or, in certain safety\u2013critical applications,
      it may be useful as a redundant monitoring system during operation. Through
      this research I hope to answer the following questions: 1. How can a monitor
      be used to verify conformance with relational requirements documentation? 2.
      What are the useful classes of behavioural properties that can and cannot be:
      a) specified in relational documentation? b) verified using a monitor as described
      above? 3. Under what conditions can an effective monitor be produced automatically
      from a relational requirements document? What restrictions on the form or content
      of the documentation must be imposed? 4. What is the cost (computational and
      space complexity) of using such a monitor? Are there some optimizations that
      can be done to reduce this complexity or restrictions on the documentation that
      will ensure that the complexity is tractable?", "venue": "", "year": 2000, "referenceCount":

      "title": "On Documenting the Requirements for Computer Programs Based on Models
      of Physical Phenomena", "abstract": "Programs for use by Scientists and Engineers
      are usually embodiments of mathematical models of physical phenomena. Complete
      and accurate models are usually quite complex because they must deal with the
      wide-variety of situations that can arise in the real-world. Informal descriptions
      of these models are often incomplete, imprecise, and, inaccurate and are not
      suitable for specifying what is required of a software package. This paper presents
      an approach to writing requirements documents for such programs. It demonstrates
      how tabular notation can make precise mathematical expressions more readable.
      It also shows how we can document systems in which the user is given some control
      of the computational method to be used. 1 Why do we need a better design process
      for software that models physical phenomena? For many decades computers have
      been used to predict the behaviour of physical systems by using software that
      implements mathematical models of physical processes. These predictions can
      be very important as they are often used in the design of critical structures
      and systems, evaluating environmental impact, or controlling potentially dangerous
      processes. Unfortunately, often the predictions are wrong because the software
      is not an accurate implementation of the model of the physical phenomena. Errors
      in the software are often quite hard to detect because the underlying model
      may not be accurately and completely described; the software is quite complex
      and differences between the intended model and the actual one may be quite subtle
      [11]. This paper is part of an ongoing effort to develop methods and notations
      that improve the quality of software and reduce the number of errors made in
      its development. The most effective way to avoid faults during a system\u2019s
      operation is to eliminate or reduce errors during the initial design and early
      development phases. It is much more difficult to correct those errors later,
      when the design has progressed and the complexity has increased. Although there
      have been some successes in solving complex engineering and scientific problems
      using computer systems, the usual process of designing software appears quite
      irrational to many observers. Programmers usually start working without a clear
      statement of the desired behaviour and implementation constraints and often
      solve the wrong problem. Ideally, we would derive computer programs from a statement
      of requirements in the same way that theorems are derived from axioms in mathematical
      proofs. Probably, we\u2019ll never see a software project that proceeds in such
      a perfectly \u201crational\u201d way. Parnas and Clements [16] discussed at
      least seven reasons why that would be hard to achieve. However, precisely documenting
      the requirements can improve the software design process in many applications.
      Without a proper requirements document, we may end up with a good solution to
      the wrong problem. Program developers are also quite likely to overlook important
      special cases or even to invest effort in modelling situations that are not
      important. 2 Why do we need a relational model of documentation? A significant
      portion of most software development efforts is devoted to documentation [1,
      14]. In addition to improving program quality, good documentation improves software
      usability and maintainabiltiy; these are very important for reducing long-term
      software related expenses.", "venue": "", "year": 2000, "referenceCount": 22,

      to the licensing of drivers at this time because ACM believes that it is premature
      and would not be effective at addressing the problems of safety. * ACM is, however,
      committed to solving the car safety problem by promoting R&D, by developing
      a core hody of knowledge for drivers, and by identifying standards for driving.
      * When requested, ACM may advise state boards and other agencies interested
      in the l icensing of drivers on the state of the body of knowledge and best
      practices for vehicle operation. Such interaction will not imply ACM\u2019s

      the ACM Council firmly believes that 11 is inaccurate to convey to the public

      "title": "Requirements-based monitors for real-time systems", "abstract": "Before
      designing safety- or mission-critical real-time systems, a specification of
      the required behaviour of the system should be produced and reviewed by domain
      experts. After the system has been implemented, it should be thoroughly tested
      to ensure that it behaves correctly. This is best done using a monitor, a system
      that observes the behaviour of a target system and reports if that behaviour
      is consistent with the requirements. Such a monitor can be used both as an oracle
      during testing and as a supervisor during operation. Monitors should be based
      on the documented requirements of the system.\nIf the target system is required
      to monitor or control real-valued quantities, then the requirements, which are
      expressed in terms of the monitored and controlled quantities, will allow a
      range of behaviours to account for errors and imprecision in observation and
      control of these quantities. Even if the controlled variables are discrete valued,
      the requirements must specify the timing tolerance. Because of the limitations
      of the devices used by the monitor to observe the environmental quantities,
      there is unavoidable potential for false reports, both negative and positive.\nThis
      paper discusses design of monitors for real-time systems, and examines the conditions
      under which a monitor will produce false reports. We describe the conclusions
      that can be drawn when using a monitor to observe system behaviour.", "venue":

      may want to consider the following statements: All Engineers use mathematics

      should we conclude from these \"axioms\"? Some would conclude that Software
      Engineers are not Engineers. Others would conclude that the first statement
      must be incorrect and should read, \"All Engineers except Software Engineers

      much of the mathematics developed by Computer Scientists is not very practical,

      "title": "Inside risks: ten myths about Y2K inspections", "abstract": "It is
      computer science \u201cfolk wisdom\u201d that our computer systems, particularly
      the networks, are unnecessarily vulnerable because so many of our systems are
      either made by Microsoft, highly dependent on Microsoft software, or required
      to interact with Microsoft software. Many see this as a single point of failure,
      an Achilles\u2019 heel. Analogies are drawn to situations such as many people
      concentrated in a dangerous area, large quantities of hazardous materials stored
      in one place, or systems reliant on a single power source. Many propose that
      we can decrease our vulnerability by insisting on the use of non-Windows operating
      systems\u2014thereby increasing diversity. In this column, I question that view.
      Diversity, when combined with redundancy, is a well-established approach to
      increasing the reliability of safety-critical systems. For example, having two
      independent pumps, either of which is adequate, may decrease the probability
      of a complete outage; using two pumps of diverse manufacture may make it less
      likely that both fail at once. Predictions that diversity will increase reliability
      assume: \u2022 Redundancy: The system must be functional even if one pump fails.
      \u2022 Independence: The failure of one pump must not make the failure of the
      other more likely, and the pumps must not depend on shared resources. \u2022
      Deep diversity: The pumps must be fundamentally different so that they are unlikely
      to have common design faults. \u2022 Interoperability: The pumps must function
      well together. If not, the number of failures may increase. The validity of
      these assumptions must be carefully examined in each individual situation; they
      do not seem to apply to today\u2019s computer systems. That increasing diversity
      does not always improve reliability is obvious if we think of automobile traffic.
      We would not make our roads safer by demanding that 30% of us switch to the
      other side of the road. On the roads there is limited redundancy and independence.
      All drivers are essential; a failure of one affects many others. Further, cars
      driven with different rules would not be interoperable. Examining the case at
      hand we see: \u2022 In today\u2019s computer systems, there is remarkably little
      redundancy. When a Canadian tax system failed, no tax returns could be submitted.
      Basing the Irish system on a different OS would not have helped. Having two
      diverse Canadian systems would help only if they implemented exactly the same
      rules. \u2022 In today\u2019s OS market, diversity is shallow. Linux, and the
      various Unix versions are very much alike and Apple has joined this club. More
      subtly, studying Windows and the Unix family, one will see that the developers
      have all \u201clearned from\u201d each other or from common sources. More generally,
      programmers often overlook the same situations and write diverse programs that
      fail on the same cases. Independence is equally questionable. Two communicating
      systems constitute a single system. A failure of one can cause problems for
      the other. Frequently, networks stop while all the elements patiently wait for
      one to finish. One false message can trigger a cavalcade of failures. \u2022
      Interoperability of independently developed software systems is very difficult
      to achieve. Communication protocols that are \u201calmost alike\u201d often
      fail to work together. Many experienced IT managers wisely insist on a monoculture
      in their networks because they fear incompatibility and cannot deal with the
      finger pointing that occurs when one supplier\u2019s system does not work well
      with another. If one product is updated to remove a fault (or feature) on which
      another depends, the combined system fails and it is not clear who should fix
      it. Were we to insist on a diverse mix of operating systems, their failure to
      work together properly could actually reduce reliability and increase vulnerability.
      In some cases, the whole system would be no more reliable than its weakest link.
      When I buy a light bulb, tire, or car, I benefit from competition and limited
      diversity because there are tight standards that allow me to replace one brand
      with another. We do not have comparable standards for operating systems. Each
      upgrade causes some trouble in application software. This column is neither
      pro-monopoly nor proMicrosoft. It is pro-realism. If we want the advantages
      of diversity and competition in support software, there is much difficult work
      to do. We need precise specifications for systems that are to operate in our
      networks; we also need the ability to enforce those standards. Otherwise, increasing
      diversity might make the situation worse.", "venue": "CACM", "year": 1999, "referenceCount":

      "|This paper addresses one of the perpetual questions faced by software developers,
      \\How much testing is enough testing?\". Software testing accounts for a substantial
      portion of software development costs, but releasing software with unacceptable
      reliability is also very costly. We begin with a discussion of how classical
      notions of reliability can be applied to deterministic software and explain
      that the reliability of a software is as much a function of the way that it
      is used as of quality of the software. We then illustrate how simple operational
      pro les can be used to characterize usage patterns. Finally, we show how the
      reliability requirements can be used to determine how much testing is necessary
      and whether or not the software is acceptable. Using the method of inverse sampling,
      also called negative binomial sampling, we develop an e cient statistical procedure
      for quantifying the reliability of a piece of software. The procedure allows
      substantial reductions in the average number of executions run over the traditional
      binomial testing. Other issues such as the calculation of upper con dence bounds
      for software failure rate under both binomial and negative binomial sampling
      are also addressed. The results obtained are illustrated numerically and graphically
      on several cases arising in practice. Some issues for further work, namely the
      use of sequential testing, the computer implementation of the methods developed
      and the testing of continuously-run software, are also discussed. Index Terms|Average

      on newly invented, often poorly understood, notations and concepts, Harlan Mills
      was always careful to build his ideas on solidly understood mathematical concepts,
      concepts whose correctness was never in doubt. In a field where we are forced
      to deal with a variety of poorly designed programming notations, Harlan Mills
      was careful enough to formulate his ideas in ways that were independent of notation
      and hence applicable with a wide variety of notations.Harlan Mills'' observation
      that the behavior of a deterministic program could be described by a function
      whose range and domain were sets of program states is typical of his contributions.
      He expressed the laws of programs by showing that they were the well-known laws
      of functions. His descriptions of how the function describing the behavior of
      a constructed program can be determined from the functions describing its components
      are valid for any imperative programming language.Building on this solid foundation,
      the Software Engineering Research Group at McMaster has been able to develop
      practical notations that can be used with many languages. We can extend the
      notation and apply it without moving away from the solid foundation that Harlan
      Mills constructed. The talk will describe how tabular notations are based on

      Taking Stock of Software Engineering Research and Education What do we know?
      What should we know?", "abstract": "Preface Software Engineering should address,
      and solve, existing problems. Software Engineering as a branch of computer science
      emerged from discussions and conferences in the late sixties. Its goal was to
      apply knowledge and techniques from traditional engineering to the construction
      and maintenance of software. Now, as the end of the century draws near, many
      people apply concepts, techniques, and notations created in, and around, the
      field of software engineering. But we are far away from a common understanding
      of what the important problems are and which approaches are appropriate. We
      have many conferences and magazines of questionable value, and little agreement
      about what should be taught in universities and which topics should be further
      investigated. This workshop attempts to reach an agreement about these questions,
      for those who participate, but hopefully also with some effect on our colleagues
      who don''t. By discussing our ability to solve those problems which actually
      occur in software engineering, we hope to identify what should be in the curriculum
      and in the research agenda. Introduction This report is the result of a very
      intensive five-day workshop at Dagstuhl in February 1999. As part of the announcement
      and invitation, a list of suggested tasks was distributed; those who intended
      to participate were asked to submit a position paper on at least one of the
      subjects, and to judge the current state of all the subjects. Here is the initial

      "Software is devilishly hard to inspect. Serious errors can hide for years.
      Consequently, many are hesitant to employ software in safety-critical applications
      and all companies are finding the cost of correcting and improving software
      to be an increasing burden.This talk describes a procedure for inspecting software
      that consistently finds subtle errors in software that was believed to be correct.
      The procedure is based on four key ideas: All software reviewers actively use
      the code Reviewers exploit the hierarchical structure of the code rather than
      proceeding sequentially through the code Reviewers focus on small sections of
      code, producing precise summaries that are used when inspecting other such sections
      Reviewers proceed systematically so that no case, and no section of the program,
      gets overlookedDuring the procedure, the inspectors produce and review precise
      documentation. They are able to check for complete coverage; tabular notation
      allows the work to proceed in small systematic steps. The procedure was originally
      developed and used to inspect safety-critical software in a nuclear power plant,
      and then improved based on that experience.", "venue": "International Conference

      prepare this biography, I took the occasion to review my life and realized that
      I have spent it unable to decide whether to be a scientist or an engineer and
      whether to be in academia or industry. As a student at the Bronx High School
      of Science in New York, I was clearly on the engineering side. I found both
      challenge and satisfaction in making calculations that could be tested against
      reality by building a device. I wasn''t satisfied with having something rigkt
      ''fin theory;\" I wanted to see it work. I loved designing, building, and testing
      electronic equipment, obtained a government license as a \"Radio Engineer,\"
      and later worked in rac,io ,~ations. In 1957 1 entered a1~ engineering school,
      Carnegie Institute of Technology, but chose to study science (physics); I thought
      that studying science would be the way to learn the truth about the universe.
      Two years later I realized that the truth being sought by rr:y teachers was
      an extra decimal place of precision in the estimated weight of electrons. I
      was left cold by discussions of un~estable, or difficult to test, theories.
      I was lured to Engineering by a teacher, Everard M. Williams, who convinced
      me that by .,~aying that the greatest challenge in the world was solving real
      problems. I received my undergraduate degree in Electrica:~ Engineering in 1961.
      Even before I grmtuated, I was allowed to teach an introductory EE course and
      discovered the joy, indeed the thrill, of teaching engineering. However, teaching
      engineering convinced me that the real problem was that my students did not
      understand how to use mathematics. In yet another sign of indecision, I asked
      ~o teach a mathematics course. I enjoyed the experience, and v~:ote a novel
      textbook, but lost interest after a major publisher offered to publish it. After
      obtaining m:~ e:agineering degree, I once again found myself attracted b3 t:ae
      idea of searching for simple truths and began my graduate studies in mathematics
      at the University of Michigar. This time, I learned more quickly; after one
      semester, I returned to Carnegie Tech, and engineering. Mathematics was indeed
      beautiful, but somehow too simple. I enjoyed its internal logic, but missed
      designing and testing the results against reality. In mathematics, the researchers
      make up all the rules; in engineering we must observe and exploit the natural
      laws of the universe. It was while teaching a course in \u2026", "venue": "SOEN",

      S. Easterbrook and J. Callahan. Formal methods for veriication and validation
      of partial speciica-tions: A case study. The SCR methods and tools are usable
      by people other than the SCR developers. In the case of both the NASA space
      system application and Rockwell''s ight guidance system, people outside our
      group were able to use the SCR technology to do productive w ork. Use of the
      SCR notation and tools can facilitate the use of more heavy-duty techniques.
      Deductive reasoning , and mechanical provers that support such reasoning, can
      be easily applied to SCR speciica-tions. As noted above, we recently used a
      system called TAME to analyze an SCR speciication using deductive reasoning
      and the PVS prover. Unlike many other formal methods, the SCR tools provide
      feedback in terms understandable to users. Listed below are several planned
      follow-on tasks involving the WCP and its software requirements: Translate the
      remaining ve safety properties into logical formulas and apply our abstraction
      coupled with model checking and simulation to determine whether the SCR speciication
      of the WCP satisses the other ve properties. Study the desirability and feasibility
      of using the logic equations as a notation supported by the SCR tools. Translating
      the logic equations into the SCR semantics should be easy. The diiculty lies
      in providing user feedback in terms of logic equations, rather than tables,
      when the tool detects an error. Study the feasibility of developing a more standard
      SCR speciication from the SRS for the WCP. This SCR speciication would represent
      the requirements in terms of SCR mode classes and eliminate some remaining redundancy
      in the current SRS. It would also provide a good example of an SRS that was
      developed directly using our tools. Organize the SCR speciication of the WCP
      for ease of change. Due to the large numb e r o f v ari-ables it contains, the
      current SCR speciication of the WCP is quite diicult to understand. A carefully
      thought-out reorganization of the speciication should make the speciication
      not only more understandable but also easier to modify. An important remaining
      question is how to transfer formal methods technology, such as the SCR technology,
      into industry. Currently, contractors have little economic incentive to apply
      formal methods during the requirements phase. Hence, government program managers
      must provide that incentive. They can do so by writing contracts that require
      developers to demonstrate before the software is designed that the behavior

      a program, it is a sign that something is not understood\u201d[2]. On hearing
      of this statement W. Bartussek responded with, \u201cYes, a picture is what
      you draw when you are trying to understand something or trying to help someone
      understand it\u201d[1]. These two, superficially equivalent, statements demonstrate
      the broad range of opinions among programming experts about pictures of programs.
      The following opinions are, in our opinion, all accurate and relevant. \u2022
      Pictures clearly do help people to get an understanding of the basic structure

      "title": "Teaching For Change", "abstract": "A perennial concern of those who
      teach about computers is the rapid change that we see in our field. The hardware
      and software that dominated the field just four years ago are not even considered
      interesting today. When we think about our students, we must wonder how we can
      teach anything that will be relevant when they graduate or five years later.
      While the pace of change in computing is unprecedented, the problem of teaching
      engineers in rapidly changing fields is not. When I received my electrical engineering
      education in the late 60\u2019s, my teachers were as concerned about rapid change
      as we are today. When I entered engineering, the \u201creal world\u201d was
      vacuum tubes, and some people told me that semiconductor physics was \u201cuseless
      theory.\u201d The wise members of the faculty recognized that what we taught
      had to be useful now, as well as in the future. Today, teaching in an engineering
      environment once again (after a hiatus of two decades) I can see the wisdom
      of their choices. The engineering books on my shelves, purchased in the late
      50\u2019s, are still true and relevant. In contrast, most of the computer books
      on my shelves dated in the 80\u2019s, are out of date, irrelevant, archaic,
      and in many cases, obviously wrong. Things have changed quickly in both areas,
      but what I learned two decades ago was fundamental and has remained important.
      As long as I have been observing computer science education, there has been
      concern about keeping up-to-date. The ACM curriculum recommendations are frequently
      updated and conference discussions are full of the latest buzzwords and references
      to the latest research papers. The engineering education tradition, however,
      is different: it stressed focusing on fundamentals and avoiding fads. In contrast,
      currently, \u201cteaching new research results\u201d is a scathingly negative
      comment in all but the most advanced undergraduate engineering courses. In this
      talk, I will propose and defend a list of fundamental concepts that should be
      taught in software engineering courses. I will argue that only by not teaching
      the latest fads, can we give our students an education that will stand them
      in good stead a decade or two from now. Proceedings of the 10th Conference on

      "abstract": "Those who do not use \"formal methods\" for developing software
      (and they remain the overwhelming majority of software developers) often claim
      that mathematical software development can only be used by highly educated people,
      and on especially well-written programs. We counter this claim by reporting
      on some recent experience. An undergraduate engineering student who had no previous
      exposure to mathematical software documentation techniques was asked to use
      a new method to document a program that had been written for photonics and microwave
      development, but did not always work as required; the author had departed and
      the program''s owners were not able to find the problem. The student was not
      asked to change the program, just to provide precise documentation. However,
      the process of documentation revealed several errors and, after they were corrected,
      the program was left in working, and maintainable condition. Our experience
      supports the position of those who believe that mathematical methods can be
      used by typical engineers with immediate benefits.", "venue": "COMPASS ''95

      a new form of program documentation that is precise, systematic and readable.
      This documentation comprises a set of displays supplemented by a lexicon and

      can be examined without looking at any other display. Each display has three
      parts: (1) the specification of the program presented in the display, (2) the
      program itself, and (3) the specifications of programs invoked by this program.
      The displays are intended to be used by software engineers as a reference document
      during inspection and maintenance. This paper also introduces a specification
      technique that is a refinement of H.D. Mills''s (1975) functional approach to
      program documentation and verification; programs are specified and described

      "title": "Generating a test oracle from program documentation: work in progress",
      "abstract": "A fundamental assumption of software testing is that there is some
      mechanism, an oracle, that will determine whether or not the results of a test
      execution are correct. In practice this is often done by comparing the output,
      either automatically or manually, to some pre-calculated, presumably correct,
      output [17]. However, if the program is formally documented it is possible to
      use the specification to determine the success or failure of a test execution,
      as in [1], for example. This paper discusses ongoing work to produce a tool
      that will generate a test oracle from formal program documentation.\nIn [9],
      [10] and [11] Parnas et al. advocate the use of a relational model for documenting
      the intended behaviour of programs. In this method, tabular expressions are
      used to improve readability so that formal documentation can replace conventional
      documentation. Relations are described by giving their characteristic predicate
      in terms of the values of concrete program variables. This documentation method
      has the advantage that the characteristic predicate can be used as the test
      oracle -- it simply must be evaluated for each test execution (input & output)
      to assign pass or fail. In contrast to [1], this paper discusses the testing
      of individual programs, not objects as used in [1]. Consequently, the method
      works with program documentation, written in terms of the concrete variables,
      and no representation function need be supplied. Documentation in this form,
      and the corresponding oracle, are illustrated by an example.\nFinally, some
      of the implications of generating test oracles from relational specifications
      are discussed.", "venue": "International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis",

      "title": "Assessment of safety-critical software in nuclear power plants", "abstract":
      "This article outlines an approach in the design, documentation, and evaluation
      of computer systems. This allows the use of software in many safety-critical
      applications because it enables the systematic comparison of the program behavior
      with the engineering specifications of the computer system. Many of the ideas
      in this article have been used by the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada
      in its safety assessment of the software for the shutdown systems of the Darlington
      Station. The four main elements of this approach follow: (1) Formal Documentation
      of Software Requirements: Most of the details of a complex environment can be
      ignored by system implementers and reviewers if they are given a complete and
      precise statement of the behavioral requirements for the computer system. We
      describe five mathematical relations that specify the requirements for the software
      in a computerized control system. (2) Design and Documentation of the Module
      Structure: Complexity caused by interactions between separately written components
      can be reduced by applying Data Abstraction, Abstract Data Types, and Object-Oriented
      Programming if the interfaces are precisely and completely documented. (3) Program
      Function Documentation: Software executions are lengthy sequences of state changes
      described by algorithms. The effects of these executive sequences can be preciselymore\u00a0\u00bb
      specified documented with tabular presentations of the program functions. Also,
      large programs can be decomposed and presented at a collection of well-documented
      smaller programs. (4) Tripod Approach to Assessment: There are three basic approaches
      to the assessment of complex software products: (i) testing, (ii) systematic
      inspection, and (iii) certification of people and processes. Assessment of a
      complex system cannot depend on any one of these alone. The approach used on
      the Darlington shutdown software, which included systematic inspection as well
      as planned and statistically designed random testing, is outlined.\u00ab\u00a0less",

      "title": "On iterative constructs", "abstract": "The wheel is repeatedly reinvented
      because it is a good idea. Perhaps Anson''s \"A Generalized Iterative Construct
      and Its Semantics\" [1] confirms that \u201cA Generalized Control Structure
      and Its Formal Definition\u201d [2], and the earlier \u201cAn Alternative Control
      Structure and its Formal Definition\u201d [3] presented good ideas. However,
      there are several misstatements in [1] that should be corrected.\nAs Anson points
      out, [2] contained definitions of constructs equivalent to both DO TERM and
      DO UPON. However, he is incorrect when he suggests that it emphasized DO TERM
      because of efficiency considerations. By writing \u201cThere is a pragmatic
      justification for either definition! \u201c, I made it clear that that was not
      the reason for my choice. DO TERM has two, quite different, advantages.\n(a)
      DO TERM is more general. An implementation of DO TERM may, in fact, be DO UPON
      if desired. Further, a programmer using DO TERM can achieve the effects of DO
      UPON by choosing his guards accordingly.\n(b) DO TERM, like Dijkstra''s do od,
      eases the verification of programs by maintaining independence of guarded commands.
      The verification procedure for such constructs as do od and DO TERM is (1) verify
      that the union of the guards is true in all states where the program will be
      invoked; (2) verify that each guarded command, on its own, will do no wrong.
      For DO UPON the second step is complicated by the need to consider the terminating
      commands in the list when considering an iterating command.\nAnson argues that
      the semantics of DO TERM are more complex. The minor syntactic difference between
      his two definitions is a consequence of the clumsiness of wp semantics. In the
      relational semantics used in [2], the change from DO UPON to DO TERM meant the
      addition of one simple definition.\nAs Mills'' [4] has explained, programmers
      should not be deriving the semantics of their programs from the text as Anson''s
      analysis suggests. We do not write programs arbitrarily and then try to determine
      their semantics. Instead, programmers should be verifying that the program they
      have written has the semantics that they set out to achieve. Fortunately, this
      verification is much easier than the inductive derivation of semantics described
      in [1]. As explained above, verification is easier for DO TERM than DO UPON.\nAnson
      suggests that a stronger weakest-precondition \u201cseems to imply a weaker
      construct.\u201d On the contrary, DO TERM can describe algorithms that cannot
      be described with DO UPON.\nAnson also suggests that in DO TERM termination
      is more difficult to obtain. Programmers can obtain the behavior that they want
      in either. With DO TERM the guards may be longer. For those that want to reduce
      the length of the guards, [2] offered a third alternative, a deterministic construct.
      This construct forced left-to-right consideration of the commands. This alternative
      has the verification disadvantages of DO UPON (the guarded command semantics
      are not independent), but, by putting the terminating commands first, one can
      achieve everything that Anson values in DO UPON. In fact, with the deterministic
      construct, one can often achieve guards that are shorter than they would be
      with DO UPON. DO UPON seems to be a compromise between DO TERM and the deterministic
      construct, a compromise with some of the disadvantages of both extremes and
      the advantages of neither.\nAnson has not provided the full semantics of the
      constructs in question. It has been known for many years (e.g., Majster [5])
      that wp alone does not define the semantics of a program. Two programs with
      the same wp can differ in their behavior in important ways. To provide a complete
      semantics of the constructs one must define both wp and wlp. That was one of
      the reasons for using a relational semantics in [2] and [3]. When I wrote [2]
      I deliberately chose DO TERM over DO UPON because I felt that the simplicity
      of verification compensated for the longer guards. I also valued the ability
      to describe the algorithms that cannot be described with DO UPON. I continue
      to prefer the syntax used in [2]. I believe that readers who consider the facts
      above will make the same choice.\nThe discussion of these issues is made a bit
      academic by the four-year delay between Anson''s submission of his paper (which
      apparently coincided with the publication of [2]) and the publication of [1].
      In that time a generalization of both schemes has been published as a Technical
      Report [6] and has been submitted for publication. In this generalization the
      decision about whether a command is iterating or terminating can be made during
      execution, and the semantics must be that of DO TERM. Further generalizations
      make the seman tics of the constructs more practical, since side-effects are
      accurately treated in all cases. A method for reducing the length of guards
      and avoiding duplicated subexpressions is also provided.", "venue": "TOPL",

      "AbstractIt can be said that the most promising field within computer science
      is Artificial Intelligence, often simply known as AI. Some will interpret this
      as meaning that AI is a field that holds great promise. Others interpret this
      as meaning that AI is a field whose practitioners make great promises. Recently
      conferences, journals and newspapers articles have contained suggestions that
      AI offers special new techniques that can make drastic changes in the role of
      computer systems in the v/orld.This paper presents a more skeptical view. It
      argues that (a) the terminology used in many AI discussions is poor, (b) that
      many techniques widely touted as revolutionary are ad hoc, \u201ccut and try,\u201d
      methods that will not lead to trustworthy products, (c) that many claims about
      AI and expert systems are exaggerated, and (d) that the fundamental research
      is more philosophical than practical. Most important, it concludes that many
      applications being tackled using ad hoc, heuristic methods can be solved using

      1985 appointing me a member of the SDIO Panel on Computing in Support of Battle
      Management. I appreciate the recognition implicit in being chosen as one of
      your expert advisors on computer science. After attending the first meeting
      of the panel and giving the problem considerable thought, I am resigning my
      membership in the panel. I do not believe that further work by the panel will
      be useful and I cannot, in good conscience, accept further payment for useless
      effort. The panel''s work will not be useful for two reasons. 1) The goals stated
      for the Strategic Defense System cannot be attained by the class of systems
      that you are considering. 2) The SDIO is not the appropriate organization to
      fund and administer the research it is support-27 ing. Most of the money spent
      will be wasted. The panel on which you have asked me to serve, is not appropriately
      constituted, clearly chartered, and adequately informed. There are better ways
      to select and manage research. My conclusions are not based on political or
      policy judgements. Unlike many other academic critics of the SDI effort, I have
      not, in the'' past, objected to defense efforts or defense sponsored research.
      I have been deeply involved in such research and have consulted extensively
      on defense projects. My conclusions are based on more that 20 years of research
      on software engineering including more than 8 years of work on real-time software
      used in military aircraft. They are based on familiarity with both operational
      military software and computer science research. My conclusions are based on
      characteristics peculiar to this particular effort, not objections to weapons
      development in general. Before making my decision and writing this letter I
      have carefully reconsidered what I have learned in my own research area and
      I have reviewed reports of work in related fields. These reviews lead inevitably
      to the judgements stated above. I am willing to stake my professional reputation
      on my conclusions. Enclosed with this letter are brief papers (1-2 pages each)
      summarizing my observations and substantiating the conclusions stated above.
      Their purpose is to explain my decision. These papers explain : 1) The fundamental
      technological differences between software engineering and other areas of engineering
      and why software is unreliable, 2) The properties of the proposed SDI software
      that make it unattainable, 3) Why the techniques commonly used to build \u2026",

      generalization of those structures, a single statement using the new control
      structure can implement the functions of loops, conditionals, and also programs

      increased capability, it is possible to write algorithms that are simpler, more
      efficient, and more clearly correct than those that can be written with earlier
      structured-programming control structures. In order to provide a precise definition
      of the new constructs, a new version of relational semantics, called LD-relations
      is presented. An algebra of these relations is developed and used to define
      the meaning of the new constructs. A short discussion of program development

      "This paper presents an improved approach to the design of software for hard-real-time
      systems. The software for such systems is usually difficult to change because
      of constraints imposed by the need to meet absolute deadlines on processors
      with limited memory capacity. Dijkstra and others have shown that the concept
      of cooperating sequential processes can be used to improve the structure of
      software when concurrency is present. However, their techniques do not (1) deal
      with real-time deadlines, (2) are not efficient in their use of processor time
      and memory, and (3) do not allow simple efficient synchronization in the complex
      situations that arise in typical embedded systems. This paper presents a number
      of refinements to the basic concept that allow its use in hard-real-time embedded
      software. The three key ideas are, (1) a multi-level approach that allows convenient
      synchronization without a penalty in real-time response, (2) the use of a pre-run-time
      scheduler to allow more efficient use of resources, and (3) a new synchronization
      scheme that is both simple and general.", "venue": "IEEE Military Communications

      : This is the notebook from the updated edition of the well-received course
      originated by the Naval Research Laboratory and taught annually for the past
      six years. It is a two-week technical course for personnel managing a software
      project or designing software. The purpose of the course is to improve the participant''s
      ability to evaluate software requirements, specifications, design, correctness,
      and maintainability. Its purpose is not to transform the participant into an
      expert software designer. The course concentrates on technical problems of software
      design. It introduces generally accepted design practices, as well as software
      design research that may result in practical design applications in the near
      future. Design for ease of maintenance is emphasized. All course material is
      unclassified. Topics covered include information-hiding modules (modules that
      isolate the effects of changes), abstract interfaces (a technique for designing
      the interfaces of information-hiding modules), responses to undesired events,
      cooperating sequential processes (in real-time systems, software tasks in which
      scheduling and resource allocation decisions are not embedded), disciplined
      documentation techniques, techniques for formal specification, and designing
      systems with useful subsets. (Author)", "venue": "", "year": 1981, "referenceCount":

      functioning of a program. Thei r most cogent argument is that the social processes

      Dijkstra (and others) have insisted that program s are mathematical objects
      and should be treated with the sam e care and elegance that mathematicians traditionally
      give t o their products. Both sides are driven to extreme positions becaus e
      they insist on comparing programming with mathematics rathe r than with engineering.
      Engineers have long use d mathematical methods, which are analogous to progra

      These efforts are useful in spite of th e fact that the social pressures described

      written as a position paper for a panel discussion at a conference entitled
      \" Language Design for Reliable Software \". The position that it presents is
      that improvements i n software reliability are best obtained by studying software
      design not by designing new languages . 1. On\" Building In \" The title of
      this paper is ambiguous. The subjec t could be a report on the methods that
      we have use d to insure the reliability of the software in th e BLOWHARD system.
      The title could equally wel l describe a discussion of the properties of th
      e BLOWHARD language that help the BLOWHARD programmer to produce reliable programs.
      The title was chosen in order to contrast tw o alternative approaches to \"
      Language Design fo r Reliable Software \". One approach lies in the creation
      of \" sophisticated \" (i .e. \"more complex than ALGOL 60\") languages with
      many constructs that are intended to help in the process of program construction
      and verification. These are buil t in software. An alternative approach lies
      in the creatio n of extremely simple languages, languages wit h very little
      built in. It is hoped that the simplicity of the tool will contribute mor e
      to the reliability of the product than woul d the omitted features. If we are
      willing to build more in (using) the language, one can reduce the amoun t that
      must be built in (to) the language. * BLOWHARD is a new programming Language.
      It s name is an acronym : Basic Language-Omnificen t With Hardly Any Research
      or Development. Any similarity to languages living or not is purel y coincidental.
      The optimal compromise is not known. In designing BLOWHARD I have taken a rather
      extreme position. The remainder of this paper explains that position. 1. Four
      views of a Programming Languag e When listening to discussions of programming
      languages I am always reminded of the old story o f the blind men encountering
      an elephant. In my experience, there are four commonly held iiew s of programming

      Computer Systems", "abstract": "Abstract : This report describes a procedure
      for designing computer systems that are developed specifically to be a component
      of a more complex system. Two significant characteristics of such design problems
      are the following: the computer system interface is determined by factors outside
      the control of the computer system designer, and the specifications of that
      interface are likely to change throughout the life cycle of the system. The
      purpose of the procedure described in this report is to reduce maintenance costs
      by means of a software organization that insulates most of the programs from
      changes in the interface. The procedure is based on the systematic compilation
      of an assumption list. The assumption list describes those aspects of the interface
      that future users and other knowledgeable persons consider essential and therefore
      stable. Other aspects of the interface are ignored. An abstract interface is
      designed on the basis of this assumption list. A specification of the abstract
      interface is used to procure the major components of the system. This report
      explains the principles behind the procedure and illustrates its use. The success
      of the procedure is primarily limited by the ability of designers and future
      users to compile an accurate list of assumptions. A side benefit of the procedure
      is simpler, better structured software. Successful application of the procedure
      should result in both increased reliability and reduced lift-cycle costs.",

      Some of the derived theorems provide for: reconfiguration of real-time multiprogrammed
      processes, communication between functions, and prevention of data and timing
      conflicts. The rist step in defining a system with a formal methodology is to
      apply a formalized set of rules. We have found that enforcing such rules, especialy
      on a large project with many organizations, is very difficult. In fact, it is
      almost impossible without the aid of automated tools to describe the design
      process and its verification. We envision a scheme in which the definition of
      a given system can be described with an HOS specification language which, by
      its very nature, enforces the axioms with the use of each construct. A system
      dermed in HOS can be analyzed automatically for axiomatic consistency by the
      Design Analyzer without program execution, and by the Structuring Executive
      Analyzer on a real-time basis. The result is that a software system can be developed
      efficiently with reliable interfaces. This is significant since interface testing
      in a large system accounts for approximately 75 percent of the verification
      effort.'' 1Seventy-three percent of all problems found during the APOLLO integration

      paper discusses an approach to handling run-time errors in software systems.
      It is often assumed that in programs which can be proven correct, errors will
      not be a problem. This paper is predicted on the assumption that, even with
      correct programs, undesired events at run-time will continue to be a problem.
      Routines to respond to these undesired events (UEs) must be provided in reliable
      systems.\n This paper describes a program organization which aims at satisfying
      the following criteria:\n (1) UE response routines are written by each programmer
      in terms of the abstract machine which he uses for his normal case code. UEs
      are reported in those terms. He is never forced to use information about the
      implementation of other modules in the system.\n (2) Programs can be written
      so that the code for UE detection, UE correction, and normal case, are lexically
      separate and can be modified independently.\n (3) The system can evolve from
      an initial version that does little recovery to one which uses sophisticated
      recovery techniques without a change in the structure of the system.\n (4) Even
      with unsophisticated recovery procedures, the task of locating the module containing
      a bug discovered at run-time does not require internal knowledge of many modules.\n
      (5) Costs incurred because of the recovery techniques are low as no UE occurs.",

      on changes, during the compilation of a statement, in the set of associations

      modular programs, because such programs tend to require frequent switching between
      the environments associated with different modules. With current compilers,
      arbitrary switching of environments must be handled by means of macros at compile

      the relaxation of present restrictions on changes in the compile-time environment.
      Specifically, we propose that a group of declarations can be defined as an environment
      and that arbitrary pieces of program text can state within which environment
      they are to be compiled. With such a mechanism, program text can be intermixed
      by means of macros without having to make the relevant declarations global or
      having to repeat the declarations in places other than the environment''s definition.",

      paper assumes software structure to be characterized by the interfaces between
      subsystems or modules. Reliability is considered to be a measure of the extent
      to which the system can be expected to deliver usable services when those services
      are demanded. It is argued that reliability and correctness (in the sense used
      in current computer literature) are not synonyms. The differences suggest techniques
      by which the reliability of software can be improved even while the production
      of correct software remains beyond our reach. In general, the techniques involve
      considering certain unpleasant facts of life at an early stage in the design
      process, the stage where the structure is determined, rather than later. An
      appendix gives some specific examples of questions which, if they are thoughtfully
      considered early in the design, can lead to more reliable systems.", "venue":

      misleading to apply the appellation \"perma-nent blocking\" to a condition which
      under fortuitous circumstances might resolve itself. We prefer the term \"indefinite
      postponement.\" The algorithm given by Holt in the final section of his paper
      is unnecessarily cautious and is likely to delay the resolution of the \"indefinite
      postponement condition .\" There is no need to restrict granting of requests
      to the first process in the safe sequence found. Safe requests by any process
      preceding Pi in the sequence should always be granted. Certain requests may
      be granted to those after Pi in the sequence without postponing the grant for
      P~. We would like to comment on the paper by R.C. Holt [1]. In Section 2 Holt
      quotes Habermann [2] and then continues as follows: \"Habermann states, ''The
      algorithms [for deciding if a state is safe] decide only whether or not granting
      a request can produce a deadlock, so assignment rules (according to priority
      rules for instance) can be implemented freely.'' The obvious conclusion would
      seem to be that a scheduler which grants only safe requests will avoid all deadlocks
      and grant all requests.\" Holt''s \"obvious conclusion\" is quite clearly false.
      The statement is equivalent to \"a scheduler which does not grant any unsafe
      requests will eventually grant all requests.\" We do not believe that anyone
      who read the earlier article thoughtfully would reach that conclusion. The earlier
      articles [2, 3] make it clear that the notion of safe state is equivalent to
      the existence of a sequence of resource allocations and process completions
      which results in the return of all resources to the common pool. From this it
      follows that, were one to choose a scheduling policy which restricted the set
      of possible sequences to a proper subset of the set of \"safe sequences,\" we
      must not consider any state to be safe if its safety was predicted on sequences
      which are not in that subset. With this fact in mind the difficulties discussed
      in Holt''s Section 3 can be systematically avoided. Although we hate to quibble

      thesis that such information \"broadcasting is harmful, that it is helpful if

      "title": "Letters to the editor: on improving the quality of our technical meetings",
      "abstract": "Technical Meetings EDITOR : Over the relatively few years that
      I have been attending Joint Computer Conferences and ACM national conferences
      there has been an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the quality and nature
      of the average technical paper presented at those conferences. There has been
      a tendency for the \"People Who Have Real Work to Do\" (PWHRWD) members of the
      societies to blame the lack of relevance on the presence of academic interests
      while the academic interests have blamed the relatively low quality of the papers
      on the presence of the PWHRWD. Contrary to these feelings, I am certain that
      an objective analysis will show that both groups are dissatisfied and that both
      groups have contributed irrelevant and low quality papers to the conferences.
      While most of the negative comments have been made in private conversation,
      more recent conferences, especially this year''s SJCC, have seen public expressions
      of dissatisfaction from several members for whom I have the highest respect.
      In the light of this situation I would like to bring the problem into open discussion
      by reviewing several factors contributing to the situation and proposing a possible
      solution. Over the past years I have heard the following reasons suggested for
      the unsatisfactory technical meetings. 1. There are too many major conferences
      each year. 2. Many papers are written in order to generate travel money to meetings
      rather than to communicate. 3. Since the distribution of the proceedings of
      these conferences is an order of magnitude smaller than that of many major journals,
      an author with serious interest in communicating will have them as his last
      choice for any paper he writes. In this respect it is interesting to note that
      ACM conferences have generally lower attendance than the JCCs and that there
      is fairly widespread agreement that the technical papers at ACM are significantly
      poorer than those at the JCCs. Other factors, not widely discussed, are: 4.
      The building up of a good editorial staff is ~ difficult and time-consuming
      process. It requires a fair amount of experience for an editor to be able to
      select proper referees for a given paper and to know how much weight to give
      to their comments. It also requires a fair amount of experience for a referee
      to know what standards to apply to a paper and, more important, to know how
      to assist an author in producing the best paper he is \u2026", "venue": "Communications

      can still be found in today''s software. Applications of formal methods to industrial
      practice remain such exceptions that they confirm that the use of formal methods
      is not common practice. We must question the assumptions underlying current
      formal methods to see what needs to be changed. The articles published in Computer''s
      September issue did not do that; they presented minor variations of ideas that
      their authors, and other researchers, have advocated for years. The computer
      science research literature reveals that \" formal methods for software development
      \" are a popular research area. Variants of these approaches are frequently
      discussed and debated at conferences and in journals. Funding agencies often
      require that larger research-funded projects include some cooperation with industrial
      organizations and demonstrate the practicality of an approach on \" real \"
      examples. When authors report such efforts, they state that they are successful.
      Paradoxically, such success stories reveal the failure of industry to adopt
      formal methods as standard procedures; if using these methods was routine, papers
      describing successful use would not be published. T he theme of the feature
      articles in Computer''s September 2009 issue was \" Rethinking Formal Methods.
      \" Rethinking this subject is certainly long overdue. It has been more than
      40 years since the late Robert Floyd showed us how to \" assign meaning to programs
      \" and demonstrated how we could verify that programs will do what they are
      intended to do. 1 It has been at least 35 years since I first heard Jean-Raymond
      Abrial present the ideas that were the basis of Z and its many dialects. The
      Vienna Development Method (VDM) community began its work about the same time.
      Even second-and third-generation formal methods show signs of age. Since 1967,
      there have been numerous \" revolutions \" on the hardware side and amazing
      improvements in man-machine interfaces. The computer systems on my desk today
      were unimaginable when Floyd wrote that article. Unfortunately, there hasn''t
      been comparable progress in formal methods. There have been new languages and

      "how this distinction can be used to dissect models of computing systems into
      subsystems which can be (i) evaluated separately and (ii) represented by a few
      aggre-gative variables whose interactions can be analyzed at a higher level
      of aggregation. The degree of approximation necessitated by this approach remains
      known and is probably the price we have to pay to evaluate complex systems.
      for their encouragement and many valuable suggestions; to J. Georges, MBLE Research
      Laboratory, because a great part of this research is the continuation of some
      earlier work [2] we did together; and toR. Vantilborgh, de Ressources dans un
      Systeme Conversationnel a memoire virtuelle paginee. The paper describes the
      internal structure of a large operating system as a set of cooperating sequential
      processes. The processes synchronize by means of semaphores and extended semaphores
      (queue semaphores). The number of parallel processes is carefully justified,
      and the various semaphore constructions are explained. The system is proved
      to be free of \"deadly embrace\" (deadlock). The design principle is an alternative
      to Dijkstra''s hierarchical structuring of operating systems. The project management
      and the performance are discussed, too. The operating system is the first large
      one using the RC 4000 multipro-gramming system. General permission to republish,

      "abstract": "In this paper we discuss the use of a form of abstract specifications
      for software modules called trace axioms or trace assertions. Specifications
      written in this form precisely describe the external behavior of the module
      and can be automatically tested for consistancy and completeness. Errors revealed
      by the testing process can be rapidly corrected by a man-machine interactive
      process. These specifications could then be interpreted or compiled to form
      a rapid prototype of the final system. I. The Role of Specifications in Software
      Design Large software products can be created more easily and with better quality
      if the task of designing them can be reduced to a series of small tasks. Each
      subtask (called a module) will focus on one aspect of the design and will hide
      the details (Information Hiding Principle [17,20,21]). In order to make the
      design process go smoothly, the intermodule interfaces must be precisely defined.
      Ideally, the interface description states only the requirements that the module
      must satisfy and no more. Such a description is called a specification [22].
      For a straightforward and trouble-free development process, it is highly desirable
      to verfy the correctness of formal specifications of a module before implementing
      the module. While it may not be possible to verify all aspects of the module
      specification, we should at least be able to test such basic properties as consistancy
      and completeness. II. Brief History of Work on Software Specifications We distinguish
      two classes of specifications for software, which we shall denote as P/P (Precondition-Postcondition)
      and DA (Data Abstract). P/P specifications may refer to data struuctures used
      within the module. DA specifications do not. P/P specification techniques are
      based on the pioneering work of Floyd [6] and subsequent work by Hoare [10),
      Dijkstra [2] and others. P/P techniques describe the effect of a program in
      terms of predicates that describe acceptable states of data structures. The
      Precondition is a predicate that describes the states in which a p~ogram may
      be started. The Postcondition describes the states after program termination.
      Mills'' program function can replace both predicates. Djkstra''s predicate transformers
      can also replace both of these predicates by a rule for transforming a postcondition
      into a precondition [2,3). P/P specifications describe the change of state that
      a program must effect, but not how to effect it. Usually, the effect of each
      program is described seperately and in terms of the data structure used by the
      program. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount": 29, "citationCount":

      "title": "Designing Software for a Million Users: it''s not About the Technology",
      "abstract": "Scotland was probably the first country in the world to deploy
      a national digital learning environment in 2006. This was an innovative and
      pioneering system but suffered from two fatal flaws. There were problems with
      the system\u2019s usability and it was a closed system. It offered a set of
      applications that were designed in the early years of the 21 century. Much more
      effective and usable applications had become freely available on the Internet
      before the system was deployed. Our goal was to specify a replacement for this
      original system that avoided the flaws in its design and which provided a range
      of opportunities for teachers to use digital technologies to support learning
      in their classrooms. We wanted to create an open system that could integrate
      the web services and applications that teachers and students really wanted to
      use. Potentially, this system has a large user base. There are more than 3000
      schools in which it will be deployed ranging from tiny rural schools with a
      handful of pupils and a couple of teachers to huge city school campuses, with
      thousands of students. There are more than 50,000 teachers and almost potential
      student users. As an aim was to use the system to involve parents in their childrens\u2019
      education, there are more than a million potential users of the system. The
      key challenges that we faced were not technical problems. Issues we had to address
      were a very wide range of user abilities, complex system governance, a hostile
      user base, heterogeneous hardware and a desire to avoid political risk in deploying
      the system. For many types of user-facing system, the technology is not the
      problem \u2013 it\u2019s the socio-technical stuff that causes the real difficulties.
      Socio-technical factors are the reason why many technically excellent systems
      don\u2019t really work that well. They\u2019re the reason why so many software-intensive
      systems projects are late, over-budget and fail to realise their objectives.
      As engineers, I think it\u2019s time that we faced up to these issues and thought
      about how we can better understand how they affect the systems that we are creating.

      for a renewed mindset and argue that academic research should focus less upon
      physical infrastructure and embrace the abstractions provided by clouds through
      five opportunities: user driven research, new programming models, PaaS environments,
      and improved tools to support elasticity and large-scale debugging. This objective

      as service providers provisioning the functionality directly via the Internet,

      as subscription or pay-per-use. As a result, the generated revenue is difficult
      to analyse due to the highly dynamic nature of the customer''s interaction with
      the service. We present the Services2Cloud framework to assist service providers
      in the analysis of their expected revenue based on customer subscription and
      service usage. Our approach is based on a formal specification of the service
      on offer and a concise expression of the service usage as probabilistic patterns
      which are interpreted as stochastic processes. Key features of our theoretical
      framework have been implemented within a web-based toolkit that aims to facilitate

      "title": "Migrating software products to the cloud: an adaptive STS perspective.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Cloud computing is an example of what Christensen
      (Christensen & Bower, 1996) describes as a disruptive innovation (or technology).
      It has opened up major business opportunities for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
      (SMEs) that develop software products. In the long term, disruptive innovations
      have positive effects on costs, performance and quality (Anderson & Tushman,
      cited in Rosenbloom & Christensen, 1994). Subsequently, cloud computing can
      be attractive for SMEs to enable them to address geographic spread, customer
      service and to develop new markets. The most obvious way that cloud computing
      can be exploited by software developers is through migrating the functionality
      of their products to the cloud and delivering the product functionality as cloud
      services. In the short term, however, disruptive technologies can adversely
      affect company performance because the initial potential revenues are often
      small, and it is difficult to make long term predictions about how markets will
      develop (Bower & Christensen, 1995). So, software SMEs that use cloud computing
      to provide their products as a service increase the risk of the company failing
      because any adverse effects of the disruptive innovation may be felt across
      the whole company. We argue that these effects can be managed by including considerations
      of organisational resilience when making decisions about the potential use of
      disruptive innovations like cloud computing. Despite the potential opportunities
      and risks for organisations, to date most of the research into cloud computing
      has focused on issues such as architectures (e.g. Rochwerger''s et al. RESERVOIR
      model, 2009), potential applications that can be deployed in the cloud (e.g.
      Liu & Orban, 2008) and costs and benefits (e.g. Assuncao et al., 2009 cited
      in Alshamaila & Papagiannidis, 2013). Only recently have people started to consider
      the decision making process that is central to the adoption of cloud computing.
      Adopting cloud computing as a way of delivering products and services involves
      making several choices about: * the type of cloud that will be used to deliver
      the product/services (public, private or hybrid), * how the product''s functionality
      will be delivered, * the cloud provider that will be used, * the pricing model
      that will be used to charge customers for using the product/services. Each of
      these decisions is multi-layered. The decision about the type of cloud to use,
      for example, will depend on the sensitivity of customer data that may be stored
      in the cloud; the location of the cloud infrastructure that will be used; and
      the customer''s existing IT infrastructure. Understanding such decisions is
      important in addressing the potential risks. The cloud adoption toolkit (Khajeh-Hosseini
      et al., 2012) is a process-oriented framework to support decision making. The
      process starts with a technological suitability analysis, which is a short checklist
      for assessing whether cloud computing is appropriate for a particular organisation.
      The most developed part of the cloud adoption toolkit is the cost modelling
      tool, which allows organisations to look at how much their particular set up
      would cost using different cloud providers. A process based approach to adoption
      is also proposed by Zardari & Bahsoon (2011). Their approach is based on the
      use of goal-oriented requirements engineering. They suggest a sequential process
      which emphasises the technical aspects, and allows for some iteration as requirements
      are elaborated and negotiations about service level agreements (SLAs), for example,
      take place. The documented results are used as the basis for establishing more
      formal contracts with cloud providers. Bidgoli (2011) also suggest a process
      based approach based on their own 6 step model which highlights a prescriptive
      set of actions. Their focus, however, is mainly on the technological issues
      involved, and pays less attention to the wider organisational ones. \u2026",

      "title": "USING COMPLEX NETWORK ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION TO ANALYSE PROBLEMATIC
      ENTERPRISE SCALE INFORMATION SYSTEMS", "abstract": "Society is demanding larger
      and more complex information systems to support increasingly complex and critical
      organisational work. During or after the deployment of these systems it is typical
      for problematic socio-technical issues to arise. Whilst troubleshooting socio-technical
      issues in small-to-medium scale situations may be achievable using approaches
      such as rapid ethnography combined with a theoretical framework such as distributed
      cognition or activity theory; troubleshooting enterprise scale situations is
      an open research question because of the overwhelming number of socio-technical
      elements and interactions involved. Techniques and tools for complex network
      analysis enable the analysis of systems comprising large numbers of nodes. These
      tools are becoming increasingly accessible to non-computer scientists and mathematicians
      and so have been used to analyse a diverse variety of large-scale systems from
      social networks through to metabolic pathways in living organisms. We believe
      there is scope to use similar techniques to facilitate the analysis of problematic
      enterprise scale socio-technical systems. This paper demonstrates, via means
      of a case study, proof-of-concept tools for large-scale network analysis and
      visualisation that may provide a promising avenue for identifying problematic
      elements and interactions amongst an overwhelming number of socio- technical
      elements. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by showing that: i)
      a problematic situation may be represented as a directed graph such that the
      elements in the situation are represented as nodes, and interactions between
      nodes as edges; ii) that eigenvector centrality may be used to rank the importance
      of elements in a situation and that highly ranked elements match those identified
      as important by a human analyst; iii) the \u2018complexity\u2019 of a situation,
      or a part of a situation, may be characterised using a feedback degree score
      which provides an indication of the extent elements are highly interconnected
      and involved in feedback loops. T hese findings indicate that computers may
      be used to aid the analysis of problematic large-scale complex socio-technical
      situations by highlighting elements, or groups of interacting elements, that
      are important to the overall outcome of a problematic situation.", "venue":

      "title": "Responsibility Modelling For Resilience", "abstract": "We describe
      a method for modelling responsibilities, which we define as duties that are
      discharged by agents, using some resources in a particular context. Responsibilities
      can be used to analyse socio-technical issues and represent the softer aspects
      of work. The relationships between responsibilities, agents and resources are
      captured using graphical responsibility models. These models help the stakeholders
      to identify vulnerabilities, so that they can then be appropriately managed,
      thereby making complex systems, such as critical national infrastructure, more
      resilient. We have also combined the method with a keyword approach to analyse
      tactical issues, such as alternative system configurations. Responsibility modelling
      is a lightweight method that we have used in areas ranging from contingency
      planning to system assurance. Based on our experiences we have developed checklist
      questions to guide the prospective analysis of complex systems. We are now using
      responsibility modelling to analyse aspects of critical national infrastructure
      in the UK. The discipline of resilience engineering is starting to mature, with
      the development of methods and tools to support the practice. The Functional
      Resonance Analysis Method (Hollnagel, 2004), for example, offers a way of analysing
      systems in terms of component functions and their inter-relationships. We have
      been analysing systems using responsibilities, rather than functions, based
      on our observations that systems often fail due to socio-technical, rather than
      technical reasons. We take a pragmatic view, and define a responsibility as:
      a duty, held by some agent, to achieve, maintain or avoid some given state,
      subject to conformance with organisational, social and cultural norms. The key
      features of responsibilities are: that they are allocated to agents (usually
      people or organisations, but they could also be some technology or a software
      application); that resources (time, people, information or physical resources)
      are needed to discharge them; and that they are discharged in a context which

      "title": "1 Introduction: Dependability and Responsibility in Context", "abstract":
      "This book looks at socio-technical systems, that is systems which consist of
      a group of people working with some complex technology in order to achieve some
      common purpose. We shall be dealing in the main with the case of the technology
      being a computer system, though the ideas we shall present are applicable to
      other forms of technology, and we shall also discuss them in the context of
      a railway system. The main reason for looking at socio-technical systems is
      to explore the extent to which ideas of dependability, which have been developed
      for technical systems for some decades now, can be applied to socio-technical
      systems. It is no longer good enough simply to say that a failure was due to
      a computer error; in most cases there was a human error along the line too.
      We shall be looking at what sorts of thing can be said about error that applies
      to both computer error and human error. These ideas are not so much concerned
      with what causes errors, but how errors can be prevented or recovered from.
      It is this focus on prevention and recovery that led us to understand that there
      are indeed some concepts and structures that are common to the ways that errors
      are managed in both technical and human systems, though the actual causes may
      well be of very different kinds. We now introduce two major concepts that this
      book is about: dependability and responsibility. Dependability is a term that
      has been used by computer engineers for three decades or more to mean that the
      computer system can be trusted to do what it is supposed to do, and our discussion
      of dependability in this introduction will closely follow the standard texts.
      However, as we will see, some of the thinking has to be revised somewhat if
      it is to be applied to the kind of socio-technical systems that are the subject
      of this book. We shall show that these revisions bring in human concepts of
      responsibility \u2013roughly, that doing what you\u2019re supposed to do means
      discharging the responsibilities that you have been given or have assumed\u2013
      and that this reinterpretation leads to ways of thinking about the relationship
      between people and computers in carrying out some socio-technical task to be
      performed by people and computers working together. We shall then introduce
      the idea of modelling responsibilities, saying something about what we mean
      by a \u2018model\u2019. We shall explain that making a model of responsibilities
      is a way of building a bridge between the social discourse of responsibilities
      for tasks and states of affairs in the world, and the architectural or engineering
      discourse of making an artifact that assists a person in performing those tasks
      or bringing about (or maintaining or preventing) those states of affairs. Since
      this book is about the social aspects of a socio-technical system as well as
      the technical ones, it will discuss the use of ethnographic methods to discover
      how responsibilities actually lie in an organisation. This chapter therefore
      also contains a brief introduction to the use of ethnographic studies in understanding
      responsibilities. These basic ideas \u2013dependability, responsibility, modelling
      and ethnography\u2013 and the relationships between them are expanded later
      in the book, so although the reader may well be justified in thinking that this
      introduction raises questions that it does not answer and that there is more
      to be said, we hope the remainder of the book will go some way to saying more
      and answering at least some of these questions.", "venue": "", "year": 2010,

      financial and technical analysis offered by providers. Our results show that
      the system infrastructure in the case study would have cost 37% less over 5
      years on EC2, and using cloud computing could have potentially eliminated 21%
      of the support calls for this system. These findings seem significant enough
      to call for a migration of the system to the cloud but our stakeholder impact
      analysis revealed that there are significant risks associated with this. Whilst
      the benefits of using the cloud are attractive, we argue that it is important
      that enterprise decision-makers consider the overall organizational implications

      the actual source of failure. We propose a novel method, Stakeholder Impact
      Analysis, that can be used to identify risks associated with socio-complexity
      as it is grounded in insights from the social sciences, psychology and management
      science. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Stakeholder Impact Analysis
      by using the 1992 London Ambulance Service Computer Aided Dispatch project as
      a case study, and shows that had our method been used to identify the risks
      and had they been mitigated, it would have reduced the risk of project failure.
      This paper''s original contribution comprises expanding upon existing accounts
      of failure by examining failures at a level of granularity not seen elsewhere

      informal communication and virtual interaction. The software has been developed
      using a person-centred design approach that specifically favours simplicity
      and flexibility of use over functionality and power. Early participation from
      the older people was in the form of adapted cultural probes [8]. As the design
      progressed participation took the form of iterative criticism of the design,
      and informal user tests with older people. The system allows older people to
      easily discover who else is currently using the system, and therefore potentially
      available to chat with, interact with or play games with. The games also allow
      voice chat so players can socialise while playing. The application of this software
      has the possible use of encouraging intergenerational communication.", "venue":

      computing represents a shift away from computing as a product that is purchased,
      to computing as a service that is delivered to consumers over the internet from
      large-scale data centers - or \"clouds\". This paper discusses some of the research
      challenges for cloud computing from an enterprise or organizational perspective,
      and puts them in context by reviewing the existing body of literature in cloud
      computing. Various research challenges relating to the following topics are
      discussed: the organizational changes brought about by cloud computing; the
      economic and organizational implications of its utility billing model; the security,
      legal and privacy issues that cloud computing raises. It is important to highlight
      these research challenges because cloud computing is not simply about a technological
      improvement of data centers but a fundamental change in how IT is provisioned
      and used. This type of research has the potential to influence wider adoption
      of cloud computing in enterprise, and in the consumer market too.", "venue":

      provisioning of computing resources within the enterprise. This paper describes
      the challenges that decision makers face when assessing the feasibility of the
      adoption of cloud computing in their organizations, and describes our Cloud
      Adoption Toolkit, which has been developed to support this process. The toolkit
      provides a framework to support decision makers in identifying their concerns,
      and matching these concerns to appropriate tools/techniques that can be used
      to address them. Cost Modeling is the most mature tool in the toolkit, and this
      paper shows its effectiveness by demonstrating how practitioners can use it
      to examine the costs of deploying their IT systems on the cloud. The Cost Modeling
      tool is evaluated using a case study of an organization that is considering
      the migration of some of its IT systems to the cloud. The case study shows that
      running systems on the cloud using a traditional \u2018always on\u2019 approach
      can be less cost effective, and the elastic nature of the cloud has to be used
      to reduce costs. Therefore, decision makers have to model the variations in
      resource usage and their systems'' deployment options to obtain accurate cost

      "title": "Towards a Multi-level Model of Conflict to Sensitise practitioners
      to the Socio-organisational Complexity of an IT Systems Development Project",
      "abstract": "Practitioners are typically aware that organisational complexity
      is important to IT project performance however they are unsure of exactly what
      it comprises and how they should take it into account in their decision-making.
      This paper contributes to addressing the \u2018what\u2019 question by taking
      a multi-level conflict approach to understanding the relationship between individuals,
      groups and IT project complexity an area in the literature so far unexplored
      and thus the basis of this literature survey and theory development. We first
      assess existing studies of conflict using semantic analysis to identify the
      basic components of conflict. We consequently examine the relationship between
      these components. Lastly we formulate a multilevel model of the phenomena to
      relate conflict to IT Systems Development Project (ISDP) complexity. The resulting
      model of conflict in ISDPs suggests that conflicts can occur at three different
      the levels: individual; intra-group; and inter-group. And that the following
      can be the objects of conflict: tasks, processes, relationships, roles, time,
      resources, capabilities, values, status, distributive justice, procedural justice.
      This approach is interesting as the types of characteristics identified by using
      insights from applied psychology and management are at a granularity that enables
      practitioners to get a handle on aspects of socioorganisational complexity and
      thus opens up action research as an approach to studying ISDP complexity.",

      of design for dependability has been to avoid, detect or tolerate system faults
      so that these do not result in failures that are detectable outside the system.
      Whilst this is potentially achievable in medium size systems that are controlled
      by a single organisations, it is now practically impossible to achieve in large-scale
      systems of systems where different parts of the system are owned and controlled
      by different organisations. Therefore, we must accept the inevitability of failure
      and re-orient our system design strategies to recover from those failures at
      minimal cost and as quickly as possible. This talk will discuss why such recovery
      strategies cannot be purely technical but must be socio-technical in nature
      and argue that design for recovery will require a better understanding of how
      people recover from failure and the information they need during that recovery
      process. I will argue that supporting recovery should be a fundamental design
      objective of systems and explore what this means for current approaches to large-scale

      "title": "Construction by configuration: A new challenge for software engineering
      education", "abstract": "Software reuse has been the subject of software engineering
      research for more than 20 years. Although there are still problems to be overcome,
      reuse is one of the major success stories of software engineering and software
      development with reuse has become the dominant approach to the development of
      business software systems. However, although component-based software engineering
      [1] is starting to have a significant impact, the majority of this reuse is
      not the reuse of software components written in conventional programming languages
      such as Java or C++. Rather, it is the reuse of large-scale modules in ERP systems
      such as SAP/R3 or the reuse of generic software systems, designed for a particular
      domain and configured for the needs of specific customers. If we look at the
      teaching of software engineering, however (and, it must be said, the presentation
      of the subject in software engineering textbooks), this approach to development
      is rarely mentioned. Mili\u2019s book on software reuse [2], for example, devotes
      20 pages out of 600 to COTS-based reuse and does not mention problems of configuring
      COTS for specific customer requirements. The focus of teaching is primarily
      on the engineering of systems using conventional programming languages. In the
      ACM/IEEE proposals for curricula in software engineering [3], software reuse
      and COTS are mentioned briefly but are given very little emphasis and, in general,
      they are always considered to be part of something else, such as software evolution,
      rather than topics in their own right. By ignoring this economically significant
      to software development, I believe that we are doing our students a disservice.
      Of course, students have to understand conventional software development practice
      and, of course, this is a major challenge in its own right. However, by focusing
      exclusively on this topic we do not equip our students with an understanding
      of the realities of much software development in the 21st century and we exacerbate
      the problem that many employers of our students do not believe that student
      skills match their real needs. In this paper, I discuss the principles of \u2018construction
      by configuration\u2019 and the very real difficulties of teaching those principles
      in a university environment. I then go on to suggest how we, as educators, might
      address these problems and so broaden the scope of software engineering education.",

      from the Joint Information Systems Committee and from industry, the AHM provides
      a forum for the e-Science community to present and demonstrate their research,
      exchange ideas and socialize. The AHM typically attracts approximately 600 participants
      from academia, industry and commerce, with a technical programme of keynote
      presentations, regular sessions, workshops, poster sessions and birds-of-a-feather
      meetings. The term \u2018e-Science\u2019 was first coined by Sir John Taylor,
      then Director General of the Research Councils, who said that \u2018e-Science
      is about global collaboration in key areas of science and the next generation
      of infrastructure that will enable it\u2019. Such collaboration often takes
      place through the secure sharing of resources distributed across multiple partners,
      which has led Foster and Kesselmann to formulate the concept of the Virtual
      Organization. The Grid is a closely-related concept that refers to the distributed
      hardware, software and data that are often used to support collaboration. As

      in multi-site software development environment", "abstract": "cal component
      in several applications. One unique area of research is the software engineering
      ontology. The software engineering ontology defines common sharable software
      engineering knowledge including particular project information. Software engineering
      ontology typically provides software engineering concepts \u2013 what they are,
      how they are related, and can be related to one another \u2013 for representing
      and communicating over software engineering knowledge and project information.
      These concepts facilitate common understanding of software engineering project
      information to all the distributed members of a development team in a multi-site
      development environment. Reaching a consensus of understanding is of benefit
      in a distributed multi-site software development environment. Software engineering
      knowledge is represented in the software engineering ontology whose instantiations
      are undergoing evolution. Software engineering ontology instantiations signify
      project information which is shared and has evolved to reflect project development,
      changes in software requirements or in the design process, to incorporate additional
      functionality to systems or to allow incremental improvement, etc. The software
      engineering ontology contains abstractions of the software engineering domain
      concepts and instantiations. There are two types of the abstraction which are
      the generic software engineering and the specific software engineering. The
      abstraction of the generic one represents the concepts that are common to a
      whole set of software engineering concepts, while the abstraction of the specific
      one represents the set of software engineering concepts that are specifically
      used for some categories of particular projects. The instantiations, also known
      as population, are simply the project data. The abstraction of the specific
      software engineering ontology has its instantiations utilised for storing data
      instances of the projects. Each abstraction can have multiple instantiations
      in different circumstances of projects. The corresponding concrete data instances
      are stored as instantiations. Software engineering ontology instantiations are
      derived as a result of populating software engineering project information and
      are referred to as ontology instances of software engineering ontology classes.

      data and project agreement to the concepts defined in the software engineering

      "abstract": "Summary The software engineering ontology defines common sharable
      software engineering knowledge including particular project information. Reaching
      a consensus of understanding is of benefit in a distributed multi-site software
      development environment. Software engineering knowledge is represented in the
      software engineering ontology whose instantiations are undergoing evolution.
      Software engineering ontology instantiations signify project information which
      is shared and has evolved to reflect project development, changes in software
      requirements or in the design process, to incorporate additional functionality
      to systems or to allow incremental improvement, etc. This evolution of instances
      provides many new challenges to an ability to design and deliver project information.
      In this paper, we present development of application tools to facilitate software
      engineering ontology instantiations management.", "venue": "", "year": 2007,

      "title": "PREview: Tackling the Real Concerns of Requirements Engineering",
      "abstract": "A common complaint from industrial development projects is that
      systems fail to address the real concerns of the major stakeholders. This results
      in much rework as missing requirements are identified, or incorrectly stressed
      requirements are changed at later stages in the life-cycle. A major cause of
      these problems is that the overriding needs become subsumed in the general welter
      of requirements information. For example, safety-critical systems enter service
      which are compromised by secondary requirements such as efficiency or throughput.
      These high-level, paramount needs, which are frequently vaguely expressed, represent
      the true concerns of the major stakeholders. As such they should be carefully
      elaborated and then used to drive the requirements process in such a way that
      conflicting requirements are identified early and negotiated away. This paper
      describes a method called PREview which integrates concerns into a viewpoint-oriented
      approach. PREview mandates the explicit identification and elaboration of concerns
      at the commencement of a requirements analysis and orients the rest of the process
      to the assurance of compliance with those concerns. It provides a light-weight
      and pragmatic approach to requirements engineering where the need to address

      "In previous chapters, we have discussed the ways in which we can model how
      responsibility can be assigned to agents and how responsibility models can facilitate
      discussions about the nature of responsibilities in organisations. These models
      document responsibilities in an organisation, provide insights into possible
      vulnerabilities due to responsibility misassignment and facilitate discussion
      about the nature of specific responsibilities. However, we have not, so far,
      tried to model the responsibilities themselves. Such a model might include information
      about the attributes of the responsibility, the relationships between these
      attributes and how one responsibility is dependent on other responsibilities.
      The difficulties of developing such a model of responsibilities as abstractions
      in their own right should not be under-estimated. We have already discussed
      how the word \u2018responsibility\u2019 is used in a very broad way and it is
      not possible, in our view, to have a single model that encompasses all different
      types of responsibility. A further difficulty arises because responsibilities
      are always interpreted by the holder of the responsibility and their culture,
      education, competence and experience influences that interpretation. This is
      one reason why it is often difficult to decide who should be blamed when some
      accident or incident occurs and a tribunal of some kind examines the ways in
      which individuals have discharged their assigned responsibilities. Because of
      these difficulties, I focus here on the more limited, but still challenging,
      problem of modelling causal responsibilities. Recall that causal responsibility
      is the responsibility of making some state of affairs come about or of acting
      to ensure that some undesirable situation does not occur. Each causal responsibility
      has an associated consequential responsibility where the consequential responsibility
      defines who takes the blame in the event of failure or, sometimes, the credit
      in the event of success. The agent that is assigned a causal responsibility
      may, but need not, be the holder of the corresponding consequential responsibility.
      For example, an automated agent assigned a causal responsibility cannot be assigned
      the related consequential responsibility \u2013 computer systems cannot take
      the blame for failure. Modelling causal responsibilities, without regard for
      the agent assigned these responsibilities, is helpful for a number of reasons:",

      "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the engineering of dependable web
      services. We have developed an approach based on deploying existing web services
      within a middleware framework so that they are fault tolerant. Our approach
      is independent of the services themselves and may be configured to support a
      range of different fault tolerance mechanisms. Central to the approach are what
      we call fault tolerant service containers. These \u2018contain\u2019 externally
      provided services and incorporate support for fault detection and recovery.
      Containers are configurable with an XML-based recovery policy model that specifies
      what kind of fault tolerance mechanisms may be applied to the services it contains.
      The container serves as a proxy so that the existence of fault tolerance can
      be transparent to a service client. A tool and SDK simplify the creation and
      deployment of the container and its policy. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses
      of our approach and include some measurements of the overheads involved. We
      conclude that our container-based mechanism provides a simple, low cost approach

      "title": "Models for responsibility assignment 1 8 Models for Responsibility
      Assignment", "abstract": "Responsibility assignment modelling is concerned with
      developing a picture of how the responsibilities in a socio-technical system
      are distributed across the different automated elements and actors in that system.
      At this stage, we are not concerned with the details of the responsibilities
      themselves, nor with what the actors in the system have to do to discharge these
      responsibilities. Rather, a responsibility model presents a succinct picture
      of ''who is responsible for what'' that can be used to identify responsibilities
      that have not been assigned, responsibilities that have been misassigned and
      actors in the system who may be overloaded with responsibilities. We argue that
      these models have a role to play in identifying sources of undependability in
      a system. They can be used to help identify requirements that are inconsistent
      with the responsibility structures and to design robust and reliable operational
      processes. The primary use of responsibility assignment models is to serve as
      a basis for facilitating discussions on how responsibilities are distributed
      in an existing system and for planning the responsibility structure of new systems.
      In any system, there is some flexibility over ''who does what'' and individual
      responsibilities are always subject to negotiation. By making responsibilities
      explicit, a responsibility assignment model allows designers, users and managers
      to develop a shared understanding of the responsibility structure in a system.
      This helps designers understand who needs what information and when they need
      it. In addition, the responsibility assignment model may be a useful supporting
      mechanism for identifying possible responsibility vulnerabilities in a system.
      Responsibility negotiation occurs during the specification and design phases
      of a socio-technical system. The system designers must negotiate with stakeholders
      to decide how the responsibilities associated with the system are distributed.
      Clearly, there are trade-offs to be made between automated and manual tasks.
      However, issues such as organisational structures and politics also affect the
      distribution of responsibilities. Responsibility renegotiation occurs when some
      of the actors in a system renegotiate their assigned responsibilities so that
      the distribution of responsibilities in the system is changed. This may be required
      because the organisational structure has changed, because some actors are over
      or under-loaded, because of changes in the people in a system, or because of
      new responsibilities that emerge as a system is deployed and used. The role

      we thoroughly examine, through a range of techniques, the social circumstances
      and conditions of the setting where technologies are to be deployed and consequently
      think carefully about how to design for that setting. We believe such an approach
      is critical in order to develop a better understanding of the requirements for

      briefly discuss two tools; firstly, SQRM, designed to allow service discovery,

      The initial outlines and developments are sometimes considered without reference

      The paper will contrast the two design methodologies and determine which elements
      are useful and appropriate and what design lessons can be learned. Both studies
      used qualitative approaches but the first undertook the software development
      prior to gaining certain user views through the use of interviews and questionnaires,

      the design via a number of methods including \u2018cultural probes\u2019, observation,

      approaches to role-based information systems assume that a role definition is
      one-sided, in that it applies to an individual person or single organisational
      entity. In fact, however, many roles are defined as a relationship between two
      entities (e.g. customer\u2014supplier, doctor\u2014patient), and it is the nature
      of the relationships in which an individual participates that defines a role.
      This reconceptualisation of a role as a relationship rather than as a set of
      properties of a single entity has a number of implications for requirements
      elicitation, system design, and information structures. We explore some of the
      implications and requirements and show how they can lead to significantly different

      process improvements and there is some evidence to suggest that process improvement
      leads to business benefits. However, whether these business benefits were a

      paper documents work from the EPSRC \u2018EQUATOR\u2019 and Dependability Interdisciplinary
      Research Collaboration on Computer Based Systems (DIRC) concerned with the appropriate
      design of dependable assistive technology to enable older and disabled people
      to maintain a quality of life within their own homes. Technology, especially
      so\u2010called \u2018smart home\u2019 technology, can only be used to assist
      people if it is effectively designed. Designers are therefore required to consider
      certain key questions such as what situation they are designing for, what solutions
      should do, and who should use them. The focus in this paper is on understanding
      and identifying user needs and system requirements for dependability in the
      complex challenge of inclusive design. The feature of inclusive design addressed
      here is the new emphasis on the user, a living, breathing person situated in
      real world settings along with others, rather than some designer''s abstraction.
      The acceptance or rejection of assistive technology relies on the users'' perceptions
      of the designed technology as well as the appropriateness of the technology
      designed. Consequently, this paper suggests that despite highly imaginative
      views of future technologies, getting such dreams to work generally means they
      must, at some point, meet the real world and engage with the needs of users
      if they are to be sufficiently grounded. Given this emphasis on users, the highly
      personal character of domestic settings presents conventional research techniques
      with obdurate problems that can make research practically and ethically difficult.
      Researching domestic spaces and domestic values requires different methods to
      understand the unique needs and experiences of residents. Accordingly, the authors
      report on their experiences of using observational studies and adapting \u2018cultural
      probes\u2019 to foster an ongoing dialogue with the members of their user groups,
      to gain insights into their needs and generate design relevant information and
      inspiration. The paper discusses how such information might feed into dependable
      design through consideration of a model of dependability.", "venue": "", "year":

      "title": "Dependability within Peer-to-Peer Systems", "abstract": "There is
      an increasing interest in using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architectures as a basis
      for software systems. However, by their very nature, achieving dependability
      within a P2P system can be difficult. This paper provides an initial analysis
      of the main issues that need to be considered when developing a dependable P2P
      system. It examines the key properties that can influence the dependability
      of a P2P system, and discusses the relationship between system dependability
      and the choice of logical network architecture. 1 Dependability and Peer-to-Peer
      A system\u2019s dependability can be thought of as being its trustworthiness
      [9]. The difficulty when attempting to measure dependability is that it is typically
      a context sensitive property. While one user might regard a system to be dependable
      for the particular activities they use it for, another user might regard it
      to be undependable for their activities. Traditionally dependability has also
      been regarded as multidimensional, in that it can be influenced by a variety
      of other attributes. Key attributes include availability, reliability, responsiveness,
      safety and security [9]. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing has become very popular
      in recent years. Essentially it can be thought of as a class of application
      that takes advantage of the resources and services that are available at the
      edge of the Internet [8]. There is an increasing interest in using P2P as a
      basis for software systems within industry, where it can be used to support
      activities such as communication between workers. However for P2P technology
      to be adopted within such an environment it also needs to be dependable and
      achieving dependability within a P2P system can be difficult. In particular
      P2P systems possess a number of specific properties that can have an influence
      on the system''s dependability attributes (security, reliability, etc). For
      example, the type of peer discovery mechanism used can influence the responsiveness
      of a P2P system. A broadcast discovery mechanism can result in slower performance
      than with using a centralised peer lookup server. Consequently, when considering
      dependability within P2P system design, it is also becomes necessary to consider
      these specific P2P properties. Dependability within P2P systems is further complicated
      by the numerous P2P logical network architectures (abstractions of the underlying
      physical network) that exist and no single architecture is likely to be suitable
      for all application types. For example, Napster [7] benefits most from a semi-centralised
      architecture (provides more efficient resource searching), whereas a decentralised
      architecture is more suitable for FreeNet (better anonymity support) [2]. The
      different types of logical network architecture can also influence the P2P properties
      and general system dependability. Decentralised P2P systems are likely to be
      better suited at handling denial of service attacks, the central authority provided
      by semi-centralised systems would be better suited for handling peer certification.
      Designers, when deciding on a suitable logical network architecture, also need
      to take into account the dependability requirements of the system. In some cases
      this will restrict the logical network architecture options that are available.
      This paper describes some of our current work within the EU funded P2P ARCHITECT
      project, which seeks to develop methods and tools to support the building of
      dependable P2P software systems. The paper aims to identify the main properties
      (additional to availability, reliability, responsiveness, safety and security)
      that can influence a P2P systems dependability, and how these in turn can be
      influenced by or influence the choice of underlying logical network architecture.
      The paper begins by presenting the key P2P dependability properties that we
      have derived from studying existing dependability properties and applying and
      analysing their importance within a P2P environment. The paper then summarises
      the common types of P2P logical network architectures, and provides an initial
      discussion of the relationship between the properties and architecture. 2 Dependability
      Properties of P2P Systems To structure and help readability the key dependability
      properties that we have identified have been placed into three categories. External
      properties \u2013 properties that can be only viewed externally (for example,
      by the user). Internal properties \u2013 properties that can be viewed from
      within the system (for example, by a system component). Hybrid properties properties
      that can be viewed both internally and externally. A brief summary of the properties
      is provided here. A more detailed description is provided in [6]. 2.1 External
      properties Scalability Scalability is the ability of a system to operate without
      a noticeable drop in performance despite increases or decreases in its overall
      operational size. Peer-to-peer systems, by their very nature, are designed to
      be distributed over many peers. Accordingly, catering for scalability should
      play a fundamental role when designing for a dependable peerto-peer system,
      and can have influences on dependability attributes such as reliability, availability
      and responsiveness. Survivability Survivability is the capability of a system
      to fulfil its mission in a timely manner in the presence of attacks, failures,
      or accidents [1]. Survivability in P2P systems raises some interesting issues,
      as in some cases the inherent redundancy can help attain survivability, whilst
      the lack of a central control can hinder it. Furthermore a system''s survivability
      can also have an influence on its dependability attributes such as reliability
      and availability. Maintainability Maintainability represents the ease in which
      the system can be changed after it has been delivered and is in use [9]. A major
      issue with P2P maintenance is updating peer software. It cannot be assumed that
      all peers will be updated and this can be particularly important for critical
      issues (for example security patches). Given the range of issues that maintainability
      can affect and given the distributed nature of P2P, it should be viewed as being
      a critical property when designing a dependable P2P system. Manageability Manageability
      reflects the ease in which the system as a whole can be managed (which can be
      important in business environments). Although not an obvious dependability property,
      a system''s manageability can influence other issues such as security and maintainability.
      Its importance is also further raised given that it is often harder to control
      all aspects of a P2P system. Repairability A system is regarded as being repairable
      if it allows defect correction with minimal effort. A repairable system needs
      to be able to detect the faults and then perform corrective maintenance. As
      P2P systems are distributed in nature the main difficultly is how to identify
      and repair defects that can occur throughout the network. This is especially
      the case for decentralised systems and so can make repairability an important
      property for when designing dependable P2P systems. Trust Trust can depend on
      a range of properties. For example, it can be influenced by the perceived dependability
      of the system, its security measures, or the behaviour of other users. Actually
      defining and measuring trust is a difficult task due to its subjective nature.
      As a result in terms of dependability it is a complex property to consider.
      However there is a link between trust and dependability, and within distributed
      systems trust (of users and machines) can be a crucial issue. 2.2 Internal properties
      Network evolution Studies of existing P2P systems have shown that the logical
      network architecture used can evolve over time [5]. Although P2P systems set
      out to give all their peers equal status, in reality this is very difficult
      to achieve due to the different resources available to each peer. Because P2P
      systems are likely to evolve during use, a dependable system would need to be
      able to cater for this eventuality. The evolution of the system could have implications
      for dependability attributes such as security and maintainability. Legacy versions
      It is likely that as new versions of the P2P software are released, not all
      peers within the network will upgrade. Consequently you can have the scenario
      where multiple versions of the software are run across the network. A P2P system
      needs to be able to still operate despite the different versions of the software
      that might be running on the peers. For designing a P2P system that is upgradeable
      whilst also maintaining system dependability, legacy is going to be an issue
      that needs to be tackled. Fault Tolerance Fault tolerance is the ability for
      a system to continue giving a correct service following the manifestation of
      a fault either through errors in the system design, implementation or introduced
      following an attack [9]. Fault tolerance is a particularly important issue within
      P2P given its distributed nature. Designers would need to decided how faults
      will be recognised and dealt with in a distributed manner. Clearly the ability
      of a system to resist and tackle faults will have an influence on its perceived
      dependability. Connection bandwidth How peers are connected together in a P2P
      network can vary considerably, from a user connecting via a modem, to a machine
      connected via a T3 connection. Consequently the amount of network bandwidth
      available to a single peer can vary considerably. Ideally a dependable P2P system
      should be able to operate no matter the connection bandwidth, and should be
      designed in such away to avoid hindering system attributes such as reliability,
      availability and responsiveness. Intermittent peer connectivity Due to the very
      nature of peer-to-peer, it cannot be assumed that peers within such a network
      are connected at all times. When designing a peer-to-peer system, it is important
      to cater for a peer\u2019s intermittent connectivity and not assume that a peer
      will always be co", "venue": "International Conference on Software Engineering",

      "The population of older people is increasing proportionately such that there
      is a need to find methods of ensuring a quality of life for this older generation,
      whilst not placing too much stress on existing over-stretched resources. A simple
      answer that has become a trend in the UK is to use alarm systems to enable residents
      to remain at home for longer, rather than be admitted to alterative \u2018institutional\u2019
      accommodation. These alarm (alert) systems are social alarms designed to support
      a care package by providing alerts when certain activities (falls, wandering
      etc) are identified. Although social alarm systems have not been considered
      traditionally to be a part of assistive technology, they are entering this classification
      as the simple alarm is no longer a simple alarm. Social alarm or alert systems
      are becoming more complex and their names are being modified to \u201csmart\u201d,
      \u201ctelecare\u201d or \u201cadvanced\u201d. UK Government resolve concerning
      telecare system, as part of a community support package has meant a great upsurge
      in interest from health and social care providers in these systems. This paper
      explores the role of social alarms and telecare in supporting older, impaired
      and disabled people in their own home and suggests some areas of potential problem
      with the roll out of the systems. We then explore a real installation of technology
      in Scotland in which adults with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) needs are
      being met through appropriate technology, comprising bespoke systems, individually
      designed but adaptable for future residents. The paper demonstrates that technology
      does not need to be distinct from the fabric of the home and can be incorporated
      in the design from the onset of the planning stages and architectural designs
      whilst considering the potential difficulties of following the standard telecare
      pathway. 1 There are fairly clear distinctions between these forms of technology
      but essentially they are similar in that they operate on a response alert basis.
      Should One Be Alarmed By Technology Adaptations In The Home? Page 2 of 16 The
      Ageing and Impaired Society In order to contextualise this paper let us begin
      with some basic preconceptions relating to older people, disability and impairment.
      For example Sidell (1995) who elucidate the idea that the \u201celderly\u201d
      cannot be considered as a homogeneous group. It is clear that the main characteristic
      that all older people share is that they are similar in age and might have lived
      through similar historic periods. Sidell also highlights many of the now taken
      for granted assumptions such as the medicalised model that equates increasing
      in years with disability and ill health as being inaccurate. Clearly, as the
      population gets proportionately older there is a tendency to equate all older
      people as sharing certain commonalities. It is easier to consider older people
      as an amorphous abstract conception, from which one can then generalise prescriptions
      from and to. Within our research at Lancaster University we have been designing
      technology to support older and disabled people in their own homes and spent
      a considerable time with these residents in their own homes allowing them to
      offer us glimpses into their lives. A clear outcome of this research is that
      we found that no two people were the same. It is true that some had similar
      aspirations and had similar activity patterns, but essentially everyone was
      unique and impossible to generalise from. When the time came to ascertain what
      they wanted from the technology the disparate views were the majority. A similar
      argument could be made for people with impairments and/or disabilities in which
      assumptions originating from the \u201cinability\u201d to undertake tasks have
      been used to argue for societal changes both for the better and for the worse,.
      The recent implementation of the Part M and Part T (England and Scotland) of
      the building regulations can be considered to be an exemplary case. The regulations
      enable wheelchair access as well as access for mobility difficulties to new
      buildings but the revision is based on an assumption that disabled people are
      mobility impaired, which is clearly false. Legislative regulations are an ideal
      way of ensuring that minor revision to buildings are implemented, but this does
      not enable the home to be suitable for all, for their whole lifetime. It is
      true that some homes are never likely to be suitable for all people, as their
      original design was such that alterations to make them more inclusive would
      be prohibitively costly. Buildings that can be salvaged, and 2 Sidell (1995)
      Health in Old Age, Open University Press 3 ibid 4 ibid 5 We would like to thank
      MHA Care Group, Barrow Age Concern and Dundee Social Work for their assistance
      in this research. 6 There is a newer definition of disability/impairment from
      the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
      categorisation (WHO 2002, http://www3.who.int/icf/icftemplate.cfm ). For the
      purposes of this paper we adhere to the more \u2018traditional\u2019 split of
      disability/impairment. We currently refer to disability and impairment in the
      original Social Model sense (see: Barnes, Mercer and Shakespeare (2001) Exploring
      Disability, Polity Press), impairment being a disability that is not permanent.

      building structure and layout is a small, but important, aspect of inclusivity,
      but far from the whole story. Currently for a home to be inclusive and appropriate
      for older and disabled people, the structural and spatial aspects are now being
      complemented by technology designed to support the resident. Current technology
      tends to be retrofitted into existing homes and therefore is limited by costs
      and installation problems, as well as the types of technology available.", "venue":

      the organisation of work, activity, and interaction among participants, and
      with, through, and around artifacts. These patterns are organised around a framework

      Previous work on the relationship between ethnomethodology and design has been
      concerned primarily in providing presentation frameworks and mechanisms, practical

      the collection of patterns based on findings, their comparison across studies
      and their general implications for design problems, rather than the concerns

      attention is paid to our evaluations and to how they inform how the patterns

      the composition of the collection as it has emerged. The paper finishes, first,

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper considers the main aspects and questions that
      are required to be asked by any designer of residences that include high-end
      technology for people with disabilities. It seeks to reframe the design process
      to extend the concepts of inclusive and universal design within the social context
      of designing for people with a wide range of disabilities. Designing smart homes
      for disabled or older people is not different from designing the home for people
      without any form of impairment on the one hand. On the other hand, there is
      a perceptual shift that is required in order to ensure needs are met from all
      stakeholders. There is a need to determine the needs of the occupant(s) and
      reflect these needs within the overall design. Keywords: Design, Dependability,

      Design Criteria, Cultural Probes Introduction This paper is derived from the
      work of three projects, namely DIRC (www.dirc.org.uk), EQUATOR (www.equator.ac.uk)
      and CUSTODIAN (www.smartthinking.ukideas/custindex.html). Designing homes that
      meet the needs of disabled people is not as straightforward as might first appear,
      especially when technology is likely to be performing a central role in the
      finished design. This paper unpacks the main factors within the design process.
      It reflects the main considerations that have been derived from designing residences
      for people with cognitive impairments and physical disabilities. Four main areas
      of significance are covered within the paper, which together allow the designer
      a wider picture of the overall design. A methodological underpinning to the
      design process has stemmed from Manderville [16] who demonstrates that technology

      This paper reports on two qualitative methods - ''technology biographies'' and

      - \"Its life, Jim, but not as we know it\". This paper reports on the ongoing
      development and deployment of qualitative methods - ''technology biographies''
      and ''cultural probes'' - to facilitate research in a long-term interdisciplinary
      research project exploring issues of dependability in ubiquitous computing in
      domestic settings - homes. It is clear that this relatively under researched
      area represents a major challenge for computer science, since the requirements
      for systems in the home are both crudely and subtly different from those in
      the workplace, calling in turn for new field study, modelling, analysis and
      implementation techniques. Our project is especially concerned to develop \u2018enabling\u2019
      or \u2018assistive\u2019 technologies for user groups with different support
      needs in a variety of care settings where research suggests technology may enable

      "This paper documents work from the EPSRC \u2018EQUATOR\u2019 and \u2018Dependability\u2019
      Interdisciplinary Research Collaborations, concerned with the appropriate design
      of assistive technology to enable older people maintain a quality of life within
      their own homes. The focus of this paper is methodological since methods for
      identifying user needs and system requirements in home and care settings are
      relatively underdeveloped and present a very complex set of challenges for inclusive
      design. We report on our experiences of using observational studies and adapting
      \u2018cultural probes\u2019 to foster an ongoing dialogue with the members of
      our user groups, to gain insights into their needs and generate design relevant
      information and inspiration. Introduction: understanding user requirements In
      recent years there has been a \u2018turn to the social\u2019 in system design.
      The emphasis on \u2018the social\u2019 and understanding the detail of social
      settings was intended to develop more appropriate methods of analysing activities
      and their settings as a means of informing design and thereby making end-use
      a much more prominent feature of system development. With the advent of ubiquitous
      computing and the growing presence of computer systems in everyday domestic
      environments, the home has become a growing focus for research. However, it
      may be that we require significant shifts in our investigative techniques to
      consider how technology relates to such different settings and users. Uncovering
      the detailed nature of the social organisation of domestic life is essential.
      Before designers can solve a design problem they need to understand some basics
      \u2013 such as what they are designing, what it should do and who should use
      it. There is consequently a renewed emphasis on the user, and a new kind of
      end-user, namely, a living, breathing person who carries on their daily life
      within a \u2018real time, real world\u2019. As designers increasingly turn towards
      research methods that bring them closer to people\u2019s aspirations and their
      lives as really lived, so user-orientated qualitative", "venue": "", "year":

      "title": "Designing Dependable Digital Domestic Environments", "abstract": "The
      aim of this paper is to examine the distinctions between home and organizational
      settings with particular reference to assistive technologies (AT) and outline
      a model for assessing dependability issues in these environments. For the purposes
      of this paper we consider assistive technologies to be software-controlled networks
      of assistive devices. Clearly a home is a personal concept and a social construction,
      which imbues different meanings to each individual through social actions and
      the assignment of meaning to those actions. It is therefore important that any
      method of investigation is sensitive to the changing meanings and nature of
      people''s conceptions of home. This paper outlines the fundamental concepts
      used by the Lancaster team and proposes a method of conceptualizing dependability
      within a home context. This paper suggests that the design of AT involves a
      number of factors that can be derived from a number of sources but essentially
      all design should place the user at the centre of the process. We aim to show
      that the home is different from the standard organization and as such deserves
      consideration in its own right and technology systems need to meet certain criteria
      within domestic situations that are not covered within traditional organizations.
      We extend this notion by considering the use of A T in terms of previous models
      of design and assessment. We also acknowledge that older people are not a homogenous
      category, and that designing for a group requires sensitivity to the individual
      needs of the person rather than the categorization of the person. We then consider
      the role of systems development and deployment from the perspective of designing
      AT systems for older people and this brings us to consider the problems that
      are associated with dependability. We contend that standard dependability analysis
      falls short of the full picture of analysis when applied to domestic settings.",

      "title": "Composing Dynamic Hyperslices", "abstract": "Abstract. This paper
      describes a composition mechanism for the dynamic hyperslices model outlined
      in [1]. This mechanism composes primary concerns, directly aligned with requirements
      and designs (decomposed in accordance with the Hyperspaces approach), maintaining
      each concern unchanged as a first class entity all through its lifetime. Consequently
      this mechanism allows for dynamic change and re-configureability of the resultant
      systems. 1. Introduction Recent work in the field of Software Engineering has
      resulted in a set of approaches collectively termed Aspect-Oriented (AO) Techniques
      [2]. AO introduces yet another level of decomposition: separation of crosscutting
      properties in software, and brings to light the notion of concern . A primary
      concern \u2013 a matter of interest in a software system that cannot be decomposed
      into smaller meaningful parts, can now be identified as the atomic unit of any
      software artefact 1 . It has been shown that it is the inappropriate separation
      of these concerns [3] that results in monolithic designs [4] and code, which
      are difficult to understand, maintain and reuse. Some research has already been
      carried out on modelling concerns [5], mapping them to design [6] and implementation
      units [7]. Our work on the Dynamic Hyperslices model [1] follows this line of
      research, aiming to preserve the unchanged primary concerns as first class entities
      all through the life cycle of software that concerns form part of \u2013 from
      concern modelling to software run-time. This path leads to flexibility in concern
      manipulation, reuse and maintenance, as well as dynamic change and re-configureability
      of the resultant systems. However it shifts the complexity of development and
      maintenance into concern composition. In view of the increasing importance of
      composition, we have proposed [1] to distinguish it as a separate", "venue":

      the RE community. Ethnographic studies have been used in particular to inform
      the requirements process from a social perspective. To make this accessible
      to requirements engineers, work in this area has focused on how to integrate
      and communicate ethnographic findings on a per project basis but scant attention
      has been paid to how findings from individual studies may be generalised and

      our resource of Patterns of Cooperative Interaction to the RE community. These
      patterns specifically compare and contrast a variety of ethnographic findings,
      discuss their relevance to design and provide an introduction to the analytic
      sensibilities of such studies. We discuss how we developed patterns of interaction
      from a corpus of ethnographic studies, illustrate a selection of these patterns
      and suggest how the patterns collection can be used by requirements engineers

      "title": "Managing Stakeholder Requirements in High Performance Computing Procurement",
      "abstract": "High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities are provided in the
      UK at a national level. These facilities are amongst the best in the world,
      supporting world class research across a spectrum of disciplines. EPSRC has
      led the procurement of the two current facilities: CSAR (Computing Services
      for Academic Research) which was implemented in 1998, and HPCx which was implemented
      in 2001. In this paper we consider the issues involved in HPC procurement and
      present recommendations for managing stakeholder requirements in future procurements
      of national HPC facilities. These recommendations are organised as a process,
      of which the top level is presented here. The process takes an iterative, \u2018spiral\u2019
      approach affording rounds of eliciting, balancing and validating requirements.
      Previous procurements have been successful, but with the increasing costs of
      HPC, an increasing effort must be made to ensure that this remains so. Our focus
      here is on how stakeholders, particularly within the academic scientific community,
      can be better involved in the decision making processes and ultimately how procurement
      strategy can rigorously meet the demands of the potential users.", "venue":

      "title": "Appropriate Home Technology: Depending on Dependable Technology Systems",
      "abstract": "Dwelling with computers, they become part of the informing environment,
      like weather, like street sounds. A house that is true to its house nature must
      have a certain quiet, even stolidness. Through a thousand subtle cues, computers
      will help turn our houses into homes. Weiser (1996) This paper is interested
      in explicating some of the multiple concerns involved in designing appropriate
      technology in domestic, or home, settings. As society becomes increasingly reliant
      on computer-based systems, and as domestic settings become increasingly technologised,
      the systems themselves have become increasingly complex and the need for dependable
      systems correspondingly important. Achieving sufficient dependability in these
      systems, and demonstrating this achievement in a rigorous and convincing manner,
      appears crucial in moving towards an inclusive Information Society. The paper
      reflects our interest in making some initial steps towards developing improved
      means of specifying, designing, assessing, deploying and maintaining complex
      socio-technical systems in domestic contexts where high dependability is crucial.
      As computer-based systems and artefacts penetrate more and more into people\u2019s
      everyday lives and homes, the \u2018design problem\u2019 is not so much concerned
      with the creation of new technical artefacts as it is with their effective and
      dependable configuration and integration. It is evident that satisfactory resolution
      of such concerns demands major, interdisciplinary breakthroughs in understanding
      the development of complex socio-technical systems in domestic environments
      since inadequate understanding of the context of the lived reality of use and
      user needs is often a significant cause of lack of dependability. The paper
      also explores the ongoing DIRC project which is currently investigating these
      areas within its Project Activity \u2018Dependable Ubiquitous Computing In The
      Home\u2019. While this paper does not attempt to solve all of the presented
      issues it aims to illuminate and highlight some fields of investigation that
      might form the basis for future and ongoing research and development agendas
      for appropriate technological interventions in domestic settings", "venue":

      "title": "A Process and Tool for Negotiating and Structuring Upstream Requirement
      Definition", "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of eliciting requirements
      for large scale technical systems with multiple stakeholders, significant technological
      uncertainties and extended time scales. Attention needs to be paid to conflicting
      organisational objectives and hidden agendas. For various reasons, it is important
      that people agree on the problem the system is meant to help with. Many existing
      RE techniques try to reconcile conflicting requirements after eliciting them.
      We argue that negotiation over conflicting requirements can productively occur
      during their elicitation. Hence our focus is on the early, \u2019upstream\u2019
      stage when options and commitment are just beginning to emerge. Decisions made
      at this point often have profound and unanticipated consequences for the future
      of such systems. The dynamism of contemporary organisations and the short attention-spans
      of management suggests that requirement engineering techniques need to be lightweight
      and distributed. Drawing both on problem structuring methods found in management
      science and on design rationale techniques, we have developed a hybrid process
      and accompanying software tool support to facilitate consensual problem definition.
      Negotiation occurs through a combination of informal group problem structuring
      (cognitive mapping) and incremental formalisation (design rationale) of requirements.
      Field trials indicate that parts of the negotiation can be conducted asynchronously,
      others require group work with a facilitator. The Wisdom process-tool is currently
      being tested in the domain of high performance computing (HPC) procurement.",

      "title": "Designing Appropriate Assistive Technology for Home Users: Developing
      dependable networks", "abstract": "This paper is concerned with explicating
      some of the multiple concerns involved in designing appropriate assistive technology
      in domestic, or home, settings. As society becomes increasingly reliant on computer-based
      systems, and as domestic settings become increasingly technologised (Dewsbury
      2001), the systems themselves have become increasingly complex and the need
      for dependable systems correspondingly important. Achieving sufficient dependability
      in these systems, and demonstrating this achievement in a rigorous and convincing
      manner, appears crucial in moving towards an inclusive Information Society.
      The paper reflects our interest in making some initial steps towards developing
      improved means of specifying, designing, assessing, deploying and maintaining
      complex socio-technical systems in domestic contexts where high dependability
      is crucial. As computer-based systems and artefacts penetrate more and more
      into people\u2019s everyday lives and homes, the \u2018design problem\u2019
      is not so much concerned with the creation of new technical artefacts as it
      is with their effective and dependable configuration and integration. It is
      evident that satisfactory resolution of such concerns demands major, interdisciplinary
      breakthroughs in understanding the development of complex socio-technical systems
      in domestic environments since inadequate understanding of the context of the
      lived reality of use and user needs is often a significant cause of lack of
      dependability. The paper also explores the ongoing DIRC project that, currently,
      is ethnographically investigating these areas within its Project Activity \u2018Dependable
      Ubiquitous Computing In The Home\u2019. Whilst this paper does not attempt to
      solve all of the presented issues it does aim to illuminate some fields of investigation
      that might form the basis for future and ongoing research and development agendas
      for appropriate technological interventions in domestic settings.", "venue":

      "title": "Ethnographically informed analysis for software engineers", "abstract":
      "It is increasingly recognized that human, social, and political factors have
      a significant impact on software systems design. To address this, ethnographic
      studies of work have been used to inform the systems design process, especially
      in cooperative work settings where systems support several users working together.
      Based on our experience of these studies, we have investigated the integration
      of social analysis into the systems design process by developing an integrated
      approach to social and object-oriented analysis. New methods are unlikely to
      be adopted in industry unless they can be integrated with existing practice.
      Our approach, called Coherence, addresses this issue by helping identify use
      cases, generating initial use case models, and by using the Unified Modelling
      Language (UML) to represent social aspects of work that may have an impact on
      the design of computer-based systems. Coherence is the fusion of two well-established
      strands of research on ethnographically informed design and viewpoint-oriented
      requirements engineering. This paper introduces Coherence, and focuses on the
      support provided for social analysis. We have identified three social viewpoints,
      namely a distributed coordination viewpoint, a plans and procedures viewpoint
      and an awareness of work viewpoint. Coherence is illustrated using a case study
      based on an air traffic control system.", "venue": "Int. J. Hum. Comput. Stud.",

      concerned with how to represent in system design the kinds of features of work
      settings as reported by ethnographic studies of work. Various researchers and
      practitioners have found that ethnomethodological analyses of work settings
      can provide useful insights to the work processes and settings that system design
      is interested in. Previously at Lancaster, we have examined ways in which ethnography
      can be used in the design process, and how the results of ethnographic analyses
      can be presented in such a way as to be useful components of the design process.
      This paper reflects an effort to approach these methodological issues from a
      different perspective, by examining how the lessons learned from ethnographic
      studies can be reflected in the design process itself, and in particular how
      design artefacts (models, documents, etc.) can express the type of information
      which ethnographic studies produce. This paper is concerned with how to represent
      in system design the kinds of features of work settings as reported by ethnographic
      studies of work. Various researchers and practitioners have found that ethnomethodological
      analyses of work settings can provide useful insights to the work processes
      and settings that system design is interested in. Previously at Lancaster, we

      the notion of software process inconsistency and suggests that inconsistencies
      in software processes are inevitable and sometimes desirable. We present an
      approach to process analysis that helps discover different perceptions of a
      software process and that supports the discovery of process inconsistencies
      and process improvements stimulated by these inconsistencies. By analogy with
      viewpoints for requirements engineering that allow multiple perspectives on
      a software system specification to be managed, we have developed the notion
      of process viewpoints that provide multi-perspective descriptions of software
      processes. A process viewpoint includes a statement of focus or \"world view\",
      a set of sources of process information, a process description and a set of
      organizational concerns that represent goals or constraints on the process analysis.
      We present a description and rationale of process viewpoints, discuss the process
      of applying process viewpoints for process understanding, and illustrate the
      overall approach using part of a case study drawn from industrial processes

      Issues", "abstract": "A common thread in recent discussions of organisational
      change is the importance of the role allocated to information technology in
      the realisation of such change. It is a feature of many of these discussions
      that IT is handled in a somewhat simplistic fashion, often with a pronounced
      theoretical leaning resulting in \u201cthe case of the disappearing technology\u201d.
      Even empirical studies of new technology often fail to pay attention to the
      actual details of technology in use, instead focusing upon the part technology
      might play in producing certain managerial or workplace configurations that
      are themselves theoretical renderings of organisational life. By way of contrast,
      this paper presents some results from a long-term empirical investigation of
      computer systems in use in financial services that specifically aims to focus
      upon the actual details of technology in use. In addition it attempts to address
      conventional concerns with the relationship between new technology and \u2018skill\u2019,

      Engineering Processes and Techniques Why this book was written The value of
      introducing requirements engineering to trainee software engineers is to equip
      them for the real world of software and systems development. What is involved
      in Requirements Engineering? As a discipline, newly emerging from software engineering,
      there are a range of views on where requirements engineering starts and finishes
      and what it should encompass. This book offers the most comprehensive coverage
      of the requirements engineering process to date - from initial requirements
      elicitation through to requirements validation. How and Which methods and techniques
      should you use? As there is no one catch-all technique applicable to all types
      of system, requirements engineers need to know about a range of different techniques.
      Tried and tested techniques such as data-flow and object-oriented models are
      covered as well as some promising new ones. They are all based on real systems
      descriptions to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. Who should read
      it? Principally written for senior undergraduate and graduate students studying
      computer science, software engineering or systems engineering, this text will
      also be helpful for those in industry new to requirements engineering. Accompanying

      "Legacy systems are usually critical to the business in which they operate,
      but the costs of running them are often not justifiable. Determining whether
      such systems are worth keeping requires an overall assessment of the system.
      We present an assessment method that examines a legacy system from its technical,
      business and organisational perspectives. The method guides users through assessment
      of these perspectives by selecting assessment characteristics and assigning
      values to them. The method provides further guidance on interpreting the results
      obtained from assessment. Our assessment method can be tailored to the needs
      of particular evolution projects and organisations. It is not prescriptive of
      particular tools and techniques, and can be instantiated to offer a cost/risk
      trade-off. Quick estimates can be derived from performing the method at a high
      level. The risk of producing an inaccurate assessment can be reduced by further
      iterations of the method performed at more detailed levels.", "venue": "Proceedings

      "title": "Coherence : Social Analysis for Software Engineers", "abstract": "It
      is increasingly recognised that human, social, and political factors have a
      significant impact on software system design. To address this, ethnographic
      studies of work have been used to inform the system design process, especially
      in cooperative work settings where systems support several users working together.
      Based on our experience of these studies, we have investigated the integration
      of social analysis into the system design process. This paper introduces a method
      that provides support for social analysis and which has been designed for use
      alongside other approaches to system requirements analysis. New methods are
      unlikely to be adopted in industry unless they are capable of being integrated
      with existing practice. Our approach addresses this issue by helping identify
      use cases, generating initial use case models, and by using UML to represent
      social aspects of work that may have an impact on the design of computer based
      systems. This paper introduces the approach, and focuses on the support provided
      for social analysis. We have identified three social viewpoints, namely a distributed
      coordination viewpoint, a plans and procedures viewpoint and an awareness of
      work viewpoint. We illustrate our approach using a case study based on an air
      traffic control system.", "venue": "", "year": 1998, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount":

      the Publisher: \nRequirements engineering is the process of discovering, documenting
      and managing the requirements for a computer-based system. The goal of requirements
      engineering is to produce a set of system requirements which, as far as possible,
      is complete, consistent, relevant and reflects what the customer actually wants.
      Although this ideal is probably unattainable, the use of a systematic approach
      based on engineering principles leads to better requirements than the informal
      approach which is still commonly used. This book presents a set of guidelines
      which reflect the best practice in requirements engineering. Based on the authors''
      experience in research and in software and systems development, these guidelines
      explain in an easy-to-understand way how you can improve your requirements engineering
      processes. The guidelines are applicable for any type of application and, in
      general, apply to both systems and software engineering.", "venue": "", "year":

      "Viewpoint oriented verification and validation (VOCAL) is a novel technique
      for the identification and application of a structured life-cycle based software
      testing process to a broad array of systems. Application of the technique can
      be specfically tailored to embedded, interactive and multimedia applications,
      as well as those systems requiring a well defined approach in the quality assurance
      process. The authors introduce an approach for performance enhancement during
      the testing process. Problems faced when constructing software systems in time-constrained,
      market-driven development processes are highlighted. Emphasis is given to test
      process improvements by stressing some of the \u2018failures\u2019 encountered
      when using traditional test models. Traditionally, testing follows the stages
      of specify, develop, test and release in a standard waterfall based approach.
      The use of viewpoints will be introduced as a technique for structuring, identification,
      organisation and deployment of test information. Finally, the method is illustrated
      with a small example using a bank ATM machine. In conclusion, the authors evaluate
      VOCAL, and outline areas of future work.", "venue": "IEE Proceedings - Software

      pay little attention to requirements engineering. Typically, requirements engineering
      is considered to be a single activity in the overall development process. Even
      where this is not strictly the case, the requirements activities are not elaborated
      in sufficient detail to permit the derivation of an improvement plan. This is
      unfortunate because requirements engineering is increasingly recognized as a
      problem. Despite the regular improvement of techniques for eliciting, analysing,
      validating and managing requirements, even otherwise mature organizations repeatedly
      experience requirements problems. This paper describes a good practice-based
      approach to requirements engineering process improvement which aims to fill
      the gap left by existing process improvement methods. This distils practical
      information from over 60 requirements practices and provides a framework to
      help organizations identify their problem areas and deploy the practices most

      "title": "Software process models", "abstract": "(1) Specification. The functionality
      of the software and its operating constraints are specified in detail. (2) Design
      and implementation. The overall structure of the software is designed and specific
      software components identified. These are implemented using some programming
      language, often by separate individuals or teams. (3) Integration and testing.
      Individually developed modules are integrated into a complete system and tested.
      (4) Operation and maintenance. The software is delivered to the customer and
      modified to meet changing requirements and to repair errors discovered in use.
      The problem with this model is the lack of feedback from one stage to another.
      Specification, design, and implementation problems are often discovered only
      after implementation when the system has been integrated. Once a specification
      has been frozen, it is difficult to change in response to changing user needs.
      However, stakeholders in the system (end-users, managers, and so on) find it
      difficult to anticipate their real needs for software support, and both organizational
      and end-user requirements change during the development process. There is therefore
      a constant pressure for specification change. This means that, in practice,
      there is always some iteration between the phases of the model, but this is
      invariably fairly limited and the delivered software may not meet the real needs
      of the customer. This led to widespread criticism of the waterfall model [Gladden
      1982; McCracken and Jackson 1982] and the development of alternative software
      processes. Incremental models [Mills et al. 1980] are a development of the waterfall
      model that attempt to provide some development stability while allowing users
      some opportunity for specification change. In this approach, the system functionality
      is partitioned into a series of increments and these are developed and delivered
      one by one. While one increment is being developed, its specification is frozen,
      but the specification of other increments may change. A version of the system
      is delivered early to users and they may experiment with it to help clarify
      their needs for later system increments.", "venue": "CSUR", "year": 1996, "referenceCount":

      (mostly) showed an awareness of industrial needs and there were several good
      industrial presentations which reported positive experiences with introducing
      SCM and SCM technology. The workshop was supplemented by demonstrat ions of

      "abstract": "Our approach to dynamic configuration is based on building a model
      of reconfigurable applications. The model documents applications according to
      the configuration paradigm and for each component, captures structural constraints
      and behavioural information. The model presents change administrators with an
      abstract interface to dynamic configuration management. Change is initiated
      by submitting a version descriptor to the configuration manager; much of the
      low-level and error-prone activities of dynamic configuration are automated.
      Synchronisation of dynamic configuration with the application and management
      of persistent state are fundamental to preserving an application''s integrity.
      We present our synchronisation mechanism, which adopts atomic operations for
      both intra- and inter-component computation. The problems of persistent state
      management are simplified by our synchronisation model. We also expose the difficulties
      and propose solutions for managing composite components and components whose
      operations are constrained.", "venue": "Proceedings of International Conference

      engineering process involves a clear understanding of the requirements of the
      intended system. This includes the services required of the system, the system

      capture, analysis and resolution of many ideas, perspectives and relationships

      appear to lack the expressive framework to adequately articulate this distributed
      requirementsknowledge structure. The paper describes the problems in trying
      to establish an adequate and stable set of requirements and proposes a viewpoint-oriented
      requirements definition (VORD) method as a means of tackling some of these problems.
      This method structures the requirements engineering process using viewpoints
      associated with sources of requirements. The paper describes VORD in the light
      of current viewpoint-oriented requirements approaches and shows how it improves
      on them. A simple example of a bank auto-teller system is used to demonstrate

      "Computer support for cooperative work requires the construction of applications
      that support interaction by multiple users. The highly dynamic and flexible
      nature of cooperative work makes the need for rapid user-interface prototyping
      a central concern. We have designed and developed a software architecture that
      provides mechanisms to support rapid multiuser-interface construction and distributed
      user-interface management. Rapid prototyping requires mechanisms that make the
      information determining interface configuration visible, accessible, and tailorable.
      We developed the architecture as part of a project investigating support for
      the cooperative work of air traffic controllers. Extensive use of prolonged
      ethnographic investigation helped to uncover the nature of cooperation in air
      traffic control. The aim of the architecture is to support an environment in
      which a multidisciplinary team can experiment with a wide range of alternate
      user-interface designs for air traffic controllers. Thus, we use examples from
      this domain to illustrate the architecture.<<ETX>>", "venue": "Computer", "year":

      exist a number of CASE tools to support software re-engineering in several different
      languages. These tools automatically or semi-automatically analyse a system''s
      structure and re-structure that system into a more coherent form. However, the
      recovered structure is a control structure at a fine-level of detail. It is
      not possible to recover a more abstract architectural structure by source code
      processing. By architectural structure, we mean a more abstract model showing
      the principal sub-systems and modules making up the system, their interfaces,
      their composition relationships and other relevant inter-module relationships
      such as data flows. We argue that the discovery of this architectural structure
      is a critical part of the re-engineering process. We have developed a language,
      called PCL (Proteus Configuration Language), which is specifically intended
      for the architectural modelling of systems at an abstract level. The language
      allows the construction of hardware, software and documentation models and provides
      relationship definition facilities which can link these models. The systems
      described may be centralised or distributed, homogeneous or heterogeneous. PCL
      addresses the problem of architectural variability so that the architectural
      descriptions of different system versions may be combined into a single model.

      "Summary form only given. The authors describe facilities which have been included
      in a configuration language called PCL to support the process of system installation.
      PCL is used to support the installation of two classes of distributed system.
      These are distributed applications where a single, ''logical'' system is structured
      as a set of processes which may execute concurrently on separate processors
      and multi-copy applications where the same system is installed on several different
      nodes in a network. PCL can describe both hardware and software systems. This
      has allowed the authors to extend the language with a description of constraints
      on system installation and with facilities for specifying where particular software
      is to be installed. They use a special purpose installation tool (PCL-Install)
      to interpret installation instructions. The advantages of this approach are
      that installation procedures are easy to write and understand, the installation
      framework for a family of related systems can be defined and the model provides
      support for installation across heterogeneous networks.<<ETX>>", "venue": "Proceedings

      an analysis of that process from a social perspective and the development of
      a prototype user interface for air traffic controllers\u2019 interaction with
      a flight information system. As part of the analysis process, sociologists were
      involved in ethnographic studies of work and discovered subtle and complex patterns
      of cooperation which, we suspect, would not have been discovered using structured
      methods for requirements analysis. From a software development perspective,
      we describe how the input from the sociologists was essential for understanding
      the real automation requirements, discuss the difficulties of inter-disciplinary
      cooperative working and suggest how social analysis can be integrated in the

      model of a centrifugal hydraulic pump, which is being used in the implementation
      of an object-oriented intelligent CAD system. Finally, conclusions on the suitability

      "A discussion is given on a system modelling language and supporting toolkit
      which was originally developed as part of the Eclipse software engineering environment.
      The authors address the modelling of large-scale systems made up of many different
      types of components. The language, called SySL (system structure language),
      enables system structure to be described at various levels of abstraction. A
      toolkit enables changes to the system descriptions to be made consistently,
      and automates the process of building an executable version of the described
      system. Using such a language and toolkit, a systems administrator can control
      the process of dynamically re-configuring a system in a much more effective
      way. SySL was developed in the first place to support the management of software
      configurations. The authors have extended the system and are using it in a project
      investigating the general problems of distributed systems management (G. Dean
      et al., 1992). The language is also the basis for the configuration language
      in a European collaborative project which is concerned with providing practical
      support for dynamic systems evolution. The authors describe some of the features
      of SySL and illustrate how the language can be used for system configuration
      specification using an example of a network of workstations. They then describe
      the toolkit which has been developed to support software configuration management
      using SySL and initial work on the use of the language in conjunction with a
      dynamic configuration manager.<\n >", "venue": "International Workshop on Configurable

      being used in a project which is looking at the electronic display of information
      in ATC. This project is novel in that requirements for such displays are being
      informed by an ethnographic study which has been performed at the London Air
      Traffic Control Centre (LATCC). Insights provided by this study regarding the
      nature of the teamwork in ATC have led the system developers to question some
      conventional assumptions regarding computer systems design. A generator system
      called MEAD has been developed which specifically addresses the problems of
      creating and managing the kinds of multi-user interfaces found in cooperative
      domains like ATC. The system provides high level tools for the rapid prototyping
      and refinement of electronic displays as well as a run-time architecture which
      allows these displays to be evaluated in cooperative environments.", "venue":

      entity representations and the way in which these representations are presented
      to specific controllers. The advantages of this model are that it allows multiple
      database views to be updated concurrently, it allows views to be shared by users

      system must meet both its functional and non-functional system requirements.
      A reliable real-time software system is not only a logically correct system
      but is a system which guarantees all of its timing constraints. Realtime software
      tools can, therefore, enhance the quality of the software by providing timing
      information earlier in the development cycle. The tool SRT (Simulation of Real-Time

      The design can be assessed, evaluated and automatically converted to the less
      flexible notation used in design methods for detailed development. The system
      is not restricted to any particular method; it allows methods to be defined

      "title": "Configuration management using SySL", "abstract": "Software configuration
      management is concerned primarily with the consistent labelling and tracking
      of project information and managing change to that information [l]. Its objective
      is to try and control the changes that are made to the software in such a way
      as to preserve the integrity of the system and provide a basis on which to measure
      quality, both of the system and the development process. Initially, software
      configuration management systems were aimed at the results of the software life-cycle
      itself ( i.e. software components ) without trying to manage other outputs from
      the various stages in the process. Systems such as Make [2] and SCCS [3] are
      indicative of such an approach. However recent research has recognised that
      software configuration management should be applied throughout the software
      process. Therefore information such as design diagrams, requirements documents,
      test data, etc, as well as code, should be under the control of the configuration
      management system. System modelling lies at the heart of software configuration
      management. The system model captures the state of the system, identifies the
      parts making up the system and specifies how to put these components together.
      To provide features such as the identification of baselines, the system model
      must capture the process by which the system is constructed, the identifiable
      pieces of information which emerge during the development process and their
      relationships. There are many dimensions to system modelling identified in [4].",

      support environments (IPSEs) are intended to provide a cohesive and integrated
      set of tools to support the process of design and development in software engineering
      projects. Much current research is concentrated on maximising the degree to
      which these tools can be integrated. This paper briefly describes the architecture
      of a prototype IPSE which attempts to achieve a high degree of integration using
      techniques drawn from the disciplines of intelligent knowledge-based systems,
      office automation and object-oriented programming. The remainder of the paper
      deals with the design of a user interface to the IPSE based on direct manipulation.
      It argues that this provides a consistent and integrated method with which users
      can interact with the objects in the IPSE''s object store.", "venue": "Software

      form only given, as follows. The author presents a general overview of the place
      of user interface systems in the current generation of IPSEs and suggests that
      the current approach is ad hoc and not based on any systematic analysis of user
      requirements. As far as has been reported, none of the existing IPSEs have designed
      their user interfaces from any kind of analysis of software engineering activities.
      He then discusses what are the key issues and requirements in the design of
      IPSE user interfaces, in particular the management of complexity, and suggest
      how appropriate solutions should be discovered. It is particularly important
      that the developers of IPSE user interfaces export their technology to IPSE
      users. There are clear technical and organisational difficulties in establishing
      IPSE UI requirements and these are discussed.", "venue": "", "year": 1988, "referenceCount":

      "This paper describes an information retrieval system which is specifically
      designed to be used for storing and retrieving information about software components.
      Rather than use a retrieval mechanism which is simply based on keyword descriptions,
      we have made use of developments in natural language research to represent component
      information in a form which encodes semantics as well as syntax. We call this
      the component descriptor frame. The paper describes the basic ideas which underlie
      our system and describes how it can be used for component information retrieval.
      An example of the system in use is presented. The version of the system described
      here has been fully implemented and is now being developed as part of a more
      general reuse support system.", "venue": "SIGF", "year": 1988, "referenceCount":

      Milan Polytechnic in Italy on the use of structured light for object recognition.
      It is the computational simplicity of this type of technique which augurs well
      for the future. A major section of the book is devoted to developments in weld-guiding
      systems and notable here is a report on the work done at Oxford University on
      visual feedback for arc-welding of thin sheet steel. Useful results have been
      obtained in this area with both T-joins, and lap-joins to within 0.3 millimetres
      have been reported with some confidence. A further section of the book is devoted
      to developments in assembly and part presentation. Amongst these papers there
      is a report on the classical work on bin picking at the University of Rhode
      Island in the USA and a description of the flexible assembly work carried out
      at the Production Engineering Research Association in the UK. The latter is
      a good example of the way in which vision may be used away from robot manipulator
      arms, in the context of older tools of the trade; bowl feeders. A section on
      application describes varied work ranging from vision systems for the sorting
      of castings at General Motors in Canada to the automatic decoration of chocolates
      by means of a robot at Patscentre International in the UK. The book ends with
      a useful group of papers on commercially available vision systems from the major
      manufacturers in the USA and Germany. The only criticism one might make of the
      book is that some the papers report on work which has been done several years
      ago. It would be a pity if the reader were left with the impression that progress
      has not taken place since that time. On the whole, however, the book is recommended
      to anyone who wishes to take robot vision seriously.", "venue": "Robotica (Cambridge.

      Architectures", "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative approach to
      improving service availability and reliability. Central to the approach taken
      are what we call fault tolerant service containers. These \u2018contain\u2019
      externally provided services and in doing so add fault tolerance to them. This
      is achieved by allowing the container to be configured with a policy which specifies
      what kind of fault tolerance mechanisms may be applied to the services it contains.
      The container proxies calls to its services, passing them on to replicas in
      a pattern determined by the specified policy. A tool and SDK simplify the creation
      and deployment of the container and its policy. We conclude that, as it stands,
      this architecture provides a consistent mechanism for achieving certain kinds
      of fault tolerance. As demonstrated by the astronomical ephemeris application
      discussed herein, this also requires minimal effort from the developer. Furthermore,
      the extensible nature of this architecture means that its users can complement
      and extend the set of fault tolerance mechanisms already imple-", "venue": "",
