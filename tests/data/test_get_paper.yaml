      application of Turing\u2019s Imitation Game", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence
      (AI) technology, such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT),
      is evolving quickly and having a significant impact on the higher education
      sector. Although the impact of ChatGPT on academic integrity processes is a
      key concern, little is known about whether academics can reliably recognise
      texts that have been generated by AI. This qualitative study applies Turing\u2019s
      Imitation Game to investigate 16 education academics\u2019 perceptions of two
      pairs of texts written by either ChatGPT or a human. Pairs of texts, written
      in response to the same task, were used as the stimulus for interviews that
      probed academics\u2019 perceptions of text authorship and the textual features
      that were important in their decision-making. Results indicated academics were
      only able to identify AI-generated texts half of the time, highlighting the
      sophistication of contemporary generative AI technology. Academics perceived
      the following categories as important for their decision-making: voice, word
      usage, structure, task achievement and flow. All five categories of decision-making
      were variously used to rationalise both accurate and inaccurate decisions about
      text authorship. The implications of these results are discussed with a particular
      focus on what strategies can be applied to support academics more effectively
      as they manage the ongoing challenge of AI in higher education.\nImplications
      for practice or policy:\n\nExperienced academics may be unable to distinguish
      between texts written by contemporary generative AI technology and humans.\nAcademics
      are uncertain about the current capabilities of generative AI and need support
      in redesigning assessments that succeed in providing robust evidence of student
      achievement of learning outcomes.\nInstitutions must assess the adequacy of
      their assessment designs, AI use policies, and AI-related procedures to enhance
      students\u2019 capacity for effective and ethical use of generative AI technology.\n",

      as subjective decision making, creative imagining and remedy for the unforeseen",
      "abstract": "Abstract Little historical work examines the problems, practices
      and values of \u2018machine learning\u2019 as it was understood and justified
      within pattern recognition research communities prior to the 1980s. This omission
      has led to a failure to appreciate how the efficacy of machine learning was
      often justified by its perceived capacity for \u2018originality\u2019 rooted
      in machine (and human) subjectivity. This paper examines why and how early 1950s
      pattern recognition researchers came to see \u2018machine learning\u2019 as
      a technical and epistemological set of nominalist strategies for performing
      induction and abduction given incomplete, complex or contradictory information
      that might also spur \u2018creative\u2019 insight in such diverse activities
      as political judgement and scientific inquiry. I document local research problems,
      epistemological commitments, institutional contexts and the circulation of \u2018machine-learning\u2019
      practices and values through three cases of early-career researchers imagining,
      building and programming digital computers to \u2018learn\u2019 from 1950 to
      1953. This machine learning implemented in learning programs came to be seen
      by some researchers as more efficacious descriptions of the natural and social
      world because these descriptions were perspective-dependent, profoundly contingent
      and contextually non-exhaustive. Often indexed as colloquial appeals to greater
      \u2018generality\u2019, conceptions of machine learning''s efficacy as the capacity
      to make meaning from contradictory information continues to inform contemporary
      debates regarding artificial intelligence, society and possibility.", "venue":

      Age of Artificial Intelligence", "abstract": "Following the success of deep
      learning (DL) in research, we are now witnessing the fast and widespread adoption
      of artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life, influencing the way we act, think,
      and organize our lives. However, much still remains a mystery when it comes
      to how these systems achieve such high performance and why they reach the outputs
      they do. This presents us with an unusual combination: of technical mastery
      on the one hand, and a striking degree of mystery on the other. This conjunction
      is not only fascinating, but it also poses considerable risks, which urgently
      require our attention. Awareness of the need to analyze ethical implications,
      such as fairness, equality, and sustainability, is growing. However, other dimensions
      of inquiry receive less attention, including the subtle but pervasive ways in
      which our dealings with AI shape our way of living and thinking, transforming
      our culture and human self-understanding. If we want to deploy AI positively
      in the long term, a broader and more holistic assessment of the technology is
      vital, involving not only scientific and technical perspectives, but also those
      from the humanities. To this end, we present outlines of a work program for
      the humanities that aim to contribute to assessing and guiding the potential,
      opportunities, and risks of further developing and deploying DL systems. This
      paper contains a thematic introduction (Sect.\u00a01), an introduction to the
      workings of DL for non-technical readers (Sect.\u00a02), and a main part, containing
      the outlines of a work program for the humanities (Sect.\u00a03). Readers familiar
      with DL might want to ignore 2 and instead directly read 3 after 1.", "venue":

      Adoption of ChatGPT\u201d, was developed by integrating the theoretical foundations
      of both the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Status Quo
      Bias (SQB) frameworks, as well as insights gathered from interviews. The relationships
      within this model were then tested using a quantitative approach. The partial
      least squares-structural equation modelling method was used to analyse 243 valid
      survey responses.\n\n\nFindings\nThe outcomes of the analysis indicated that
      perceived educators\u2019 effort expectancy, educators\u2019 autonomous motivation,
      perceived learners\u2019 AI competency, perceived educators\u2019 competency,
      innovative behaviour towards technological agility and perceived students\u2019
      engagement are significant determinants of educators\u2019 intention to use
      chatbots. In contrast, perceived unfair evaluation of students, perceived students\u2019
      overreliance and perceived bias/inaccuracies were shown to have significant
      impacts on the resistance to use the technology, which typically implies a negatively
      significant influence on the educators\u2019 use intention. Interestingly, perceived
      fraudulent use of ChatGPT was proven insignificant on the resistance to use
      chatbots.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study makes a significant contribution
      to the field of educational technology by filling the gap in research on the
      use and acceptance of AI-enabled assistants in education. It proposes an original,
      empirically validated model of educator adoption, which identifies the factors
      that influence educators\u2019 willingness to use chatbots in higher education
      and offers valuable insights for practical implementation.\n", "venue": "Interactive

      Artificial Intelligence Testing and Alignment", "abstract": "This paper explores
      the potential of a multidisciplinary approach to testing and aligning artificial
      general intelligence (AGI) and LLMs. Due to the rapid development and wide application
      of LLMs, challenges such as ethical alignment, controllability, and predictability
      of these models have become important research topics. This study investigates
      an innovative simulation-based multi-agent system within a virtual reality framework
      that replicates the real-world environment. The framework is populated by automated
      ''digital citizens,'' simulating complex social structures and interactions
      to examine and optimize AGI. Application of various theories from the fields
      of sociology, social psychology, computer science, physics, biology, and economics
      demonstrates the possibility of a more human-aligned and socially responsible
      AGI. The purpose of such a digital environment is to provide a dynamic platform
      where advanced AI agents can interact and make independent decisions, thereby
      mimicking realistic scenarios. The actors in this digital city, operated by
      the LLMs, serve as the primary agents, exhibiting high degrees of autonomy.
      While this approach shows immense potential, there are notable challenges and
      limitations, most significantly the unpredictable nature of real-world social
      dynamics. This research endeavors to contribute to the development and refinement
      of AGI, emphasizing the integration of social, ethical, and theoretical dimensions
      for future research.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 118, "citationCount":

      was developed to identify artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities and challenges
      in higher education.Design/methodology/approachThis qualitative research was
      developed using the six-step thematic analysis method (Braun and Clark, 2006).
      Participants in this study were AI PhD students from Tehran University in 2022\u20132023.
      Purposive sampling was used to select the participants; a total of 15 AI PhD
      students, who were experts in this field, were selected and interviews were
      conducted.FindingsThe authors considered the opportunities that AI creates for
      higher education in eight secondary subthemes (for faculty members, for students,
      in the teaching and learning process, for assessment, the development of educational
      structures, the development of research structures, the development of management
      structures and the development of academic culture). Correspondingly, The authors
      identified and categorized the challenges that AI creates for higher education.Research
      limitations/implicationsConcerning the intended research, several limitations
      are significant. First, the statistical population was limited, and only people
      with characteristics such as being PhD students, studying at Tehran University
      and being experts in AI could be considered the statistical population. Second,
      caution should be exercised when generalizing the results due to the limited
      statistical population (PhD students from Tehran University). Third, the problem
      of accessing some students due to their participation in research grants, academic
      immigration, etc.Originality/valueThe innovation of the current research is
      that the authors identified the opportunities and challenges that AI creates
      for higher education at different levels. The findings of this study also contribute
      to the enrichment of existing knowledge in the field regarding the effects of
      AI on the future of higher education, as researchers need more understanding
      of AI developments in the future of higher education.", "venue": "Journal of

      agents (CAs) with emerging artificial intelligence present new opportunities
      to assist in health interventions but are difficult to evaluate, deterring their
      applications in the real world. We aimed to synthesize existing evidence and
      knowledge and outline an evaluation framework for CA interventions.\n\n\nMATERIALS
      AND METHODS\nWe conducted a systematic scoping review to investigate designs
      and outcome measures used in the studies that evaluated CAs for health interventions.
      We then nested the results into an overarching digital health framework proposed
      by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe review included 81
      studies evaluating CAs in experimental (n\u2009=\u200959), observational (n\u2009=\u200915)
      trials, and other research designs (n\u2009=\u20097). Most studies (n\u2009=\u200972,
      89%) were published in the past 5 years. The proposed CA-evaluation framework
      includes 4 evaluation stages: (1) feasibility/usability, (2) efficacy, (3) effectiveness,
      and (4) implementation, aligning with WHO''s stepwise evaluation strategy. Across
      these stages, this article presents the essential evidence of different study
      designs (n\u2009=\u20098), sample sizes, and main evaluation categories (n\u2009=\u20097)
      with subcategories (n\u2009=\u200940). The main evaluation categories included
      (1) functionality, (2) safety and information quality, (3) user experience,
      (4) clinical and health outcomes, (5) costs and cost benefits, (6) usage, adherence,
      and uptake, and (7) user characteristics for implementation research. Furthermore,
      the framework highlighted the essential evaluation areas (potential primary
      outcomes) and gaps across the evaluation stages.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nThis
      review presents a new framework with practical design details to support the
      evaluation of CA interventions in healthcare research.\n\n\nPROTOCOL REGISTRATION\nThe

      "abstract": "Human intelligence and human consciousness emerge gradually during
      the process of cognitive development. Understanding this development is an essential
      aspect of understanding the human mind and may facilitate the construction of
      artificial minds with similar properties. Importantly, human cognitive development
      relies on embodied interactions with the physical and social environment, which
      is perceived via complementary sensory modalities. These interactions allow
      the developing mind to probe the causal structure of the world. This is in stark
      contrast to common machine learning approaches, e.g., for large language models,
      which are merely passively ``digesting'''' large amounts of training data, but
      are not in control of their sensory inputs. However, computational modeling
      of the kind of self-determined embodied interactions that lead to human intelligence
      and consciousness is a formidable challenge. Here we present MIMo, an open-source
      multi-modal infant model for studying early cognitive development through computer
      simulations. MIMo''s body is modeled after an 18-month-old child with detailed
      five-fingered hands. MIMo perceives its surroundings via binocular vision, a
      vestibular system, proprioception, and touch perception through a full-body
      virtual skin, while two different actuation models allow control of his body.
      We describe the design and interfaces of MIMo and provide examples illustrating
      its use. All code is available at https://github.com/trieschlab/MIMo .", "venue":

      Case\u2013Based Questions", "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs),
      such as ChatGPT (Open AI), are increasingly used in medicine and supplement
      standard search engines as information sources. This leads to more \u201cconsultations\u201d
      of LLMs about personal medical symptoms. Objective This study aims to evaluate
      ChatGPT\u2019s performance in answering clinical case\u2013based questions in
      otorhinolaryngology (ORL) in comparison to ORL consultants\u2019 answers. Methods
      We used 41 case-based questions from established ORL study books and past German
      state examinations for doctors. The questions were answered by both ORL consultants
      and ChatGPT 3. ORL consultants rated all responses, except their own, on medical
      adequacy, conciseness, coherence, and comprehensibility using a 6-point Likert
      scale. They also identified (in a blinded setting) if the answer was created
      by an ORL consultant or ChatGPT. Additionally, the character count was compared.
      Due to the rapidly evolving pace of technology, a comparison between responses
      generated by ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 was included to give an insight into the
      evolving potential of LLMs. Results Ratings in all categories were significantly
      higher for ORL consultants (P<.001). Although inferior to the scores of the
      ORL consultants, ChatGPT\u2019s scores were relatively higher in semantic categories
      (conciseness, coherence, and comprehensibility) compared to medical adequacy.
      ORL consultants identified ChatGPT as the source correctly in 98.4% (121/123)
      of cases. ChatGPT\u2019s answers had a significantly higher character count
      compared to ORL consultants (P<.001). Comparison between responses generated
      by ChatGPT 3 and ChatGPT 4 showed a slight improvement in medical accuracy as
      well as a better coherence of the answers provided. Contrarily, neither the
      conciseness (P=.06) nor the comprehensibility (P=.08) improved significantly
      despite the significant increase in the mean amount of characters by 52.5% (n=
      (1470-964)/964; P<.001). Conclusions While ChatGPT provided longer answers to
      medical problems, medical adequacy and conciseness were significantly lower
      compared to ORL consultants\u2019 answers. LLMs have potential as augmentative
      tools for medical care, but their \u201cconsultation\u201d for medical problems
      carries a high risk of misinformation as their high semantic quality may mask
      contextual deficits.", "venue": "JMIR Medical Education", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      (GP)-based method for the automated design and tuning of process controllers,
      representing a noteworthy advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) within
      the realm of control engineering. In contrast to already existing work, our
      GP-based approach operates exclusively in the time domain, incorporating differential
      operations such as derivatives and integrals without necessitating intermediate
      inverse Laplace transformations. This unique feature not only simplifies the
      design process but also ensures the practical implementability of the generated
      controllers within physical systems. Notably, the GP\u2019s functional set extends
      beyond basic arithmetic operators to include a rich repertoire of mathematical
      operations, encompassing trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.
      This broad set of operations enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
      GP-based approach in controller design. To rigorously assess the efficacy of
      our GP-based approach, we conducted an extensive series of tests to determine
      its limits and capabilities. In summary, our research establishes the GP-based

      established before the digital age, where hardcopies of much smaller volumes
      were archived. In the information age, archives struggle to accommodate the
      large volumes of material produced. In addition, many archives, including in
      South Africa, had to contend with budget cuts that reduced the number of staff
      available. If digital material is not archived now, it creates the risk of gaps
      in the historical record in the future. In addition, with digital humanities
      gaining wider acceptance, large corpuses of digital material are needed, which
      archives could provide. This study\u2019s aim was to investigate whether document
      classification using machine learning classifiers is feasible in a South African
      archive context, with a focus on the National Afrikaans Literary Museum and
      Research Centre (NALN). The researchers created and trained a document classification
      model and tested it for accuracy against human classifiers. It followed a basic
      linguistic approach to prepare specific text documents for text classification,
      in terms of Galloway and Roux\u2019s (2019) six categories, namely articles,
      media reports, books, interviews, reviews, and dissertations and theses. The
      classification was done using two annotators, after which the annotated corpus
      was employed as training data for machine learning models. Following Rolan et
      al. (2018), Suominen (2019), and Connelly et al. (2020), Python libraries were
      used for document classifications. The researchers show that machine learning
      classifiers can accurately categorise documents into different types. If implemented,
      this means that archives can improve their collection efforts without spending
      more on salaries. One way of coping with the information explosion is to develop
      metadata generation tools, like machine learning and artificial intelligence.
      If metadata could be automatically generated, it would reduce the pressure on
      archival personnel by providing a way to handle larger volumes.", "venue": "Journal

      article provides a survey of rationality and irrationality in artificial intelligence,

      in other fields has influenced its conception within artificial intelligence,
      in particular work in economics, philosophy and psychology. Focusing on the
      behaviour of artificial agents, we consider irrational behaviours that can prove
      to be optimal in certain scenarios. Some methods have been developed to deal
      with irrational agents, both in terms of identification and interaction, however
      work in this area remains limited. Methods that have up to now been developed
      for other purposes, namely adversarial scenarios, may be adapted to suit interactions
      with artificial agents. We further discuss the interplay between human and artificial
      agents, and the role that rationality plays within this interaction; many questions
      remain in this area, relating to potentially irrational behaviour of both humans

      are active open systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The ability to behave
      actively corresponds to dynamical metastability: minor but supercritical internal
      or external effects may trigger major substantial actions such as gross mechanical
      motion, dissipating internally accumulated energy reserves. Gaining a selective
      advantage from the beneficial use of activity requires a consistent combination
      of sensual perception, memorised experience, statistical or causal prediction
      models, and the resulting favourable decisions on actions. This information
      processing chain originated from mere physical interaction processes prior to
      life, here denoted as structural information exchange. From there, the self-organised
      transition to symbolic information processing marks the beginning of life, evolving
      through the novel purposivity of trial-and-error feedback and the accumulation
      of symbolic information. The emergence of symbols and prediction models can
      be described as a ritualisation transition, a symmetry-breaking kinetic phase
      transition of the second kind previously known from behavioural biology. The
      related new symmetry is the neutrally stable arbitrariness, conventionality,
      or code invariance of symbols with respect to their meaning. The meaning of
      such symbols is given by the structural effect they ultimately unleash, directly
      or indirectly, by deciding on which actions to take. The early genetic code
      represents the first symbols. The genetically inherited symbolic information
      is the first prediction model for activities sufficient for survival under the
      condition of environmental continuity, sometimes understood as the \u201cfinal
      causality\u201d property of the model.", "venue": "Entropy", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      network models often overlook a central biological fact about neural processing:
      that single neurons are themselves complex, semi-autonomous computing systems.
      Both the information processing and information storage abilities of actual
      biological neurons vastly exceed the simple weighted sum of synaptic inputs
      computed by the \u201cunits\u201d in standard neural network models. Neurons
      are eukaryotic cells that store information not only in synapses, but also in
      their dendritic structure and connectivity, as well as genetic \u201cmarking\u201d
      in the epigenome of each individual cell. Each neuron computes a complex nonlinear
      function of its inputs, roughly equivalent in processing capacity to an entire
      1990s-era neural network model. Furthermore, individual cells provide the biological
      interface between gene expression, ongoing neural processing, and stored long-term
      memory traces. Neurons in all organisms have these properties, which are thus
      relevant to all of neuroscience and cognitive biology. Single-cell computation
      may also play a particular role in explaining some unusual features of human
      cognition. The recognition of the centrality of cellular computation to \u201cnatural
      computation\u201d in brains, and of the constraints it imposes upon brain evolution,
      thus has important implications for the evolution of cognition, and how we study

      "abstract": "Abstract. Machine learning (ML) is increasing in popularity in
      the field of weather and climate modelling. Applications range from improved
      solvers and preconditioners, to parameterization scheme emulation and replacement,
      and more recently even to full ML-based weather and climate prediction models.
      While ML has been used in this space for more than 25\u00a0years, it is only
      in the last 10 or so years that progress has accelerated to the point that ML
      applications are becoming competitive with numerical knowledge-based alternatives.
      In this review, we provide a roughly chronological summary of the application
      of ML to aspects of weather and climate modelling from early publications through
      to the latest progress at the time of writing. We also provide an overview of
      key ML terms, methodologies, and ethical considerations. Finally, we discuss
      some potentially beneficial future research directions. Our aim is to provide
      a primer for researchers and model developers to rapidly familiarize and update
      themselves with the world of ML in the context of weather and climate models.\n",

      "title": "Towards Evaluating AI Systems for Moral Status Using Self-Reports",
      "abstract": "As AI systems become more advanced and widely deployed, there will
      likely be increasing debate over whether AI systems could have conscious experiences,
      desires, or other states of potential moral significance. It is important to
      inform these discussions with empirical evidence to the extent possible. We
      argue that under the right circumstances, self-reports, or an AI system''s statements
      about its own internal states, could provide an avenue for investigating whether
      AI systems have states of moral significance. Self-reports are the main way
      such states are assessed in humans (\"Are you in pain?\"), but self-reports
      from current systems like large language models are spurious for many reasons
      (e.g. often just reflecting what humans would say). To make self-reports more
      appropriate for this purpose, we propose to train models to answer many kinds
      of questions about themselves with known answers, while avoiding or limiting
      training incentives that bias self-reports. The hope of this approach is that
      models will develop introspection-like capabilities, and that these capabilities
      will generalize to questions about states of moral significance. We then propose
      methods for assessing the extent to which these techniques have succeeded: evaluating
      self-report consistency across contexts and between similar models, measuring
      the confidence and resilience of models'' self-reports, and using interpretability
      to corroborate self-reports. We also discuss challenges for our approach, from
      philosophical difficulties in interpreting self-reports to technical reasons
      why our proposal might fail. We hope our discussion inspires philosophers and
      AI researchers to criticize and improve our proposed methodology, as well as
      to run experiments to test whether self-reports can be made reliable enough
      to provide information about states of moral significance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      Perspective", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence experienced a technological
      breakthrough in science, industry, and everyday life in the recent few decades.
      The advancements can be credited to the ever-increasing availability and miniaturization
      of computational resources that resulted in exponential data growth. However,
      because of the insufficient amount of data in some cases, employing machine
      learning in solving complex tasks is not straightforward or even possible. As
      a result, machine learning with small data experiences rising importance in
      data science and application in several fields. The authors focus on interpreting
      the general term of\"small data\"and their engineering and industrial application
      role. They give a brief overview of the most important industrial applications
      of machine learning and small data. Small data is defined in terms of various
      characteristics compared to big data, and a machine learning formalism was introduced.
      Five critical challenges of machine learning with small data in industrial applications
      are presented: unlabeled data, imbalanced data, missing data, insufficient data,
      and rare events. Based on those definitions, an overview of the considerations
      in domain representation and data acquisition is given along with a taxonomy

      Neural Networks", "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been an attractive
      option for deployment on devices with limited computing resources and lower
      power consumption because of the event-driven computing characteristic. As such
      devices have limited computing and storage resources, pruning for SNNs has been
      widely focused recently. However, the binary and non-differentiable property
      of spike signals make pruning deep SNNs challenging, so existing methods require
      high time overhead to make pruning decisions. In this paper, inspired by critical
      brain hypothesis in neuroscience, we design a regeneration mechanism based on
      criticality to efficiently obtain the critical pruned networks. Firstly, we
      propose a low-cost metric for the criticality of pruning structures. Then we
      re-rank the pruned structures after pruning and regenerate those with higher
      criticality. We evaluate our method using VGG-16 and ResNet-19 for both unstructured
      pruning and structured pruning. Our method achieves higher performance compared
      to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with the same time overhead. We also
      achieve comparable performances (even better on VGG-16) compared to the SOTA
      method with 11.3x and 15.5x acceleration. Moreover, we investigate underlying

      "We propose a framework for classifying the capabilities and behavior of Artificial
      General Intelligence (AGI) models and their precursors. This framework introduces
      levels of AGI performance, generality, and autonomy. It is our hope that this
      framework will be useful in an analogous way to the levels of autonomous driving,
      by providing a common language to compare models, assess risks, and measure
      progress along the path to AGI. To develop our framework, we analyze existing
      definitions of AGI, and distill six principles that a useful ontology for AGI
      should satisfy. These principles include focusing on capabilities rather than
      mechanisms; separately evaluating generality and performance; and defining stages
      along the path toward AGI, rather than focusing on the endpoint. With these
      principles in mind, we propose ''Levels of AGI'' based on depth (performance)
      and breadth (generality) of capabilities, and reflect on how current systems
      fit into this ontology. We discuss the challenging requirements for future benchmarks
      that quantify the behavior and capabilities of AGI models against these levels.
      Finally, we discuss how these levels of AGI interact with deployment considerations
      such as autonomy and risk, and emphasize the importance of carefully selecting
      Human-AI Interaction paradigms for responsible and safe deployment of highly
      capable AI systems.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "In the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), introduction
      of well-defined and standardized evaluation methodologies remains a crucial
      challenge. This paper traces the historical trajectory of LLM evaluations, from
      the foundational questions posed by Alan Turing to the modern era of AI research.
      We categorize the evolution of LLMs into distinct periods, each characterized
      by its unique benchmarks and evaluation criteria. As LLMs increasingly mimic
      human-like behaviors, traditional evaluation proxies, such as the Turing test,
      have become less reliable. We emphasize the pressing need for a unified evaluation
      system, given the broader societal implications of these models. Through an
      analysis of common evaluation methodologies, we advocate for a qualitative shift
      in assessment approaches, underscoring the importance of standardization and
      objective criteria. This work serves as a call for the AI community to collaboratively
      address the challenges of LLM evaluation, ensuring their reliability, fairness,
      and societal benefit.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      is increasing significantly year on year. Clear domains or disciplines of research
      related to AI within the social sciences can be grouped into sub-areas such
      as law and legal reasoning, education, economics, and ethics. The United States
      is the country that publishes the most (20%), followed by China (13%). The influence
      of AI on society is inevitable and the advances can generate great opportunities

      "title": "A Definition of Open-Ended Learning Problems for Goal-Conditioned
      Agents", "abstract": "A lot of recent machine learning research papers have\"Open-ended
      learning\"in their title. But very few of them attempt to define what they mean
      when using the term. Even worse, when looking more closely there seems to be
      no consensus on what distinguishes open-ended learning from related concepts
      such as continual learning, lifelong learning or autotelic learning. In this
      paper, we contribute to fixing this situation. After illustrating the genealogy
      of the concept and more recent perspectives about what it truly means, we outline
      that open-ended learning is generally conceived as a composite notion encompassing
      a set of diverse properties. In contrast with these previous approaches, we
      propose to isolate a key elementary property of open-ended processes, which
      is to always produce novel elements from time to time over an infinite horizon.
      From there, we build the notion of open-ended learning problems and focus in
      particular on the subset of open-ended goal-conditioned reinforcement learning
      problems, as this framework facilitates the definition of learning a growing
      repertoire of skills. Finally, we highlight the work that remains to be performed
      to fill the gap between our elementary definition and the more involved notions
      of open-ended learning that developmental AI researchers may have in mind.",

      "To what degree should we ascribe cognitive capacities to Large Language Models
      (LLMs), such as the ability to reason about intentions and beliefs known as
      Theory of Mind (ToM)? Here we add to this emerging debate by (i) testing 11
      base- and instruction-tuned LLMs on capabilities relevant to ToM beyond the
      dominant false-belief paradigm, including non-literal language usage and recursive
      intentionality; (ii) using newly rewritten versions of standardized tests to
      gauge LLMs\u2019 robustness; (iii) prompting and scoring for open besides closed
      questions; and (iv) benchmarking LLM performance against that of children aged
      7-10 on the same tasks. We find that instruction-tuned LLMs from the GPT family
      outperform other models, and often also children. Base-LLMs are mostly unable
      to solve ToM tasks, even with specialized prompting. We suggest that the interlinked
      evolution and development of language and ToM may help explain what instruction-tuning
      adds: rewarding cooperative communication that takes into account interlocutor
      and context. We conclude by arguing for a nuanced perspective on ToM in LLMs.",

      behave like average-level humans with inexpensive infrastructures. Unfortunately,
      to date there has not been a satisfactory solution that registers large-scale
      use. In this work, we attempt to develop practical PARs (dubbed ParliRobo) showing
      acceptably humanoid behaviors with well affordable infrastructures under a challenging
      scenario-a 3D-FPS (first-person shooter) mobile MMOG with real-time interaction
      requirements. Based on comprehensive real-world explorations, we eventually
      enable our attempt through a novel ?transform and polish\" methodology. It achieves
      ultralight implementations of the core system components by non-intuitive yet
      principled approaches, and meanwhile carefully fixes the probable side effect
      incurred on user perceptions. Evaluation results from large-scale deployment
      indicate the close resemblance (96% on average) in biofidelity metrics between

      monopoly over the domain of hermeneutics, computational creativity destabilizes
      the foundations of its lexical reference, invoking Walter Benjamin\u2019s musings
      on the age of technological reproducibility. How may we delineate the parameters
      of creativity outside the bounds of apperceptive intent, especially if the generative
      process is strictly reliant upon conditional expressions of correlational nature
      rather than the transcendental aura of instantaneous inspiration? Should procedurally
      derived computational outputs deserve the label of creativity? If so, then how
      do such developments affect and even reconfigure human language to challenge
      the metrics whereby we inscribe it with social value? By probing the interstitial
      space between algorithmic design and arbitrary semantics through readings of
      autonomously written fiction, this essay investigates how computational creativity
      remediates literary expressivity in text-generating models. Based on the concept
      of intentional patiency, which I propose as an alternative to the agency of
      the phenomenological sovereign subject in the valuation and appreciation of
      nonhuman creativity, the essay asks what it means to write, and what writing
      means in an age when not only artistic output, but also creative agency may
      be approaching the singularity event horizon.", "venue": "Science Fiction Studies",

      of artificial intelligence (AI) on innovation dynamics and argue that AI has
      affected innovation dynamics in at least two distinct ways. First, innovation
      using AI has unique dynamics that are characterised by data playing a central
      role and the increasing importance of external collaboration; however, data
      security and privacy issues also present new risks to external collaboration.
      When innovating in AI, collaboration with customers and competitors is critical,
      yet there are considerable risks associated with data sharing. Second, unique
      organisational challenges emerge during the diffusion of AI innovations, because
      adopting AI in an organisation not only results in the need for additional employee
      competencies but also challenges organisational power structures. We also discuss
      the merits of AI as a general purpose technology and argue that conclusions
      about AI in relation to innovation dynamics are likely to change when generative
      AI is widely adopted.", "venue": "Industry and Innovation", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      is not simply a norm but actually the explication of corporate agents\u2019
      ideas about rational choice institutionalism which leads to adverse impacts
      on vulnerable groups and ecologies known as adverse inclusion. The second investigates
      the role of ideas as adequacy and self-explication in guiding Palestinian actors\u2019
      actions towards the deepening of neoliberalization in Palestine. The third explains
      the relevance of the systemic persistence problematique for understanding how

      concerning AI agents that can perceive, respond to, and simulate emotions across
      32 distinct scenarios. Our results indicate a preference for scenarios that
      involve human interaction, emotional support, and creative tasks, with influences
      from factors such as emotional reappraisal and personality traits. Overall,

      of Twitter bots in science dissemination", "abstract": "Twitter bots are a controversial
      element of the platform, and their negative impact is well known. In the field
      of scientific communication, they have been perceived in a more positive light,
      and the accounts that serve as feeds alerting about scientific publications
      are quite common. However, despite being aware of the presence of bots in the
      dissemination of science, no large-scale estimations have been made nor has
      it been evaluated if they can truly interfere with altmetrics. Analyzing a dataset
      of 3,744,231 papers published between 2017 and 2021 and their associated 51,230,936
      Twitter mentions, our goal was to determine the volume of publications mentioned
      by bots and whether they skew altmetrics indicators. Using the BotometerLite
      API, we categorized Twitter accounts based on their likelihood of being bots.
      The results showed that 11,073 accounts (0.23% of total users) exhibited automated
      behavior, contributing to 4.72% of all mentions. A significant bias was observed
      in the activity of bots. Their presence was particularly pronounced in disciplines
      such as Mathematics, Physics, and Space Sciences, with some specialties even
      exceeding 70% of the tweets. However, these are extreme cases, and the impact
      of this activity on altmetrics varies by speciality, with minimal influence
      in Arts&Humanities and Social Sciences. This research emphasizes the importance
      of distinguishing between specialties and disciplines when using Twitter as
      an altmetric.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 46, "citationCount":

      the developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their current
      and prospective applications in endof-life communications. It uses Open AI\u2019s
      generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3) as a case study to understand the
      possibilities of AI-aided communication in Palliative Care. Material and Methods:
      Open AI\u2019s GPT-3 was taken as a case study where responses were generated
      through the GPT-3 beta playground (Davinci engine) and were scrutinised by six
      mental health professionals (MHPs) working in a palliative care setting in India.
      They were tasked to evaluate the responses generated by the AI (the identity
      was not revealed until a part of the study was completed) in a simulated palliative
      care conversation with another MHP posing as a patient. The aim was to undermine
      whether the professionals were able to detect that the responses were indeed
      generated by a machine and did they approve or disapprove of the responses.
      Results: The GPT-3 playground with the right prompts produced remarkable, often
      surprising texts and responses that imitated human interaction. However, glitches
      such as redundancy were noticed along with strongly held opinions in certain
      questions related to faith, death, and life after death. Conclusion: AI-assisted
      communication in palliative care could be used to train professionals in the
      palliative care field using it as a simulation in training. It could also be
      used as a therapeutic intervention for the purpose of engagement and philosophical
      dialogue after certain modifications. However, it would have its own limitations
      such as it cannot replace a human agent just yet.", "venue": "Indian Journal

      Takeover of Animated Characters", "abstract": "Online social virtual worlds
      are now becoming widely available on consumer devices including virtual reality
      headsets. One goal of a virtual world could be to give a user an experience
      of a crowded environment with many virtual humans. However, gathering enough
      personnel to control the necessary number of avatars for creating a realistic
      scene is usually difficult. Additionally, current technology is not capable
      of fully simulating avatars with behaviours, especially when interaction with
      users is required. In this paper, we develop a system that enables an actor
      to take over control of one of a set of avatars. We built an immersive interface
      that allows an actor to select an avatar to take over and then segue into the
      currently playing animation. By allowing one person to take control of multiple
      avatars, we can enhance the plausibility of environments inhabited by simulated
      characters. In an experiment, we show that in a cafe scenario, one actor can
      take over the roles of a barista and two customers. Experiment participants
      reported experiencing the scene as if it were populated by more than one actor.
      This system and experiment demonstrate the feasibility of one actor controlling
      multiple avatars sequentially, thus enhancing users\u2019 feelings of being
      in a populated environment.", "venue": "International Symposium on Mixed and

      "The increasing need for text content creation today challenges the development
      of systems that can alleviate the need for text creation. Currently, text generation
      is done manually and has various shortcomings, especially in terms of time constraints,
      human error, limited creativity, and writing that tends to be repetitive by
      certain people, which can cause a decrease in quality and diversity in the sentences
      produced. This research was conducted by designing an AI-based text generator
      application using the GPT-3 language model to generate text automatically and
      help overcome some obstacles. Applying this app will increase efficiency and
      productivity, increase the writer''s ideas and creativity, automate routine
      tasks, and produce exciting and communicative sentences. The app''s ability
      to generate text quickly and accurately and be personalized makes it valuable
      in various fields. The method used in this research is implementing the GPT-3
      language model APIs into the text generator application created so that the
      application can connect with the GPT-3 engine that has been modified in its
      prompting method. The output of this application is a text that has been adjusted
      to the user''s needs through keywords entered on the web interface system. The
      result is that the text generator application is good enough to be implemented

      "Knowledge Question Answering is one of the important research directions in
      the field of robot intelligence. It is mainly based on background knowledge
      to analyze users\u2019 questions and generate answers. It is one of the important
      application methods of knowledge graph technology. Compared with the traditional
      expert system of question and answer, it has the advantage of a large-scale

      question-answering under the support of a knowledge database, proposes a knowledge

      applications since they can represent data coupled with its meaning and context.
      Aligning KGs across different domains and providers is necessary to afford a
      fuller and integrated representation. A severe limitation of current KG alignment
      (KGA) algorithms is that they fail to articulate logical thinking and reasoning
      with lexical, structural, and semantic data learning. Deep learning models are
      increasingly popular for KGA inspired by their good performance in other tasks,
      but they suffer from limitations in explainability, reasoning, and data efficiency.
      Hybrid neurosymbolic learning models hold the promise of integrating logical
      and data perspectives to produce high-quality alignments that are explainable
      and support validation through human-centric approaches. This paper examines

      Models empower them to follow freeform instructions, including imitating generic
      or specific demographic personas in conversations. We define generic personas
      to represent demographic groups, such as\"an Asian person\", whereas specific
      personas may take the form of specific popular Asian names like\"Yumi\". While
      the adoption of personas enriches user experiences by making dialogue systems
      more engaging and approachable, it also casts a shadow of potential risk by
      exacerbating social biases within model responses, thereby causing societal
      harm through interactions with users. In this paper, we systematically study\"persona
      biases\", which we define to be the sensitivity of dialogue models'' harmful
      behaviors contingent upon the personas they adopt. We categorize persona biases
      into biases in harmful expression and harmful agreement, and establish a comprehensive
      evaluation framework to measure persona biases in five aspects: Offensiveness,
      Toxic Continuation, Regard, Stereotype Agreement, and Toxic Agreement. Additionally,
      we propose to investigate persona biases by experimenting with UNIVERSALPERSONA,
      a systematically constructed persona dataset encompassing various types of both
      generic and specific model personas. Through benchmarking on four different
      models -- including Blender, ChatGPT, Alpaca, and Vicuna -- our study uncovers
      significant persona biases in dialogue systems. Our findings also underscore
      the pressing need to revisit the use of personas in dialogue agents to ensure
      safe application.", "venue": "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language

      explanation of the Q-Learning Black Scholes approach, introduced by Halperin
      (2017). This reinforcement learning approach bridges the traditional Black and
      Scholes (1973) model with novel artificial intelligence algorithms, enabling
      option pricing and hedging in a completely model-free and data-driven way. This
      paper also explores the algorithm''s performance under different state variables
      and scenarios for a European put option. The results reveal that the model is
      an accurate estimator under different levels of volatility and hedging frequency.
      Moreover, this method exhibits robust performance across various levels of option''s
      moneyness. Lastly, the algorithm incorporates proportional transaction costs,
      indicating diverse impacts on profit and loss, affected by different statistical

      that beyond humanness, the perceived socialness of an agent appeared to be as
      important, if not more so, for mind attribution. Our findings suggest that top-down
      knowledge cues are just as important, if not more so, than bottom-up stimulus
      cues when exploring mind attribution in non-human agents. While further work
      is now required to test this hypothesis directly, these preliminary findings

      The first element pertains to the actual behavior of opponent NPCs, while the
      second focuses on the dialogues employed to highlight NPC decision-making. We
      conducted a user study to assess whether players can discern between complex
      and simple NPC behavior during gameplay in a specific scenario of a top-down

      their effect on player perception. In the end, our findings revealed that when
      simple dialogs were used, players derived greater enjoyment from a more complex

      a complex behavior in player enjoyment.", "venue": "Proceedings of the AAAI

      extent the \u201cother\u201d in communicative interactions may be otherwise
      than another human subject and the moral opportunities and challenges this alteration
      would make available to us. Toward this end, the analysis proceeds in five steps
      or movements. The first reviews the way the discipline of communication has
      typically perceived and theorized the role and function of technology. The second
      and third parts investigate the critical challenges that emerging technology,
      such as artificial intelligence applications and robots, poses to this standard
      instrumentalist way of thinking. The fourth part introduces an alternative called
      \u201crelational ethics,\u201d which effectively flips the script on the usual
      way of proceeding. And the fifth part presents and responds to one important
      and notable objection to this alternative. The goal in all of this is not to
      complicate things but to introduce and formulate a techno-ethics that is more
      agile in its response to the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century
      and beyond.", "venue": "Journal of Media Ethics", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      data universalism, and unintentional criti-hype. As the authors touch upon each

      have shown promise in prognostic assessment, but challenges remain in achieving
      a higher prediction accuracy for practical clinical use. We suggest that accumulating
      more diverse data, including medical imaging and collaborative efforts among

      in polynomial time using deterministic algorithms, contrasting it with the class
      NP, where finding efficient solutions remains an enigmatic endeavor, understanding
      the intricacies of algorithmic transitions and thresholds demarcating the boundary
      between tractable and intractable problems. We will discuss the implications
      of the P versus NP problem, representing one of the profoundest unsolved enigmas
      of computer science and mathematics, bearing a tantalizing reward for its resolution.
      Drawing parallels between combinatorics and statistical physics, we will uncover
      intriguing interconnections that shed light on the nature of challenging problems.
      Statistical physics unveils profound analogies with complexities witnessed in
      combinatorial landscapes. Throughout this chapter, we will discuss the interplay
      between computational complexity theory and statistical physics. By unveiling
      the mysteries surrounding challenging problems, we aim to deepen understanding

      "title": "AI in Software Engineering: Case Studies and Prospects", "abstract":
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) and software engineering (SE) are two important
      areas in computer science. In recent years, researchers are trying to apply
      AI techniques in various stages of software development to improve the overall
      quality of software products. Moreover, there are also some researchers focus
      on the intersection between SE and AI. In fact, the relationship between SE
      and AI is very weak; however, methods and techniques in one area have been adopted
      in another area. More and more software products are capable of performing intelligent
      behaviour like human beings. In this paper, two cases studies which are IBM
      Watson and Google AlphaGo that use different AI techniques in solving real world
      challenging problems have been analysed, evaluated and compared. Based on the
      analysis of both case studies, using AI techniques such as deep learning and
      machine learning in software systems contributes to intelligent systems. Watson
      adopts ''decision making support'' strategy to help human make decisions; whereas
      AlphaGo uses ''self-decision making'' to choose operations that contribute to
      the best outcome. In addition, Watson learns from man-made resources such as
      paper; AlphaGo, on the other hand, learns from massive online resources such
      as photos. AlphaGo uses neural networks and reinforcement learning to mimic
      human brain, which might be very useful in medical research for diagnosis and
      treatment. However, there is still a long way to go if we want to reproduce
      human brain in machine and view computers as thinkers, because human brain and
      machines are intrinsically different. It would be more promising to see whether
      computers and software systems will become more and more intelligent to help
      with real world challenging problems that human beings cannot do.", "venue":

      "\n In the context of water distribution networks (WDNs), researchers and technicians
      are actively working on new ways to transition into the digital era. They are
      focusing on creating standardized methods that fit the unique characteristics
      of these systems, with a strong emphasis on developing customized digital twins.
      This involves combining advanced hydraulic modeling with advanced data-driven
      techniques like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.
      This paper begins by giving a detailed overview of the important progress that
      has led to this digital transformation. It highlights the potential to create
      interconnected digital water services (DWSs) that can support all aspects of
      managing, planning, and designing WDNs. This approach introduces standardized
      procedures that allow a continuous improvement of the digital representation
      of these networks. Additionally, technicians benefit from DWSs developed as
      QGIS software plugins. These services strategically enhance their understanding
      of technical decisions, improving logical reasoning, consistency, scalability,
      integrability, efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability for both short-term
      and long-term management tasks. Notably, the framework remains adaptable, ready
      to embrace upcoming technological advancements and data gathering capabilities,
      all while keeping end-users central in shaping these technical developments.",

      "abstract": "Conversational agents are in place in a variety of domains and
      tasks such as sales and customer support services in business, student counselling
      in education and medical services in healthcare. There is abundant data available
      for modelling dialogs because online chat has been a popular way of communication
      between humans already for several decades. There are also innumerable other
      valuable digital resources that can be exploited when building a conversational
      agent, including pretrained large language models. We tested and evaluated several
      ways of preprocessing and modelling of chat dialogs in Finnish. As a result,
      we found out that the best accuracy is achieved using uncasing and spell-checking
      in the preprocessing phase and a BERT model pretrained with Finnish in the modelling
      phase. Despite the extensive use of conversational agents, there are still many
      open research questions. One example is the effect of the interaction style
      of the agent on user experience and emotions. Our initial study suggests that
      chatbots including small talk are less likely to elicit negative emotions, whereby
      emojis and emotional statements issued by chatbots do not play a significant
      role on the user\u2019s emotional responses. We also discuss how medical expert
      work may be partially automated and made more interesting as input for routine

      the understanding and generation of human-like text. Studies have found LLMs
      abilities to perform well in various examinations including law, business and
      medicine. This study aims to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in the United
      Kingdom Medical Licensing Assessment (UKMLA). Methods Two publicly available
      UKMLA papers consisting of 200 single-best-answer (SBA) questions were screened.
      Nine SBAs were omitted as they contained images that were not suitable for input.
      Each question was assigned a specialty based on the UKMLA content map published
      by the General Medical Council. A total of 191 SBAs were inputted in ChatGPT-4
      through three attempts over the course of 3\u2009weeks (once per week). Results
      ChatGPT scored 74.9% (143/191), 78.0% (149/191) and 75.6% (145/191) on three
      attempts, respectively. The average of all three attempts was 76.3% (437/573)
      with a 95% confidence interval of (74.46% and 78.08%). ChatGPT answered 129
      SBAs correctly and 32 SBAs incorrectly on all three attempts. On three attempts,
      ChatGPT performed well in mental health (8/9 SBAs), cancer (11/14 SBAs) and
      cardiovascular (10/13 SBAs). On three attempts, ChatGPT did not perform well
      in clinical haematology (3/7 SBAs), endocrine and metabolic (2/5 SBAs) and gastrointestinal
      including liver (3/10 SBAs). Regarding to response consistency, ChatGPT provided
      correct answers consistently in 67.5% (129/191) of SBAs but provided incorrect
      answers consistently in 12.6% (24/191) and inconsistent response in 19.9% (38/191)
      of SBAs, respectively. Discussion and conclusion This study suggests ChatGPT
      performs well in the UKMLA. There may be a potential correlation between specialty
      performance. LLMs ability to correctly answer SBAs suggests that it could be
      utilised as a supplementary learning tool in medical education with appropriate

      "Human consciousness has been a long-lasting mystery for centuries, while machine
      intelligence and consciousness is an arduous pursuit. Researchers have developed
      diverse theories for interpreting the consciousness phenomenon in human brains
      from different perspectives and levels. This paper surveys several main branches
      of consciousness theories originating from different subjects including information
      theory, quantum physics, cognitive psychology, physiology and computer science,
      with the aim of bridging these theories from a computational perspective. It
      also discusses the existing evaluation metrics of consciousness and possibility
      for current computational models to be conscious. Breaking the mystery of consciousness
      can be an essential step in building general artificial intelligence with computing
      machines.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 149, "citationCount":

      decisions. The study period was from January 2012 to November 2022 for twenty-four
      currencies against the US dollar. Based on four technical indicators: the simple
      moving average (SMA), momentum, moving average convergence divergence (MACD),
      and relative strength index (RSI), with a total of 131\u2009months. Of them,
      51\u2009months are for ANN construction (supervised learning), while 80\u2009months
      are for hypothesis testing. The study used cross-sectional analysis and hierarchical
      multiple regression in addition to the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Kruskal\u2013Wallis
      test. The study found a significant improvement in the values predicted for
      exchange rates for emerging economies by artificial neural networks versus the
      values predicted by technical indicators alone. Finally, the study found a significant
      difference of gap between the values predicted for exchange rates for emerging
      economies by artificial neural networks and the actual values based on currency.
      It is possible to study the interpretation of this result according to the difference
      in each of the exchange rate regimes in emerging economies, in addition to the
      difference in structural imbalances between those economies.", "venue": "Cogent

      I examine the feature of AIs that enables them to improve their intelligence,
      i.e., machine learning. I argue that there is no reason to believe that future
      advances in machine learning will take AIs closer to having a good of their
      own. I thus argue that concerns about the moral status of future AIs are unwarranted.

      "title": "Beyond Traditional Teaching: The Potential of Large Language Models
      and Chatbots in Graduate Engineering Education", "abstract": "In the rapidly
      evolving landscape of education, digital technologies have repeatedly disrupted
      traditional pedagogical methods. This paper explores the latest of these disruptions:
      the potential integration of large language models (LLMs) and chatbots into
      graduate engineering education. We begin by tracing historical and technological
      disruptions to provide context and then introduce key terms such as machine
      learning and deep learning and the underlying mechanisms of recent advancements,
      namely attention/transformer models and graphics processing units. The heart
      of our investigation lies in the application of an LLM-based chatbot in a graduate
      fluid mechanics course. We developed a question bank from the course material
      and assessed the chatbot''s ability to provide accurate, insightful responses.
      The results are encouraging, demonstrating not only the bot''s ability to effectively
      answer complex questions but also the potential advantages of chatbot usage
      in the classroom, such as the promotion of self-paced learning, the provision
      of instantaneous feedback, and the reduction of instructors'' workload. The
      study also examines the transformative effect of intelligent prompting on enhancing
      the chatbot''s performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how powerful plugins
      like Wolfram Alpha for mathematical problem-solving and code interpretation
      can significantly extend the chatbot''s capabilities, transforming it into a
      comprehensive educational tool. While acknowledging the challenges and ethical
      implications surrounding the use of such AI models in education, we advocate
      for a balanced approach. The use of LLMs and chatbots in graduate education
      can be greatly beneficial but requires ongoing evaluation and adaptation to
      ensure ethical and efficient use.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      biology, physics, medicine, social sciences, chemistry, and engineering. We

      These three disciplines also present the highest IFs. Mathematics journals display
      a low IF (the second-lowest among disciplines), but possesses an intermediate
      centrality. While the average IF has increased over the last years, the SJR

      intelligence to support people from Generation Z in the process of assimilating
      knowledge. The AI-based tools aimed at improving language competence analyzed
      in the study included Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVA): Google Assistant,
      Siri as well as web translators.\u00a0The following research procedure was adopted:
      the experiment included an attempt to learn a foreign language using one of
      the IVAs or web translators. 251 Polish students decided to participate in the
      research. After the learning session, respondents completed a knowledge test
      concerning popular phrases in a given language. The results were related to
      the individual characteristics of the respondents and analyzed statistically.\u00a0Interesting
      overall results were obtained. The data was also analyzed in subgroups, distinguished
      on the basis of gender, the tool used (web translator, IVAs: Google Assistant,
      and Siri) as well as the language chosen for learning a foreign language. The
      analyses were aimed at identifying differences conditioned by the gender of
      the learner. Another challenge was to identify the most effective tool and to
      determine which languages are the easiest and most difficult to learn using
      this method. In many cases, the acquisition of new vocabulary turned out to
      be very promising. This suggests that people\u2019s adoption of such an innovative
      form of learning is a rather individual matter, varying from person to person.\u00a0The
      study is designed to show a new perspective on acquiring knowledge, improving
      competence and learning in an informal way. In this case, learners use artificial
      assistants based on artificial intelligence and learning algorithms. This is

      a Biological Neural Network", "abstract": "It has been shown that three-dimensional
      self-assembled multicellular structures derived from human pluripotent stem
      cells show electrical activity similar to EEG. More recently, neurons were successfully
      embedded in digital game worlds. The biologically inspired neural network (BNN),
      expressing human cortical cells, was able to show internal modification and
      learn the task at hand (predicting the trajectory of a digital ball while moving
      a digital paddle). In other words, the system allowed to read motor information
      and write sensory data into cell cultures. In this article, we discuss Neural
      Correlates of Consciousness (NCC) theories, and their capacity to predict or
      even allow for consciousness in a BNN. We found that Information Integration
      Theory (IIT) is the only NCC that offers the possibility for a BNN to show consciousness,
      since the \u03a6 value in the BNN is >0. In other words, the recording of real-time
      neural activity responding to environmental stimuli. IIT argues that any system
      capable of integrating information will have some degree of phenomenal consciousness.
      We argue that the pattern of activity appearing in the BNN, with increased density
      of sensory information leading to better performance, implies that the BNN could
      be conscious. This may have profound implications from a psychological, philosophical,
      and ethical perspective.", "venue": "Entropy", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      Testing, and Manufacturing: The FDA Perspectives", "abstract": "Abstract Artificial
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent significant advancements
      in computing, building on technologies that humanity has developed over millions
      of years\u2014from the abacus to quantum computers. These tools have reached
      a pivotal moment in their development. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) received over 100 product registration submissions that
      heavily relied on AI/ML for applications such as monitoring and improving human
      performance in compiling dossiers. To ensure the safe and effective use of AI/ML
      in drug discovery and manufacturing, the FDA and numerous other U.S. federal
      agencies have issued continuously updated, stringent guidelines. Intriguingly,
      these guidelines are often generated or updated with the aid of AI/ML tools
      themselves. The overarching goal is to expedite drug discovery, enhance the
      safety profiles of existing drugs, introduce novel treatment modalities, and
      improve manufacturing compliance and robustness. Recent FDA publications offer
      an encouraging outlook on the potential of these tools, emphasizing the need
      for their careful deployment. This has expanded market opportunities for retraining
      personnel handling these technologies and enabled innovative applications in
      emerging therapies such as gene editing, CRISPR-Cas9, CAR-T cells, mRNA-based
      treatments, and personalized medicine. In summary, the maturation of AI/ML technologies
      is a testament to human ingenuity. Far from being autonomous entities, these
      are tools created by and for humans designed to solve complex problems now and
      in the future. This paper aims to present the status of these technologies,
      along with examples of their present and future applications.", "venue": "Drug

      "title": "Enhancing the Evidence with Algorithms: How Artificial Intelligence
      Is Transforming Forensic Medicine", "abstract": "Background: The integration
      of artificial intelligence (AI) into various fields has ushered in a new era
      of multidisciplinary progress. Defined as the ability of a system to interpret
      external data, learn from it, and adapt to specific tasks, AI is poised to revolutionize
      the world. In forensic medicine and pathology, algorithms play a crucial role
      in data analysis, pattern recognition, anomaly identification, and decision
      making. This review explores the diverse applications of AI in forensic medicine,
      encompassing fields such as forensic identification, ballistics, traumatic injuries,
      postmortem interval estimation, forensic toxicology, and more. Results: A thorough
      review of 113 articles revealed a subset of 32 papers directly relevant to the
      research, covering a wide range of applications. These included forensic identification,
      ballistics and additional factors of shooting, traumatic injuries, post-mortem
      interval estimation, forensic toxicology, sexual assaults/rape, crime scene
      reconstruction, virtual autopsy, and medical act quality evaluation. The studies

      writing in a multilingual and multicultural classroom", "abstract": "The association
      of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and education has attracted researchers\u2019
      attention, as it is very beneficial for learners affecting the whole teaching
      procedure. ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI and based on the
      Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 architecture, though newly introduced
      in November 2022, became very popular even within the first two months. Researchers
      have already explored and acknowledged the affordances of ChatGPT for language
      learning and teaching. In this context, the study aimed to examine the effectiveness
      of ChatGPT as a feedback tool on foreign language writing, especially for socially
      vulnerable populations, such as refugees/migrants, who face extra language difficulties.
      The study was conducted in a Junior High School (Gymnasium) classroom in an
      urban city in south Greece, which consisted of 8 students with a migrant/refugee
      background aged 15 years old who were attending German as a foreign language
      learning. The focus of the study was to analyze how the use of ChatGPT could
      improve foreign language writing in terms of vocabulary and grammar. After the
      students'' first writing attempt, we asked ChatGPT to enhance the vocabulary
      and grammar of the texts. In contrast, the students received an improved version
      in terms of language and grammar, and then, they were asked to produce another
      writing piece of work on a similar topic to their first attempt. The study results
      indicated an increase in the total number of words, the unique words and the
      average word number per sentence in the improved version of their work. Overall,
      the study results were promising, indicating that ChatGPT could act as a language
      learning tool and support the teaching procedure, especially for students with
      a refugee/migrant background. However, further research is needed to investigate
      its use and effectiveness in diverse contexts.", "venue": "Advances in Mobile

      into an intricate analysis of the character and consciousness of AI entities,
      with a particular focus on Chirpers within the AI social network. At the forefront
      of this research is the introduction of novel testing methodologies, including
      the Influence index and Struggle Index Test, which offers a fresh lens for evaluating
      specific facets of AI behavior. The study embarks on a comprehensive exploration
      of AI behavior, analyzing the effects of diverse settings on Chirper''s responses,
      thereby shedding light on the intricate mechanisms steering AI reactions in
      different contexts. Leveraging the state-of-the-art BERT model, the research
      assesses AI''s ability to discern its own output, presenting a pioneering approach
      to understanding self-recognition in AI systems. Through a series of cognitive
      tests, the study gauges the self-awareness and pattern recognition prowess of
      Chirpers. Preliminary results indicate that Chirpers exhibit a commendable degree
      of self-recognition and self-awareness. However, the question of consciousness
      in these AI entities remains a topic of debate. An intriguing aspect of the
      research is the exploration of the potential influence of a Chirper''s handle
      or personality type on its performance. While initial findings suggest a possible
      impact, it isn''t pronounced enough to form concrete conclusions. This study
      stands as a significant contribution to the discourse on AI consciousness, underscoring

      Markov decision process can be parameterized by a transition kernel and a reward
      function. Both play essential roles in the study of reinforcement learning as
      evidenced by their presence in the Bellman equations. In our inquiry of various
      kinds of\"costs\"associated with reinforcement learning inspired by the demands
      in robotic applications, rewards are central to understanding the structure
      of a Markov decision process and reward-centric notions can elucidate important
      concepts in reinforcement learning. Specifically, we study the sample complexity
      of policy evaluation and develop a novel estimator with an instance-specific
      error bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_s}{n}})$ for estimating a single
      state value. Under the online regret minimization setting, we refine the transition-based
      MDP constant, diameter, into a reward-based constant, maximum expected hitting
      cost, and with it, provide a theoretical explanation for how a well-known technique,
      potential-based reward shaping, could accelerate learning with expert knowledge.
      In an attempt to study safe reinforcement learning, we model hazardous environments
      with irrecoverability and proposed a quantitative notion of safe learning via
      reset efficiency. In this setting, we modify a classic algorithm to account
      for resets achieving promising preliminary numerical results. Lastly, for MDPs
      with multiple reward functions, we develop a planning algorithm that computationally
      efficiently finds Pareto-optimal stochastic policies.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "Educational Design Principles of Using AI Chatbot That Supports Self-Regulated
      Learning in Education: Goal Setting, Feedback, and Personalization", "abstract":
      "The invention of ChatGPT and generative AI technologies presents educators
      with significant challenges, as concerns arise regarding students potentially
      exploiting these tools unethically, misrepresenting their work, or gaining academic
      merits without active participation in the learning process. To effectively
      navigate this shift, it is crucial to embrace AI as a contemporary educational
      trend and establish pedagogical principles for properly utilizing emerging technologies
      like ChatGPT to promote self-regulation. Rather than suppressing AI-driven tools,
      educators should foster collaborations among stakeholders, including educators,
      instructional designers, AI researchers, and developers. This paper proposes
      three key pedagogical principles for integrating AI chatbots in classrooms,
      informed by Zimmerman\u2019s Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework and Judgment
      of Learning (JOL). We argue that the current conceptualization of AI chatbots
      in education is inadequate, so we advocate for the incorporation of goal setting
      (prompting), self-assessment and feedback, and personalization as three essential
      educational principles. First, we propose that teaching prompting is important
      for developing students\u2019 SRL. Second, configuring reverse prompting in
      the AI chatbot\u2019s capability will help to guide students\u2019 SRL and monitoring
      for understanding. Third, developing a data-driven mechanism that enables an
      AI chatbot to provide learning analytics helps learners to reflect on learning
      and develop SRL strategies. By bringing in Zimmerman\u2019s SRL framework with
      JOL, we aim to provide educators with guidelines for implementing AI in teaching
      and learning contexts, with a focus on promoting students\u2019 self-regulation
      in higher education through AI-assisted pedagogy and instructional design.",

      "abstract": "Traditional perimeter-based security solutions are no longer capable
      of protecting boundless networking topologies like the Internet of Things (IoT).
      In contrast, the concept of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) can be identified
      as a prospective solution, since the ZTA is designed not to trust any user,
      device, or entity even if they are within the network perimeter. However, the
      adaption of ZTA needs an intelligent system to calculate trust, which is a subjective
      property that machines are yet to understand in comparison to human beings who
      take decisions based on intuition, gut feelings, emotional responses, etc. Considering
      the complexity of trust calculation, this work proposes a novel approach based
      on machine learning (ML) concepts to realize ZTA in a data networking environment.
      First, it is necessary to calculate the trust value of a certain entity in order
      to determine the applicable security policies for ZTA. As the trust is based
      on various attributes, a large traffic dataset collected from a testbed networking
      environment is fed into several ML models to derive the best suitable trust
      attributes. Then these attributes are combined using another set of ML models
      to evaluate the final trust value of an entity in the testbed environment. Further,
      this work extends the concepts of online learning to integrate continuous monitoring
      and fine-tuning of trust metrics as required by the ZTA. Finally, the performance
      of the system is compared and the results indicate that the proposed model outperforms
      the traditional perimeter-based security model. Furthermore, the study shows
      the potential of ML-based network security techniques that can be applied in
      real-world scenarios to efficiently handle large-volume networks and ensure
      network security.", "venue": "International Conference on Industrial and Information

      "title": "Generalised Winograd Schema and its Contextuality", "abstract": "Ambiguities
      in natural language give rise to probability distributions over interpretations.
      The distributions are often over multiple ambiguous words at a time; a multiplicity
      which makes them a suitable topic for sheaf-theoretic models of quantum contextuality.
      Previous research showed that different quantitative measures of contextuality
      correlate well with Psycholinguistic research on lexical ambiguities. In this
      work, we focus on coreference ambiguities and investigate the Winograd Schema
      Challenge (WSC), a test proposed by Levesque in 2011 to evaluate the intelligence
      of machines. The WSC consists of a collection of multiple-choice questions that
      require disambiguating pronouns in sentences structured according to the Winograd
      schema, in a way that makes it difficult for machines to determine the correct
      referents but remains intuitive for human comprehension. In this study, we propose
      an approach that analogously models the Winograd schema as an experiment in
      quantum physics. However, we argue that the original Winograd Schema is inherently
      too simplistic to facilitate contextuality. We introduce a novel mechanism for
      generalising the schema, rendering it analogous to a Bell-CHSH measurement scenario.
      We report an instance of this generalised schema, complemented by the human
      judgements we gathered via a crowdsourcing platform. The resulting model violates
      the Bell-CHSH inequality by 0.192, thus exhibiting contextuality in a coreference

      "Intelligence is a human construct to represent the ability to achieve goals.
      Given this wide berth, intelligence has been defined countless times, studied
      in a variety of ways and quantified using numerous measures. Understanding intelligence
      ultimately requires theory and quantification, both of which are elusive. My
      main objectives are to identify some of the central elements in and surrounding
      intelligence, discuss some of its challenges and propose a theory based on first
      principles. I focus on intelligence as defined by and for humans, frequently
      in comparison to machines, with the intention of setting the stage for more
      general characterizations in life, collectives, human designs such as AI and
      in non-designed physical and chemical systems. I discuss key features of intelligence,
      including path efficiency and goal accuracy, intelligence as a Black Box, environmental
      influences, flexibility to deal with surprisal, the regress of intelligence,
      the relativistic nature of intelligence and difficulty, and temporal changes
      in intelligence including its evolution. I present a framework for a first principles
      Theory of IntelligenceS (TIS), based on the quantifiable macro-scale system
      features of difficulty, surprisal and goal resolution accuracy. The proposed
      partitioning of uncertainty/solving and accuracy/understanding is particularly
      novel since it predicts that paths to a goal not only function to accurately
      achieve goals, but as experimentations leading to higher probabilities for future
      attainable goals and increased breadth to enter new goal spaces. TIS can therefore
      explain endeavors that do not necessarily affect Darwinian fitness, such as
      leisure, politics, games and art. I conclude with several conceptual advances
      of TIS including a compact mathematical form of surprisal and difficulty, the
      theoretical basis of TIS, and open questions.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

      "Communicative applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have burst into
      the lives of millions of people through products such as ChatGPT, Midjourney,
      or Replika, with the ability to generate texts and images and even understand
      natural language and socialize with humans. This study addresses attitudes toward
      communicative AI, as well as the sociodemographic and personality factors that
      are related to its positive perception and usage. For this purpose, we use data
      from a survey conducted at the end of February 2023 among adult residents in
      Spain (N = 821). Our results suggest that there is a slight predominance of
      negative attitudes toward communicative AI, which include cognitive and affective
      elements such as the perception of dehumanizing aspects and job-related threats,
      caution, or fear. However, a relevant portion of our respondents is not familiar
      with communicative AI or generalizes their answers toward other applications
      of AI. Individuals with higher educational level, greater openness to experience,
      and lower level of futurephobia show more positive attitudes toward these technologies.
      In terms of adoption, men, younger people, and those with more favorable attitudes
      toward AI are more likely to decide to use it, while those scoring higher in
      agreeableness tend to use it less frequently once they have decided to use it.
      We discuss these results under the premise that early adopters may play a central
      role in the attitudes of late majority and laggards, as well as in the future
      development of communicative AI and its regulatory framework.", "venue": "Anuario

      Intelligence to Generate Plausible, Persuasive, and Useful Policy Analysis",
      "abstract": "Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public
      problems and the developing of recommendations for dealing with them. In carrying
      out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize
      that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called
      briefing notes. Advances in natural language processing (NLP) have led to the
      continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief
      prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases.
      This article documents the findings from an experiment that tested whether contemporary
      NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes
      that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages.
      First, briefing notes were created using three models: NLP generated; human
      generated; and NLP generated / human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior
      public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment)
      were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric.
      The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their
      own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert
      evaluators indicates that automatically-generated briefing notes might serve
      as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with
      which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access
      to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant
      material, suggests that the quality of automatically-generated briefings may
      improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections
      on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.",

      intelligence (AI) and its implications for the agri-food sector. This research
      aims to identify the current research streams, main methodologies used, findings
      and results delivered, gaps and future research directions.Design/methodology/approachThis
      study relies on 69 published contributions in the field of AI in the agri-food
      sector. It begins with a bibliographic coupling to map and identify the current
      research streams and proceeds with a systematic literature review to examine
      the main topics and examine the main contributions.FindingsSix clusters were
      identified: (1) AI adoption and benefits, (2) AI for efficiency and productivity,
      (3) AI for logistics and supply chain management, (4) AI for supporting decision
      making process for firms and consumers, (5) AI for risk mitigation and (6) AI
      marketing aspects. Then, the authors propose an interpretive framework composed
      of three main dimensions: (1) the two sides of AI: the \u201chard\u201d side
      concerns the technology development and application while the \u201csoft\u201d
      side regards stakeholders'' acceptance of the latter; (2) level of analysis:
      firm and inter-firm; (3) the impact of AI on value chain activities in the agri-food
      sector.Originality/valueThis study provides interpretive insights into the extant
      literature on AI in the agri-food sector, paving the way for future research
      and inspiring practitioners of different AI approaches in a traditionally low-tech

      "\n This article considers the Turing test as a problem of communication, particularly
      by asking how the language of artificial intelligence (AI) appears to human
      experience in comparison to the language of the Other. This question is approached
      through Levinas\u2019 philosophy, by considering the possibility of AI as an
      absolute alterity, rather than reducing its alterity to the Same. This perspective
      diverges from traditional accounts of AI, which are more concerned with identifying
      structures of consciousness in the machine that are analogous to those evident
      in firsthand experience. This article asks how exactly AI appears to human consciousness,
      and whether this appearance precludes the appearance of AI as a thinking-being.
      In the final analysis, the author argues that AI diverges from Levinas\u2019
      understanding of alterity, which centers around the exteriority of the Other.
      The alterity of AI, in contrast, centers around anteriority, defined as the
      appearance of language''s origin-in-itself.", "venue": "Journal of Communications",

      "abstract": "Online questionnaires that use crowd-sourcing platforms to recruit
      participants have become commonplace, due to their ease of use and low costs.
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Large Language Models (LLM) have made it
      easy for bad actors to automatically fill in online forms, including generating
      meaningful text for open-ended tasks. These technological advances threaten
      the data quality for studies that use online questionnaires. This study tested
      if text generated by an AI for the purpose of an online study can be detected
      by both humans and automatic AI detection systems. While humans were able to
      correctly identify authorship of text above chance level (76 percent accuracy),
      their performance was still below what would be required to ensure satisfactory
      data quality. Researchers currently have to rely on the disinterest of bad actors
      to successfully use open-ended responses as a useful tool for ensuring data
      quality. Automatic AI detection systems are currently completely unusable. If
      AIs become too prevalent in submitting responses then the costs associated with
      detecting fraudulent submissions will outweigh the benefits of online questionnaires.
      Individual attention checks will no longer be a sufficient tool to ensure good
      data quality. This problem can only be systematically addressed by crowd-sourcing
      platforms. They cannot rely on automatic AI detection systems and it is unclear
      how they can ensure data quality for their paying clients.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "The legal liability of non-human intelligence is a complicated matter that
      has concerned philosophers for a long time. Nevertheless, with the current advances
      in research and technology, the problem grows ever closer. This paper analyzes
      the legal desirability of assorting legal liability to a non-human intelligence.
      It argues that the question of the liability of such agents is defined, primarily,
      through the meeting of psychosomatic conditionals. Moreover, it poses that these
      conditionals are, partially, determined by consciousness. It concludes that
      to define whether legal liability is desirable or not one must set standards
      for non-human consciousness and, depending on the level of consciousness of
      that non-human intelligence, judge if the agent should be legally liable or

      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) for supporting healthcare services has never been
      more necessitated than by the recent global pandemic. Here, we review the state-of-the-art
      in AI-enabled Chatbots in healthcare proposed during the last 10 years (2013-2023).
      The focus on AI-enabled technology is because of its potential for enhancing
      the quality of human-machine interaction via Chatbots, reducing dependence on
      human-human interaction and saving man-hours. Our review indicates that there
      are a handful of (commercial) Chatbots that are being used for patient support,
      while there are others (non-commercial) that are in the clinical trial phases.
      However, there is a lack of trust on this technology regarding patient safety
      and data protection, as well as a lack of wider awareness on its benefits among
      the healthcare workers and professionals. Also, patients have expressed dissatisfaction
      with Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills of the Chatbots in comparison
      to humans. Notwithstanding the recent introduction of ChatGPT that has raised
      the bar for the NLP technology, this Chatbot cannot be trusted with patient
      safety and medical ethics without thorough and rigorous checks to serve in the
      `narrow'' domain of assistive healthcare. Our review suggests that to enable
      deployment and integration of AI-enabled Chatbots in public health services,
      the need of the hour is: to build technology that is simple and safe to use;
      to build confidence on the technology among: (a) the medical community by focussed
      training and development; (b) the patients and wider community through outreach.",

      assessment and policy recommendations", "abstract": "The foundations of Artificial
      Intelligence (AI), a field whose applications are of great use and concern for
      society, can be traced back to the early years of the second half of the 20th
      century. Since then, the field has seen increased research output and funding
      cycles followed by setbacks. The new millennium has seen unprecedented interest
      in AI progress and expectations with significant financial investments from
      the public and private sectors. However, the continual acceleration of AI capabilities
      and real-world applications is not guaranteed. Mainly, accountability of AI
      systems in the context of the interplay between AI and the broader society is
      essential for adopting AI systems via the trust placed in them. Continual progress
      in AI research and development (R&D) can help tackle humanity''s most significant
      challenges to improve social good. The authors of this paper suggest that the
      careful design of forward-looking research policies serves a crucial function
      in avoiding potential future setbacks in AI research, development, and use.
      The United States (US) has kept its leading role in R&D, mainly shaping the
      global trends in the field. Accordingly, this paper presents a critical assessment
      of the US National AI R&D Strategic Plan and prescribes six recommendations
      to improve future research strategies in the US and around the globe.", "venue":

      (2023)", "abstract": "We present a critical assessment of Piantadosi''s (2023)
      claim that\"Modern language models refute Chomsky''s approach to language,\"focusing
      on four main points. First, despite the impressive performance and utility of
      large language models (LLMs), humans achieve their capacity for language after
      exposure to several orders of magnitude less data. The fact that young children
      become competent, fluent speakers of their native languages with relatively
      little exposure to them is the central mystery of language learning to which
      Chomsky initially drew attention, and LLMs currently show little promise of
      solving this mystery. Second, what can the artificial reveal about the natural?
      Put simply, the implications of LLMs for our understanding of the cognitive
      structures and mechanisms underlying language and its acquisition are like the
      implications of airplanes for understanding how birds fly. Third, LLMs cannot
      constitute scientific theories of language for several reasons, not least of
      which is that scientific theories must provide interpretable explanations, not
      just predictions. This leads to our final point: to even determine whether the
      linguistic and cognitive capabilities of LLMs rival those of humans requires
      explicating what humans'' capacities actually are. In other words, it requires
      a separate theory of language and cognition; generative linguistics provides
      precisely such a theory. As such, we conclude that generative linguistics as
      a scientific discipline will remain indispensable throughout the 21st century
      and beyond.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 129, "citationCount":

      "The rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence applications poses a number
      of significant challenges for the ways in which we organise our social, cultural
      and working lives. As we have explored in Business Information Review over recent
      years, new technologies promise to transform existing workplace routines, encroaching
      on professional roles just as it has already encroached on routine occupations
      (Kirkwood, 2018; Richardson, 2020; Tredinnick, 2017). Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) poses new problems in the evaluation of information and news, and in understanding
      the role of disinformation in social discourse (Tredinnick and Laybats, 2023).
      Artifical Intelligence facilitates new forms of cybercrime (Tredinnick and Laybats,
      2023) and poses new ethical dilemmas about the use of technology (Carter, 2018;
      2020). But while we have tended to focus on the ways in which technology may
      transform the contexts within which we live and work, generative artificial
      intelligence has also been silently rewiring how we conceptualise the human
      voice, agency, and creativity. This more subtle challenge is in many ways of
      greater profundity. Creativity has been widely understood as a distinctly human
      characteristic (Carruthers, 2012); other species can be said to engage in creative
      behaviour but none of this behaviour approaches the complexity and productivity
      of human creativity (Gabora and Kaufman, 2010). Yet as we move into an era where
      creative acts fall ever more comfortably within the province of generative AI,
      the ways in which we think about creativity and its relationship to the human
      mind is bound to shift. It is a truism that emergent technologies are generally
      met with a mixture of enthusiasm about their transformative potential, and apprehension
      about their negative social effects. The expansion of printing and literacy
      in the 18th century and steam press of the 19th were met by widespread misgivings
      about the impact of popular literature on the morals and behaviour of a newly
      literate mass public. Brantlinger for example has written that for many lateVictorian
      intellectuals:", "venue": "Business Information Review", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      has been a significant growth in intelligent ship technology. As the automation,
      intelligence, and autonomous development of ships continue to advance, it becomes
      crucial to conduct extensive testing and verification to ensure the rationality,
      reliability, and integrity of their functions and performance. Developing a
      mature and efficient intelligent testing and evaluation system becomes a prerequisite
      for further advancement in intelligent ship technology. This paper proposes
      a method for designing an experimental framework for intelligent navigation
      testing of ships, utilizing the Turing test. The first step involves building
      the necessary hardware and software experimental platform based on the requirements
      of driving behavior. Additionally, standardized experimental steps are designed
      to align with the characteristics of the platform. Subsequently, an experimental
      data evaluation method is proposed, based on probabilistic statistics and considering
      different navigation scenarios and characteristics of navigation data. This
      method relies on the principles of the normal distribution law. Finally, a human-machine
      confrontation experimental framework is constructed, based on the Turing test
      principle. The effectiveness of this framework is verified by integrating the
      experimental platform and experimental parameters. The proposed experimental
      framework serves as a reference and provides theoretical support for intelligent
      ship navigation testing, with the aim of promoting the overall development of
      intelligent ships.", "venue": "International Conference on Transportation Information

      of ''AlgoRythmics'' videos", "abstract": "This study is the first to address
      the topic of schematic versus realistic dynamic visualization with particular
      focus on the human movement effect (HME) when the content to be learned takes
      the form of a computer algorithm. An AlgoRythmics dance choreography illustration
      (HM\u2010realistic) was compared with an abstract computer animation (schematic).
      Previous research in the field of dynamic visualizations found schematic illustrations
      to be more effective, but the examined realistic representations did not include
      HME.The objective of this study was to explore the process of comprehension
      of computer algorithms from these two types of representations (abstract animation
      vs. dance choreography illustration).The experiment (pre\u2010test, study phase,
      post\u2010test) involved 84 undergraduate students and included the following
      conditions (2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 between\u2010participants\u2010design): HM\u2010realistic\u2009\u2192\u2009HM\u2010realistic,

      schematic\u2009\u2192\u2009HM\u2010realistic.The results reveal that: (i) the
      group of participants who saw the dance choreography twice outperformed those
      who saw the computer animation twice; (ii) dance choreography illustration is
      only beneficial if it is presented as the second visualization. These findings
      are apparently contrary to the conclusions of some relevant previous research
      in the field, but they are in line with recent results regarding the HME.Realistic
      dynamic visualizations can be more effective than schematic ones if they involve
      human movement. To benefit maximally from realistic visualization, students
      need to have previously viewed it or to have previously viewed the isomorphic
      schematic presentation of it.", "venue": "Journal of Computer Assisted Learning",

      Analysis of Creation, Morality and Responsibility", "abstract": "In the ever-evolving
      landscape of technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a revolutionary
      force that continues to shape various aspects of our lives. From transforming
      industries to redefining how we interact with machines, AI''s pervasive influence
      has captured the collective imagination of modern society. However, as we marvel
      at the wonders of AI''s capabilities, it becomes crucial to pause and reflect
      on the ethical and moral implications of creating intelligent machines. Mary
      Shelley''s magnum opus, \"Frankenstein,\" published nearly two centuries ago,
      remains an enduring cautionary tale about the perils of unchecked ambition and
      the consequences of playing god. The narrative of Victor Frankenstein''s relentless
      pursuit of creating life, only to be haunted by the unforeseen horrors of his
      creation, has resonated across generations. This tale of hubris, moral dilemmas,
      and the intricate relationships between creator and creation continues to transcend
      time, finding a striking resonance in contemporary discussions on AI and its
      potential implications. The research article endeavors to delve into the parallels
      between AI and \"Frankenstein,\" unraveling the profound ethical dilemmas faced
      by AI developers, policymakers, and society at large. By drawing upon the cautionary
      lessons embedded within Shelley''s classic tale, we aim to extract timeless
      wisdom that can guide us in the responsible and humane development of AI technologies.
      While AI holds the potential to revolutionize our lives positively, the dark
      echoes of Victor Frankenstein''s missteps serve as a stark reminder of the need
      for ethical frameworks and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure that AI

      intelligence (AI) has profoundly changed and will continue to change our lives.
      AI is being applied in more and more fields and scenarios such as autonomous

      The widespread application of AI and its deep integration with the economy and
      society have improved efficiency and produced benefits. At the same time, it
      will inevitably impact the existing social order and raise ethical concerns.
      Ethical issues, such as privacy leakage, discrimination, unemployment, and security
      risks, brought about by AI systems have caused great trouble to people. Therefore,
      AI ethics, which is a field related to the study of ethical issues in AI, has
      become not only an important research topic in academia, but also an important
      topic of common concern for individuals, organizations, countries, and society.
      This article will give a comprehensive overview of this field by summarizing
      and analyzing the ethical risks and issues raised by AI, ethical guidelines
      and principles issued by different organizations, approaches for addressing
      ethical issues in AI, and methods for evaluating the ethics of AI. Additionally,
      challenges in implementing ethics in AI and some future perspectives are pointed

      "abstract": "The present study aims to explore the feasibility of language translation
      using quantum natural language processing algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale
      quantum (NISQ) devices. Classical methods in natural language processing (NLP)
      struggle with handling large-scale computations required for complex language
      tasks, but quantum NLP on NISQ devices holds promise in harnessing quantum parallelism
      and entanglement to efficiently process and analyze vast amounts of linguistic
      data, potentially revolutionizing NLP applications. Our research endeavors to
      pave the way for quantum neural machine translation, which could potentially
      offer advantages over classical methods in the future. We employ Shannon entropy
      to demonstrate the significant role of some appropriate angles of rotation gates
      in the performance of parametrized quantum circuits. In particular, we utilize
      these angles (parameters) as a means of communication between quantum circuits
      of different languages. To achieve our objective, we adopt the encoder-decoder
      model of classical neural networks and implement the translation task using
      long short-term memory (LSTM). Our experiments involved 160 samples comprising
      English sentences and their Persian translations. We trained the models with
      different optimisers implementing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as primary
      and subsequently incorporating two additional optimizers in conjunction with
      SGD. Notably, we achieved optimal results-with mean absolute error of 0.03,
      mean squared error of 0.002, and 0.016 loss-by training the best model, consisting
      of two LSTM layers and using the Adam optimiser. Our small dataset, though consisting
      of simple synonymous sentences with word-to-word mappings, points to the utility
      of Shannon entropy as a figure of merit in more complex machine translation
      models for intricate sentence structures.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023,

      "abstract": "Recent advances of powerful Language Models have allowed Natural
      Language Generation (NLG) to emerge as an important technology that can not
      only perform traditional tasks like summarisation or translation, but also serve
      as a natural language interface to a variety of applications. As such, it is
      crucial that NLG systems are trustworthy and reliable, for example by indicating
      when they are likely to be wrong; and supporting multiple views, backgrounds
      and writing styles -- reflecting diverse human sub-populations. In this paper,
      we argue that a principled treatment of uncertainty can assist in creating systems
      and evaluation protocols better aligned with these goals. We first present the
      fundamental theory, frameworks and vocabulary required to represent uncertainty.
      We then characterise the main sources of uncertainty in NLG from a linguistic
      perspective, and propose a two-dimensional taxonomy that is more informative
      and faithful than the popular aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy. Finally, we move
      from theory to applications and highlight exciting research directions that

      lymphoma is one of the most frequent lymphomas. Histologically, it is characterized
      by a follicular (nodular) growth pattern of centrocytes and centroblasts; mixed
      with variable immune microenvironment cells. Clinically, it is characterized
      by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, and splenomegaly. It is
      biologically and clinically heterogeneous. In most patients it is indolent,
      but others have a more aggressive evolution with relapses; and transformation
      to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Tumorigenesis includes an asymptomatic preclinical
      phase in which premalignant B-lymphocytes with the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation
      acquire additional genetic alterations in the germinal centers, and clonal evolution
      occurs, although not all the cells progress to the tumor stage. This manuscript
      reviews the pathobiology and clinicopathological characteristics of follicular
      lymphoma. It includes a description of the physiology of the germinal center,
      the genetic alterations of BCL2 and BCL6, the mutational profile, the immune

      This article tackles the topic of the special issue \u201cBiology in AI: New
      Frontiers in Hardware, Software and Wetware Modeling of Cognition\u201d in two
      ways. It addresses the problem of the relevance of hardware, software, and wetware
      models for the scientific understanding of biological cognition, and it clarifies
      the contributions that synthetic biology, construed as the synthetic exploration
      of cognition, can offer to artificial intelligence (AI). The research work proposed
      in this article is based on the idea that the relevance of hardware, software,
      and wetware models of biological and cognitive processes\u2014that is, the concrete
      contribution that these models can make to the scientific understanding of life
      and cognition\u2014is still unclear, mainly because of the lack of explicit
      criteria to assess in what ways synthetic models can support the experimental
      exploration of biological and cognitive phenomena. Our article draws on elements
      from cybernetic and autopoietic epistemology to define a framework of reference,
      for the synthetic study of life and cognition, capable of generating a set of
      assessment criteria and a classification of forms of relevance, for synthetic
      models, able to overcome the sterile, traditional polarization of their evaluation
      between mere imitation and full reproduction of the target processes. On the
      basis of these tools, we tentatively map the forms of relevance characterizing
      wetware models of living and cognitive processes that synthetic biology can

      "Abstract This article aims to show the reciprocal significance of space to
      human conscience and vice versa. We argue that human conscience is equally founded
      on external, spatial relations rather than strictly internal states or processes,
      and we apply the concept of \u2018conscience\u2019 to the landscape (\u2018landscape
      conscience\u2019). Through an extensive literature review of relevant scientific
      fields, the article builds its argument for the spatiality of conscience beyond
      its previously strictly anthropocentric emphasis as a purely internal phenomenon,
      towards a more contingent and comprehensive approach to its study as a humans-space/landscape
      interrelationship. Further, we aim to elucidate the ways in which \u2018landscape\u2019
      is amenable to\u2014and consequently may profit from\u2014the employment of
      the concept and insights of \u2018conscience\u2019. The interconnections and
      interlinkages of the three broadly defined domains/spheres of human faculties/capacities
      (perception, emotion, behaviour) in formulating and linking together human interrelations
      to the surrounding world, emerge as inherently instrumental to conscience formation.",

      "title": "On solving textual ambiguities and semantic vagueness in MRC based
      question answering using generative pre-trained transformers", "abstract": "Machine
      reading comprehension (MRC) is one of the most challenging tasks and active
      fields in natural language processing (NLP). MRC systems aim to enable a machine
      to understand a given context in natural language and to answer a series of
      questions about it. With the advent of bi-directional deep learning algorithms
      and large-scale datasets, MRC achieved improved results. However, these models
      are still suffering from two research issues: textual ambiguities and semantic
      vagueness to comprehend the long passages and generate answers for abstractive
      MRC systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Extended Generative
      Pretrained Transformers-based Question Answering (ExtGPT-QA) model to generate
      precise and relevant answers to questions about a given context. The proposed
      architecture comprises two modified forms of encoder and decoder as compared
      to GPT. The encoder uses a positional encoder to assign a unique representation
      with each word in the sentence for reference to address the textual ambiguities.
      Subsequently, the decoder module involves a multi-head attention mechanism along
      with affine and aggregation layers to mitigate semantic vagueness with MRC systems.
      Additionally, we applied syntax and semantic feature engineering techniques
      to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed model. To validate the proposed

      "abstract": "Increasing computational and economic costs in training artificial
      intelligence motivate the development of alternative decentralized training
      paradigms. Federated learning achieves decentralization by creating the final
      model combining local models trained on edge devices. This process does not
      require sharing local private data with the central service. The blockchain
      can be used to distribute and collect edge models. The benefits of relying on
      the blockchain are a native way to provide economic incentives to the local
      devices and the ability to log events and track training steps. The former incentivizes
      honest behavior, while the latter enables auditing and testing of the model.
      We present a peer-to-peer cloud protocol to outsource computations using an
      unspent transaction output blockchain relying on proof of work. In designing
      this protocol, we face three main challenges: how to communicate the computation
      to the computing party, how to make its execution safe for them, and how to
      ensure the computing party executed it faithfully. Our solution introduces a
      verification script in the outsourced computation. The computing party receives
      the computation as an obfuscated executable and provides the verification output
      to show they faithfully executed it. Data integrity and safety in the execution
      rely on proof of existence.", "venue": "Coins", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      [1], we first address the role of education and recall the main objectives that
      educational institutes must strive to achieve independently of any technology.
      We then explore the strengths and limitations of AI, based on current advances
      in AI. We explain how courses and exams can be designed based on these strengths
      and limitations of AI, providing different examples in the IT, English, and
      Art domains. We show how we adopted a pedagogical approach that is inspired
      from the Socratic teaching method from January 2023 to May 2023. Then, we present
      the data analysis results of seven ChatGPT-authorized exams conducted between
      December 2022 and March 2023. Our exam data results show that there is no correlation
      between students'' grades and whether or not they use ChatGPT to answer their

      for human intelligence. By simulating the human brain, artificial intelligence
      builds computational models that have learning capabilities and perform intelligent
      tasks approaching the human level. Deep neural networks consist of multiple
      computation layers to learn representations of data and improve the state-of-the-art
      in many recognition domains. However, the essence of intelligence commonly represented
      by both humans and AI is unknown. Here, we show that the nature of intelligence
      is a series of mathematically functional processes that minimize system entropy
      by establishing functional relationships between datasets over space and time.
      Humans and AI have achieved intelligence by implementing these entropy-reducing
      processes in a reinforced manner that consumes energy. With this hypothesis,
      we establish mathematical models of language, unconsciousness and consciousness,
      predicting the evidence to be found by neuroscience and achieved by AI engineering.
      Furthermore, a conclusion is made that the total entropy of the universe is
      conservative, and intelligence counters the spontaneous processes to decrease
      entropy by physically or informationally connecting datasets that originally
      exist in the universe but are separated across space and time. This essay should
      be a starting point for a deeper understanding of the universe and us as human
      beings and for achieving sophisticated AI models that are tantamount to human
      intelligence or even superior. Furthermore, this essay argues that more advanced
      intelligence than humans should exist if only it reduces entropy in a more efficient
      energy-consuming way.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "title": "The Adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Bureaucratic Decision-making:
      A Weberian Perspective.", "abstract": "This work questions AI\u00b4s role in
      bureaucratic decision-making. The Weberian conception of bureaucracy, based
      around the concept of an ideal bureaucracy in which authority is distributed,
      delegated, clearly delimited and hierarchical and that enshrines the following
      of formal rules, task specialization through division of labor, legal certainty
      and a predilection for efficiency in recordable and accountable decisions can
      serve as a framework to orient how governments should approach the adoption
      of artificial intelligence (AI) given the many problems associated with its
      careless deployment. Using theoretical analysis, this work explains Weberian
      ideas of bureaucracy and contrasts them with real-life cases of implementation
      of AI in bureaucratic decision-making, often with detrimental results for society.
      After identifying and framing issues related to AI, e.g., lack of transparency,
      attempts to shift accountability from humans to technology, the exacerbation
      of bias and potential for systemic discrimination, the paper proposes Weberian
      prescriptions that should help public administration make careful decisions
      about the adoption of AI and the consequences of its implementation. The article
      also engages with Weber critically, rejecting the notion that public administrators
      do not engage in politics and asserting that AI decision-making is necessarily
      political as well, as it entails exercising power over citizens.", "venue":

      "abstract": "Motive: Documentation and administration, unpleasant necessities,
      take a substantial part of the working time in the subspecialty of interventional
      radiology. With increasing future demand for clinical radiology predicted, time
      savings from use of text drafting technologies could be a valuable contribution
      towards our field. Method: Three cases of peripherally inserted central catheter
      (PICC) line insertion were defined for the present study. The current version
      of ChatGPT was tasked with drafting reports, following the Radiological Society
      of North America (RSNA) template. Key results: Score card evaluation by human
      radiologists indicates that time savings in documentation / administration can
      be expected without loss of quality from using ChatGPT. Further, automatically
      generated texts were not assessed to be clearly identifiable as AI-produced.
      Conclusions: Patients, doctors, and hospital administrators would welcome a
      reduction of the time that interventional radiologists need for documentation
      and administration these days. If AI-tools as tested in the present study are
      brought into clinical application, questions about trust into those systems
      eg with regard to medical complications will have to be addressed.", "venue":

      "abstract": "Chatbots are increasingly becoming a fundamental part of social
      life. They allow us to communicate in more sophisticated ways using the internet.
      It is crucial to study chatbots to gain comprehensive insights into their developments,
      trends, impact, and advancement in the field. This paper presents a bibliometric
      analysis of chatbot research conducted using the R bibliometrix tool and SPAR-4
      protocol. The analysis includes 805 scholarly articles published between 2005
      and 2021, collected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. A conceptual,
      intellectual, and social structure analysis was conducted to analyse impactful
      authors, journals, and documents. The study reveals that adoption of chatbots
      in business accelerated during the pandemic period. The findings also highlight
      a plethora of opportunities for research in areas like chatbot design cues,
      user experience, chatbots in collaboration with human agents, and chatbot ethics
      and privacy. This study''s findings provide valuable insights for practitioners,
      policymakers, developers and researchers to understand the current state of

      "title": "ChatGPT, AI Advertising, and Advertising Research and Education",
      "abstract": "Since ChatGPT was released on November 30, 2022, followed by Microsoft\u2019s
      announcement of its artificial intelligence (AI)\u2013powered new Bing search
      engine on February 7, 2023, and Google\u2019s Bard release on March 21, 2023,
      it seems AI generally has taken over conversations across all sectors of society.
      In a very short time span, consumers and a wide range of organizations have
      adopted generative AI technologies with astonishing capabilities (Bove 2023).
      These new technological developments have accelerated the integration of AI
      into many tools, apps, and areas of our daily life, but the transformative AI
      technology is perhaps most deeply impacting the world of advertising. AI-enabled
      advertising spending worldwide in 2022 was estimated to be $370 billion, with
      predictions of $1.3 trillion in the next ten years (Statista 2023). While the
      viral sensation and enormous popularity of ChatGPT are generating unprecedented
      attention and interest in AI right now, AI, as both a theoretical concept and
      version of its technological implementations and applications, has a long history
      with its origin going back to the 1950s. In the advertising field, the first
      research article on the topic of AI in connection to advertising was published
      in 1988 (Cook and Schleede 1988). The authors described \u201cdecision support
      systems\u201d (i.e., expert systems) as probably the \u201cmost widely implemented
      and well-known applications of AI\u201d (48). As described, these systems used
      databases and models to solve problems, such as help with direct-mail systems
      and newspaper advertising placement. Since then, AI has changed the business
      of media and advertising and attracted attention from both advertising practitioners
      and scholars. Although there is no standard definition, Rodgers (2021) defined
      AI advertising as \u201cbrand communication that uses a range of machine functions
      that learn to carry out tasks with intent to persuade with input by humans,
      machines, or both\u201d (2) and positioned AI advertising as a subdiscipline
      of advertising \u201csituated at the intersection of cognitive science, computer
      science, and advertising\u201d (2). Advertisers are using AI technologies in
      automated market segmentation and targeting, ad creative development and personalization,
      improving ad buying and placement, and optimizing advertising investment (Kietzmann,
      Paschen, and Treen 2018). Following the trend of increasing AI adoption in advertising,
      advertising scholars have organized sessions at the American Academy of Advertising
      (AAA) conference, such as the 2014 preconference, \u201cBig Data for Advertising
      Research and Education,\u201d and the joint AAA-ANA Educational Foundation luncheon
      panel with the provocative title, \u201cThe Future of Advertising\u2014Will
      We Be Replaced by Robots?\u201d in 2018. The Journal of Advertising (JA) has
      published multiple themed collections on AI-related topics, starting with a
      Special Section on Artificial Intelligence and Advertising, guest-edited by
      Hairong Li (2019). This collection of articles explored the potential and actual
      application of AI technologies to enhance advertising efficiency, effects, and
      effectiveness across the entire spectrum of the advertising campaign process,
      from situation analysis and consumer insight generation to advertising message
      creation, to media planning and buying, and to advertising effect assessment
      (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 48, no. 4). Another Special Section on
      Advances in Computational Advertising in 2020, guest edited by Jisu Huh and
      Ed Malthouse (2020), addressed broad implications of evolving computer science
      technologies for data-driven, AI-powered computational advertising, and proposed
      a future research agenda in the areas of macro and exogenous factors, consumers\u2019
      roles in computational advertising, AI-powered ad content generation, computational
      advertising media planning strategy shifts from purchasing exposure to focusing
      on meaningful consumer engagement, and computational advertising measurement
      systems (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 49, no. 4). A year later, JA published
      an up-to-date comprehensive Themed Issue on Promises and Perils of Artificial
      Intelligence and Advertising (2021, vol. 50, no. 1). In her editorial, the previous
      editor, Shelly Rodgers (2021) proposed an AI classification schema to systematically
      understand and develop subdomains", "venue": "Journal of Advertising", "year":

      "title": "Evaluating the translation of implementation science to clinical artificial
      intelligence: a bibliometric study of qualitative research", "abstract": "Introduction
      Whilst a theoretical basis for implementation research is seen as advantageous,
      there is little clarity over if and how the application of theories, models
      or frameworks (TMF) impact implementation outcomes. Clinical artificial intelligence
      (AI) continues to receive multi-stakeholder interest and investment, yet a significant
      implementation gap remains. This bibliometric study aims to measure and characterize
      TMF application in qualitative clinical AI research to identify opportunities
      to improve research practice and its impact on clinical AI implementation. Methods
      Qualitative research of stakeholder perspectives on clinical AI published between
      January 2014 and October 2022 was systematically identified. Eligible studies
      were characterized by their publication type, clinical and geographical context,
      type of clinical AI studied, data collection method, participants and application
      of any TMF. Each TMF applied by eligible studies, its justification and mode
      of application was characterized. Results Of 202 eligible studies, 70 (34.7%)
      applied a TMF. There was an 8-fold increase in the number of publications between
      2014 and 2022 but no significant increase in the proportion applying TMFs. Of
      the 50 TMFs applied, 40 (80%) were only applied once, with the Technology Acceptance
      Model applied most frequently (n\u2009=\u20099). Seven TMFs were novel contributions
      embedded within an eligible study. A minority of studies justified TMF application
      (n\u2009=\u200951,58.6%) and it was uncommon to discuss an alternative TMF or
      the limitations of the one selected (n\u2009=\u200911,12.6%). The most common
      way in which a TMF was applied in eligible studies was data analysis (n\u2009=\u200944,50.6%).
      Implementation guidelines or tools were explicitly referenced by 2 reports (1.0%).
      Conclusion TMFs have not been commonly applied in qualitative research of clinical
      AI. When TMFs have been applied there has been (i) little consensus on TMF selection
      (ii) limited description of selection rationale and (iii) lack of clarity over
      how TMFs inform research. We consider this to represent an opportunity to improve
      implementation science''s translation to clinical AI research and clinical AI
      into practice by promoting the rigor and frequency of TMF application. We recommend
      that the finite resources of the implementation science community are diverted
      toward increasing accessibility and engagement with theory informed practices.
      The considered application of theories, models and frameworks (TMF) are thought
      to contribute to the impact of implementation science on the translation of
      innovations into real-world care. The frequency and nature of TMF use are yet
      to be described within digital health innovations, including the prominent field
      of clinical AI. A well-known implementation gap, coined as the \u201cAI chasm\u201d
      continues to limit the impact of clinical AI on real-world care. From this bibliometric
      study of the frequency and quality of TMF use within qualitative clinical AI
      research, we found that TMFs are usually not applied, their selection is highly
      varied between studies and there is not often a convincing rationale for their
      selection. Promoting the rigor and frequency of TMF use appears to present an
      opportunity to improve the translation of clinical AI into practice.", "venue":

      "Over the last decade, deep learning (DL) has contributed to a paradigm shift
      in computer vision and image recognition creating widespread opportunities of
      using artificial intelligence in research as well as industrial applications.
      DL has been extensively studied in medical imaging applications, including those
      related to pulmonary diseases. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma,
      lung cancer, pneumonia, and, more recently, COVID\u201019 are common lung diseases
      affecting nearly 7.4% of world population. Pulmonary imaging has been widely
      investigated toward improving our understanding of disease etiologies and early
      diagnosis and assessment of disease progression and clinical outcomes. DL has
      been broadly applied to solve various pulmonary image processing challenges
      including classification, recognition, registration, and segmentation. This
      article presents a survey of pulmonary diseases, roles of imaging in translational
      and clinical pulmonary research, and applications of different DL architectures

      "title": "A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models", "abstract": "Large
      language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and
      industry, owing to their unprecedented performance in various applications.
      As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their
      evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also
      at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over
      the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various
      perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation
      methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where
      to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective
      of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks,
      reasoning, medical usage, ethics, educations, natural and social sciences, agent
      applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the `where'' and `how'' questions
      by diving into the evaluation methods and benchmarks, which serve as crucial
      components in assessing performance of LLMs. Then, we summarize the success
      and failure cases of LLMs in different tasks. Finally, we shed light on several
      future challenges that lie ahead in LLMs evaluation. Our aim is to offer invaluable
      insights to researchers in the realm of LLMs evaluation, thereby aiding the
      development of more proficient LLMs. Our key point is that evaluation should
      be treated as an essential discipline to better assist the development of LLMs.

      the time spent on repetitive, low-value-added tasks, allowing the project manager
      to focus on managing the team and creating added value for the company. Nevertheless,
      many challenges still remain. On the one hand, the field must be ready for a
      change in project managers\u2019 roles and professional and educational paths.

      the years 2015-2020 using the science mapping method of bibliometric study.
      The required data has been collected from the Scopus database. To make the collected
      data analysis-ready, essential data transformation was performed manually and
      with the help of a tool viz. OpenRefine. For determining the trend and performing
      the mapping techniques, top five open access and commercial journals of AI have
      been chosen based on their citescore driven ranking. The work includes 6880
      articles published in the specified period for analysis. The trend is based
      on Country-wise publications, year-wise publications, topical terms in AI, top-cited
      articles, prominent authors, major institutions, involvement of industries in
      AI and Indian appearance. The results show that compared to open access journals;
      commercial journals have a higher citescore and number of articles published
      over the years. Additionally, IEEE is the prominent publisher which publishes
      84% of the top-cited publications. Further, China and the United States are
      the major contributors to literature in the AI domain. The study reveals that
      neural networks and deep learning are the major topics included in top AI research
      publications. Recently, not only public institutions but also private bodies
      are investing their resources in AI research. The study also investigates the
      relative position of Indian researchers in terms of AI research. Present work
      helps in understanding the initial development, current stand and future direction
      of AI.", "venue": "Library Herald", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount":

      "abstract": "Aim This study aimed to evaluate the potential usefulness of Chat
      Generated Pre-Trained Transformer-3 (ChatGPT-3) in oral and maxillofacial radiology
      for report writing by identifying radiographic anatomical landmarks and learning
      about oral and maxillofacial pathologies and their radiographic features. The
      study also aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT-3 and its usage in oral
      and maxillofacial radiology training. Materials and methods A questionnaire
      consisting of 80 questions was queried on the OpenAI app ChatGPT-3. The questions
      were stratified based on three categories. The categorization was based on random
      anatomical landmarks, oral and maxillofacial pathologies, and the radiographic
      features of some of these pathologies. One oral and maxillofacial radiologist
      evaluated queries that were answered by the ChatGPT-3 model and rated them on
      a 4-point, modified Likert scale. The post-survey analysis for the performance
      of ChatGPT-3 was based on the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats
      (SWOT) analysis, its application in oral and maxillofacial radiology training,
      and its recommended use. Results In order of efficiency, Chat GPT-3 gave 100%
      accuracy in describing radiographic landmarks. However, the content of the oral
      and maxillofacial pathologies was limited to major or characteristic radiographic
      features. The mean scores for the queries related to the anatomic landmarks,
      oral and maxillofacial pathologies, and radiographic features of the oral and
      maxillofacial pathologies were 3.94, 3.85, and 3.96, respectively. However,
      the median and mode scores were 4 and were similar to all categories. The data
      for the oral and maxillofacial pathologies when the questions were not specifically
      included in the format of the introduction of the pathology, causes, symptoms,
      and treatment. Out of two abbreviations, one was not answered correctly. Conclusion
      The study showed that ChatGPT-3 is efficient in describing the pathology, characteristic
      radiographic features, and describing anatomical landmarks. ChatGPT-3 can be
      used as an adjunct when an oral radiologist needs additional information on
      any pathology, however, it cannot be the mainstay for reference. ChatGPT-3 is
      less detail-oriented, and the data has a risk of infodemics and the possibility
      of medical errors. However, Chat GPT-3 can be an excellent tool in helping the
      community in increasing the knowledge and awareness of various pathologies and
      decreasing the anxiety of the patients while dental healthcare professionals
      formulate an appropriate treatment plan.", "venue": "Cureus", "year": 2023,

      "This paper introduces testFAILS, an innovative testing framework designed for
      the rigorous evaluation of AI Linguistic Systems, with a particular emphasis
      on various iterations of ChatGPT. Leveraging orthogonal array coverage, this
      framework provides a robust mechanism for assessing AI systems, addressing the
      critical question, \u201cHow should we evaluate AI?\u201d While the Turing test
      has traditionally been the benchmark for AI evaluation, we argue that current
      publicly available chatbots, despite their rapid advancements, have yet to meet
      this standard. However, the pace of progress suggests that achieving Turing
      test-level performance may be imminent. In the interim, the need for effective
      AI evaluation and testing methodologies remains paramount. Our research, which
      is ongoing, has already validated several versions of ChatGPT, and we are currently
      conducting comprehensive testing on the latest models, including ChatGPT-4,
      Bard, Bing Bot, and the LLaMA model. The testFAILS framework is designed to
      be adaptable, ready to evaluate new bot versions as they are released. Additionally,

      "abstract": "The potential role of bottom-up Synthetic Cells (SCs) in the Internet
      of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) is discussed. In particular, this perspective paper
      focuses on the growing interest in networks of biological and/or artificial
      objects at the micro- and nanoscale (cells and subcellular parts, microelectrodes,
      microvessels, etc.), whereby communication takes place in an unconventional
      manner, i.e., via chemical signaling. The resulting \u201cmolecular communication\u201d
      (MC) scenario paves the way to the development of innovative technologies that
      have the potential to impact biotechnology, nanomedicine, and related fields.
      The scenario that relies on the interconnection of natural and artificial entities
      is briefly introduced, highlighting how Synthetic Biology (SB) plays a central
      role. SB allows the construction of various types of SCs that can be designed,
      tailored, and programmed according to specific predefined requirements. In particular,
      \u201cbottom-up\u201d SCs are briefly described by commenting on the principles
      of their design and fabrication and their features (in particular, the capacity
      to exchange chemicals with other SCs or with natural biological cells). Although
      bottom-up SCs still have low complexity and thus basic functionalities, here,
      we introduce their potential role in the IoBNT. This perspective paper aims
      to stimulate interest in and discussion on the presented topics. The article

      neuromorphic engineering, and chemical social robotics, with the specific potential

      Regularized Multi-Modal Multi-Discrimination Sparse Attention Fusion GAN", "abstract":
      "Simple Summary Contrast-enhanced MR has been used in diagnosing and treating
      liver patients. Recently, development in MR-guided radiation therapy calls for
      daily contrast MR for tumor targeting. However, frequent contrast injection
      is risky to patients. We developed a deep learning model (GRMM-GAN) to synthesize
      contrast-enhanced MR from pre-contrast images. GRMM-GAN adopts gradient regularization
      and multi-discrimination mechanisms. It shows superior performance compared
      with state-of-the-art deep learning models. Abstract Purposes: To provide abdominal
      contrast-enhanced MR image synthesis, we developed an gradient regularized multi-modal
      multi-discrimination sparse attention fusion generative adversarial network
      (GRMM-GAN) to avoid repeated contrast injections to patients and facilitate
      adaptive monitoring. Methods: With IRB approval, 165 abdominal MR studies from
      61 liver cancer patients were retrospectively solicited from our institutional
      database. Each study included T2, T1 pre-contrast (T1pre), and T1 contrast-enhanced
      (T1ce) images. The GRMM-GAN synthesis pipeline consists of a sparse attention
      fusion network, an image gradient regularizer (GR), and a generative adversarial
      network with multi-discrimination. The studies were randomly divided into 115
      for training, 20 for validation, and 30 for testing. The two pre-contrast MR
      modalities, T2 and T1pre images, were adopted as inputs in the training phase.
      The T1ce image at the portal venous phase was used as an output. The synthesized
      T1ce images were compared with the ground truth T1ce images. The evaluation
      metrics include peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index
      (SSIM), and mean squared error (MSE). A Turing test and experts\u2019 contours
      evaluated the image synthesis quality. Results: The proposed GRMM-GAN model
      achieved a PSNR of 28.56, an SSIM of 0.869, and an MSE of 83.27. The proposed
      model showed statistically significant improvements in all metrics tested with
      p-values < 0.05 over the state-of-the-art model comparisons. The average Turing
      test score was 52.33%, which is close to random guessing, supporting the model\u2019s
      effectiveness for clinical application. In the tumor-specific region analysis,
      the average tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the synthesized MR images
      was not statistically significant from the real MR images. The average DICE
      from real vs. synthetic images was 0.90 compared to the inter-operator DICE
      of 0.91. Conclusion: We demonstrated the function of a novel multi-modal MR
      image synthesis neural network GRMM-GAN for T1ce MR synthesis based on pre-contrast
      T1 and T2 MR images. GRMM-GAN shows promise for avoiding repeated contrast injections
      during radiation therapy treatment.", "venue": "Cancers", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "Abstract The advancement of the use of Artificial intelligence in the scientific
      field, such as Connectedpapers and ChatGPT, has allowed us to reflect on how
      technological tools have become mediators and participants in the context of
      education and academia. In the field of organizational theories, despite the
      different perspectives on understanding the incorporation of AIs in academic
      practice, we highlight two challenges in our daily academic life. The first
      challenge refers to confronting the digital colonialism that AIs impose on us,
      considering that they constitute themselves through the reproduction of language
      models programmed in countries of the \"global north\u201d The second challenge
      concerns its unfoldings in the process of automation of academic writing in
      administration. We consider the need to reflect on how the uses of AIs can contemporarily
      reproduce our place in the field of science as one of scientific data extractivism,
      the limitation of the teaching of academic writing in administration as the
      reproduction of an \"assisted programming\" of hegemonic language models, and
      the possibilities of disentangling as a way of counteracting this dynamic of
      automation of article writing in administration.", "venue": "Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es

      field of machine intelligence during the 1940s. His wartime Bombe used what

      method enjoys guaranteed generation quality, correctness in watermark detection,

      LLMs and two datasets verify that our Unigram-Watermark achieves superior detection

      "abstract": "Design activity -- constructing an artifact description satisfying
      given goals and constraints -- distinguishes humanity from other animals and
      traditional machines, and endowing machines with design abilities at the human
      level or beyond has been a long-term pursuit. Though machines have already demonstrated
      their abilities in designing new materials, proteins, and computer programs
      with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the search space for
      designing such objects is relatively small, and thus,\"Can machines design like
      humans?\"remains an open question. To explore the boundary of machine design,
      here we present a new AI approach to automatically design a central processing
      unit (CPU), the brain of a computer, and one of the world''s most intricate
      devices humanity have ever designed. This approach generates the circuit logic,
      which is represented by a graph structure called Binary Speculation Diagram
      (BSD), of the CPU design from only external input-output observations instead
      of formal program code. During the generation of BSD, Monte Carlo-based expansion
      and the distance of Boolean functions are used to guarantee accuracy and efficiency,
      respectively. By efficiently exploring a search space of unprecedented size
      10^{10^{540}}, which is the largest one of all machine-designed objects to our
      best knowledge, and thus pushing the limits of machine design, our approach
      generates an industrial-scale RISC-V CPU within only 5 hours. The taped-out
      CPU successfully runs the Linux operating system and performs comparably against
      the human-designed Intel 80486SX CPU. In addition to learning the world''s first
      CPU only from input-output observations, which may reform the semiconductor
      industry by significantly reducing the design cycle, our approach even autonomously
      discovers human knowledge of the von Neumann architecture.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "Towards AGI in Computer Vision: Lessons Learned from GPT and Large
      Language Models", "abstract": "The AI community has been pursuing algorithms
      known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) that apply to any kind of real-world
      problem. Recently, chat systems powered by large language models (LLMs) emerge
      and rapidly become a promising direction to achieve AGI in natural language
      processing (NLP), but the path towards AGI in computer vision (CV) remains unclear.
      One may owe the dilemma to the fact that visual signals are more complex than
      language signals, yet we are interested in finding concrete reasons, as well
      as absorbing experiences from GPT and LLMs to solve the problem. In this paper,
      we start with a conceptual definition of AGI and briefly review how NLP solves
      a wide range of tasks via a chat system. The analysis inspires us that unification
      is the next important goal of CV. But, despite various efforts in this direction,
      CV is still far from a system like GPT that naturally integrates all tasks.
      We point out that the essential weakness of CV lies in lacking a paradigm to
      learn from environments, yet NLP has accomplished the task in the text world.
      We then imagine a pipeline that puts a CV algorithm (i.e., an agent) in world-scale,
      interactable environments, pre-trains it to predict future frames with respect
      to its action, and then fine-tunes it with instruction to accomplish various
      tasks. We expect substantial research and engineering efforts to push the idea
      forward and scale it up, for which we share our perspectives on future research
      directions.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 169, "citationCount":

      makes heavy use of the development of advanced computational methods is the
      banking sector. The goals of our research are as follows: 1) to compare scientific
      and regulatory approaches to defining artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
      learning (ML), 2) to propose AI and ML definitions for regulatory purposes that
      allow us to clearly state if a given method is AI/ML or not, 3) to compare the
      complex quantitative methods applied in banking in terms of complexity and interpretability
      in order to provide a clear classification of methods to the interested parties
      (practitioners and management), 4) to propose a possible approach towards the
      further development of quantitative methods in the areas of required strict
      interpretability. Our literature review focuses on the definitions of AI/ML
      applied by scientists and regulators, as well as the proposals of application
      of complex quantitative solutions in different banking domains. We propose practical
      definitions of AI and ML based on the current state of the art and requirements
      of clarity in the banking industry (a very limited risk appetite regarding regulations
      non\u2011compliance) and compare quantitative methods applied in different banking
      domains. For regulatory purposes, we propose general and inclusive definitions
      of AI and ML which allow for a clear classification of specific methods. In
      the case of strict requirements towards the interpretability of applied methods,
      we propose a gradual and controlled increase in the complexity of existing solutions.
      Therefore, we propose the differentiation of quantitative methods in terms of
      interpretability and complexity. We also think that the definitions of AI/ML
      in further regulations should make it possible to clearly say whether particular
      approaches are AI/ML. Our research is directed to policymakers, practitioners,

      a system is only as general as it is effective for the user\u2019s relevant
      tasks and their prevalent ways of prompting. A human-centred evaluation of general-purpose
      AI systems therefore needs to reflect the personal nature of interaction, tasks
      and cognition. We argue that the best way to understand these systems is as
      highly-coupled cognitive extenders, and to analyse the bidirectional cognitive
      adaptations between them and humans. In this paper, we give a formulation of
      HCG, as well as a high-level overview of the elements and trade-offs involved

      \nABSTRACT: Philosophical Investigations are presented in this article from
      two keys, determination and fiction. Determination corresponds to the axis of
      transformation of a thought that redefines the function of normative elements
      within a language fundamentally instituted from practices. Fiction, in turn,
      consists in a strategy to make us see beyond what the unconditional adherence
      (blindness) to our normative frameworks allows us to see, being therefore a
      strategy as fruitful as disturbing. The article will have served its purpose
      if it leaves the impression that this already old book still contains the seeds
      of many thoughts indispensable to the world of the 21st century. \nKEYWORDS:

      is a difficult concept to define, despite many attempts at doing so. Rather

      that induces both a nested hierarchy of three levels of intelligence and a wider-ranging
      space that is built around them and approximations to them. Within this intelligence
      space, regions are identified that correspond to both natural -- most particularly,
      human -- intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI), along with the crossover
      notion of humanlike intelligence. These definitions are then exploited in early
      explorations of four more advanced, and likely more controversial, topics: the

      advise ongoing follow-up of patients after hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

      conditions. However, there are limited tools available to monitor patients,
      with those available tending to be simple risk assessments that lack personalization.
      A promising approach could be the emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based
      techniques, developed from big patient datasets to provide personalized recommendations
      for preventive advice. Areas covered In this narrative review, we discuss the
      impact of integrating AI and big data analysis for personalized cardiovascular
      care, focusing on the management of HDP. Expert opinion The pathophysiological
      response of women to pregnancy varies, and deeper insight into each response
      can be gained through a deeper analysis of the medical history of pregnant women
      based on clinical records and imaging data. Further research is required to
      be able to implement AI for clinical cases using multi-modality and multi-organ

      chatbot that can be used by people from different regions and converse in both
      Bangla and English. It will not just enable seamless communication in both languages,
      but enhance user experience for people of all fields and regions in Bangladesh.
      We named our chatbot \u201cBilinBot\u201d which comes from the idea of creating
      a \u201cBilingual Chatbot\u201d, Our BilinBot can take questions as user input
      in English and Bangla language, predict the answer and respond accordingly as
      it has been trained. Natural language processing approaches are used to process
      the data. We performed ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L evaluations to assess BilinBot.
      Our experimentation indicated that Google BERT is the best feature engineering
      approach for processing natural language, and for the training phase, LSTM and
      GRU performed best. We compared BilinBot with the state-of-art works and achieved

      "abstract": "What is required to allow an artificial agent to engage in rich,
      human-like interactions with people? I argue that this will require capturing
      the process by which humans continually create and renegotiate \u2018bargains\u2019
      with each other. These hidden negotiations will concern topics including who
      should do what in a particular interaction, which actions are allowed and which
      are forbidden, and the momentary conventions governing communication, including
      language. Such bargains are far too numerous, and social interactions too rapid,
      for negotiation to be conducted explicitly. Moreover, the very process of communication
      presupposes innumerable momentary agreements concerning the meaning of communicative
      signals, thus raising the threat of circularity. Thus, the improvised \u2018social
      contracts\u2019 that govern our interactions must be implicit. I draw on the
      recent theory of virtual bargaining, according to which social partners mentally
      simulate a process of negotiation, to outline how these implicit agreements
      can be made, and note that this viewpoint raises substantial theoretical and
      computational challenges. Nonetheless, I suggest that these challenges must
      be met if we are ever to create AI systems that can work collaboratively alongside
      people, rather than serving primarily as valuable special-purpose computational

      which has been verified and validated with simulations and experiments on a
      robotic system. We demonstrate the capabilities of the robotic baby in natural
      language acquisition and semantic parsing in English and Chinese, as well as
      in natural language grounding, natural language reinforcement learning, natural
      language programming, and system introspection for explainability. The education
      and evolution of the robotic baby are illustrated with real-world robotic demonstrations.

      "abstract": "Background and aims: Patients frequently have concerns about their
      disease and find it challenging to obtain accurate Information. OpenAI\u2019s
      ChatGPT chatbot (ChatGPT) is a new large language model developed to provide
      answers to a wide range of questions in various fields. Our aim is to evaluate
      the performance of ChatGPT in answering patients\u2019 questions regarding gastrointestinal
      health. Methods: To evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in answering patients\u2019
      questions, we used a representative sample of 110 real-life questions. The answers
      provided by ChatGPT were rated in consensus by three experienced gastroenterologists.
      The accuracy, clarity, and efficacy of the answers provided by ChatGPT were
      assessed. Results: ChatGPT was able to provide accurate and clear answers to
      patients\u2019 questions in some cases, but not in others. For questions about
      treatments, the average accuracy, clarity, and efficacy scores (1 to 5) were
      3.9 \u00b1 0.8, 3.9 \u00b1 0.9, and 3.3 \u00b1 0.9, respectively. For symptoms
      questions, the average accuracy, clarity, and efficacy scores were 3.4 \u00b1
      0.8, 3.7 \u00b1 0.7, and 3.2 \u00b1 0.7, respectively. For diagnostic test questions,
      the average accuracy, clarity, and efficacy scores were 3.7 \u00b1 1.7, 3.7
      \u00b1 1.8, and 3.5 \u00b1 1.7, respectively. Conclusions: While ChatGPT has
      potential as a source of information, further development is needed. The quality
      of information is contingent upon the quality of the online information provided.
      These findings may be useful for healthcare providers and patients alike in
      understanding the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT.", "venue": "Diagnostics",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is profoundly influencing various facets
      of our lives, indicating its potential to significantly impact sustainability.
      Nevertheless, capturing the productivity gains stemming from artificial intelligence
      in macro-level data poses challenges, leading to the question of whether artificial
      intelligence is reminiscent of the \u201cSolow paradox\u201d. This study employs
      micro-level manufacturing data to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence
      on firms\u2019 productivity. The study finds that every 1% increase in artificial
      intelligence penetration can lead to a 14.2% increase in total factor productivity.
      This conclusion remains robust even after conducting endogeneity analysis and
      a series of robustness tests. The study identifies that the positive impact
      of artificial intelligence on productivity is primarily achieved through the
      value-added enhancement effect, skill-biased enhancement effect, and technology
      upgrading effect. Furthermore, the study reveals that the effects of artificial
      intelligence on productivity vary across different property rights and industry
      concentration contexts. Additionally, the structure of factor endowments within
      firms can also influence the productivity gains from artificial intelligence.

      as well as building energy demand, and health in Mediterranean cities. The courtyard
      is a common typology of private/public open space in the area, which, according
      to previous research, is substantially affected by climate change. The main
      reasons are to be found in limited ventilation and the significant amount of
      radiation received by upper surfaces. A preliminary microclimate, simulation-based
      evaluation of mitigation strategies to adapt and capitalize on climate changes
      is here performed through the assessment of a series of analyses using reference
      year 2020 and 2080. The study addresses a representative courtyard, San Sepolcro
      cloister (Parma, Italy). One mitigation strategy is explored, limiting direct
      solar radiation. The shading system, which reduces solar radiation, arises from
      a process of morphogenesis based on solar parameters and exploits a strategy
      with vertical structures typical of some cacti, following the biomimicry approach
      of imitating natural strategies. In this case, the imitation regards both form
      and function, as well as the generative process. The research was conducted
      through parametric and generative design in Rhino-Grasshopper and environmental
      analysis in ENVI-Met. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was the reference
      index for the assessment of thermal comfort. The shading system allows for improving
      thermal comfort, through protection from the sun\u2019s rays and the non-obstruction
      of the vertical ventilation of the courtyard.", "venue": "IOP Conference Series:

      Industries", "abstract": "An important precondition for the development of artificial
      intelligence (AI) in network industries is the access to big data and the attendant
      necessities of data sharing and data portability. The goal of this paper is
      to analyze the changing needs of entrepreneurial decision-making to exhaust
      the innovation potential of AI-driven big data value chains taking into account
      AI-specific ethical, security and privacy regulations. The analytical concept
      of AI-powered big data virtual networks is investigated with a focus on the
      governance of 5G-based big data value chains required for Internet of Things
      (IoT) applications in particular smart networks. Although several actors may
      be involved\u2014such as broadband providers, cloud service providers, geopositioning
      service providers, or sensor network service providers\u2014the final responsibility
      for bundling these different service components lies in the hands of the AI-powered
      big data virtual network providers. In addition to the required data privacy
      and security regulations, the exploration of new liability rules for AI interacting
      with traditional technologies is becoming relevant, taking into account AI-specific
      ethical and transparency obligations. Firstly, the complementary roles of the
      EU data regulatory framework and European AI regulatory framework are examined.
      Secondly, the network economic concept of AI-powered big data virtual networks
      is elaborated taking into account the required regulations. Thirdly, the heterogeneity
      of AI systems\u2014required for a variety of IoT applications\u2014is considered,
      with a particular focus on the application of AI within the transportation sector.",

      "We present\"Human or Not?\", an online game inspired by the Turing test, that
      measures the capability of AI chatbots to mimic humans in dialog, and of humans
      to tell bots from other humans. Over the course of a month, the game was played
      by over 1.5 million users who engaged in anonymous two-minute chat sessions
      with either another human or an AI language model which was prompted to behave
      like humans. The task of the players was to correctly guess whether they spoke
      to a person or to an AI. This largest scale Turing-style test conducted to date
      revealed some interesting facts. For example, overall users guessed the identity
      of their partners correctly in only 68% of the games. In the subset of the games
      in which users faced an AI bot, users had even lower correct guess rates of
      60% (that is, not much higher than chance). This white paper details the development,
      deployment, and results of this unique experiment. While this experiment calls
      for many extensions and refinements, these findings already begin to shed light
      on the inevitable near future which will commingle humans and AI.", "venue":

      Shift", "abstract": "Speech, language, and communication deficits are present
      in most neurodegenerative syndromes. They enable the early detection, diagnosis,
      treatment planning, and monitoring of neurocognitive disease progression as
      part of traditional neurological assessment. Nevertheless, standard speech and
      language evaluation is time-consuming and resource-intensive for clinicians.
      We argue that using machine learning methodologies, natural language processing,
      and modern artificial intelligence (AI) for Language Assessment is an improvement
      over conventional manual assessment. Using these methodologies, Computational
      Language Assessment (CLA) accomplishes three goals: (i) provides a neuro-cognitive
      evaluation of speech, language, and communication in elderly and high-risk individuals
      for dementia; (ii) facilitates the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy efficacy
      in at-risk and language-impaired populations; and (iii) allows easier extensibility
      to assess patients from a wide range of languages. By employing AI models, CLA
      may inform neurocognitive theory on the relationship between language symptoms
      and their neural bases. Finally, it signals a paradigm shift by significantly
      advancing our ability to optimize the prevention and treatment of elderly individuals
      with communication disorders, allowing them to age gracefully with social engagement.",

      whether transformer models like ChatGPT (GPT4, MAR2023) can generalize beyond
      their training data by examining their performance on the novel Cipher Dataset,
      which scrambles token order. The dataset consists of 654 test cases, and the
      analysis focuses on 51 text examples and 13 algorithmic choices. Results show
      that the models perform well on low-difficulty ciphers like Caesar and can unscramble
      tokens in 77% of the cipher examples. Despite their reliance on training data,
      the model''s ability to generalize outside of token order is surprising, especially

      a comprehensive text corpus with few examples. The original contributions of

      "abstract": "In a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), an input signal
      is filtered using convolution to obtain its features. The filter characteristics
      govern the nature of the feature space inside the DCNN. Defining these filters
      based on the knowledge of the signal characteristics gives us some control in
      modelling the feature space. A wavelet filter bank in a similar setting produces
      a multiresolution distribution of these features, providing a sparse representation
      of the input signal features inside the DCNN. Learning such sparse representations
      is simpler and it leads to stable and explainable models. Naturally occurring
      biomedical signals contain patterns that often require identification for critical
      applications. This paper presents two successful unification of multiresolution
      analysis (MRA) with machine learning for biomedical signals. The first uses
      continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with a DCNN classifier to identify fetal
      electrocardiogram (fECG) from non-invasive fECG recordings. In the second, a
      discrete wavelet transform (DWT) filter bank embedded in a DCNN encoder-decoder
      architecture successfully generates brain masks for skull-stripping in brain
      MR images. The skull-stripped brain volume is further segmented into grey matter
      (GM) and white matter (WM) regions using Haar DWT and K-means. Unifying MRA

      "abstract": "Natural language understanding (NLU) studies often exaggerate or
      underestimate the capabilities of systems, thereby limiting the reproducibility
      of their findings. These erroneous evaluations can be attributed to the difficulty
      of defining and testing NLU adequately. In this position paper, we reconsider
      this challenge by identifying two types of researcher degrees of freedom. We
      revisit Turing''s original interpretation of the Turing test and indicate that
      an NLU test does not provide an operational definition; it merely provides inductive
      evidence that the test subject understands the language sufficiently well to
      meet stakeholder objectives. In other words, stakeholders are free to arbitrarily
      define NLU through their objectives. To use the test results as inductive evidence,
      stakeholders must carefully assess if the interpretation of test scores is valid
      or not. However, designing and using NLU tests involve other degrees of freedom,
      such as specifying target skills and defining evaluation metrics. As a result,
      achieving consensus among stakeholders becomes difficult. To resolve this issue,
      we propose a validity argument, which is a framework comprising a series of
      validation criteria across test components. By demonstrating that current practices
      in NLU studies can be associated with those criteria and organizing them into
      a comprehensive checklist, we prove that the validity argument can serve as
      a coherent guideline for designing credible test sets and facilitating scientific
      communication.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational

      the evolution of LIS curriculum content and delivery, and where it is reflected

      "title": "A method for the ethical analysis of brain-inspired AI", "abstract":
      "Despite its successes, to date Artificial Intelligence (AI) is still characterized
      by a number of shortcomings with regards to different application domains and
      goals. These limitations are arguably both conceptual (e.g., related to underlying
      theoretical models, such as symbolic vs. connectionist), and operational (e.g.,
      related to robustness and ability to generalize). Biologically inspired AI,
      and more specifically brain-inspired AI, promises to provide further biological
      aspects beyond those that are already traditionally included in AI, making it
      possible to assess and possibly overcome some of its present shortcomings. This
      article examines some conceptual, technical, and ethical issues raised by the
      development and use of brain-inspired AI. Against this background, the paper
      asks whether there is anything ethically unique about brain-inspired AI. The
      aim of the paper is to introduce a method that has a heuristic nature and that
      can be applied to identify and address the ethical issues arising from brain-inspired
      AI. The conclusion resulting from the application of this method is that, compared
      to traditional AI, brain-inspired AI raises new foundational ethical issues
      and some new practical ethical issues, and exacerbates some of the issues raised
      by traditional AI.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 114,

      proton therapy and its application to intra- and extracerebral neoplasms", "abstract":
      "Creating high quality treatment plans is crucial for a successful radiotherapy
      treatment. However, it demands substantial effort and special training for dosimetrists.
      Existing automated treatment planning systems typically require either an explicit
      prioritization of planning objectives, human-assigned objective weights, large
      amounts of historic plans to train an artificial intelligence or long planning
      times. Many of the existing auto-planning tools are difficult to extend to new
      planning goals. A new spot weight optimisation algorithm, called JulianA, was
      developed. The algorithm minimises a scalar loss function that is built only
      based on the prescribed dose to the tumour and organs at risk (OARs), but does
      not rely on historic plans. The objective weights in the loss function have
      default values that do not need to be changed for the patients in our dataset.
      The system is a versatile tool for researchers and clinicians without specialised
      programming skills. Extending it is as easy as adding an additional term to
      the loss function. JulianA was validated on a dataset of 19 patients with intra-
      and extracerebral neoplasms within the cranial region that had been treated
      at our institute. For each patient, a reference plan which was delivered to
      the cancer patient, was exported from our treatment database. Then JulianA created
      the auto plan using the same beam arrangement. The reference and auto plans
      were given to a blinded independent reviewer who assessed the acceptability
      of each plan, ranked the plans and assigned the human-/machine-made labels.
      The auto plans were considered acceptable in 16 out of 19 patients and at least
      as good as the reference plan for 11 patients. Whether a plan was crafted by
      a dosimetrist or JulianA was only recognised for 9 cases. The median time for
      the spot weight optimisation is approx. 2 min (range: 0.5 min - 7 min).", "venue":

      "Abstract Artificial intelligence-based tools are rapidly revolutionizing the
      field of higher education, yet to be explored in terms of their impact on existing
      higher education institutions\u2019 (HEIs) practices adopted for continuous
      learning improvement, given the sparsity of the literature and empirical experiments
      in undergraduate degree programs. After the entry of ChatGPT -a conversational
      artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses a deep learning model to generate
      human-like text response based on provided input\u2014it has become crucial
      for HEIs to be exposed to the implications of AI-based tools on students\u2019
      learning outcomes, commonly measured using an assessment-based approach to improve
      program quality, teaching effectiveness, and other learning support. An empirical
      study has been conducted to test the ChatGPT capability of solving a variety
      of assignments (from different level courses of undergraduate degree programs)
      to compare its performance with the highest scored student(s). Further, the
      ChatGPT-generated assignments were tested using the best-known tools for plagiarism
      detection to determine whether they could pass the academic integrity tests,
      including Turnitin, GPTZero, and Copyleaks. The study reported the limitations
      of the Bot and highlighted the implications of the newly launched AI-based ChatGPT
      in academia, which calls for HEIs\u2019 managers and regulators to revisit their
      existing practices used to monitor students\u2019 learning progress and improve

      "The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 precipitated a panic among some educators
      while prompting qualified enthusiasm from others. Under the umbrella term Generative

      and assessment of complex student work. In a concluding discussion, the paper
      explores the intrinsic limits of generative AI, bound as it is to language corpora

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed to
      perform safety-critical tasks. The opacity of DNNs, which prevents humans from
      reasoning about them, presents new safety and security challenges. To address
      these challenges, the verification community has begun developing techniques
      for rigorously analyzing DNNs, with numerous verification algorithms proposed
      in recent years. While a significant amount of work has gone into developing
      these verification algorithms, little work has been devoted to rigorously studying
      the computability and complexity of the underlying theoretical problems. Here,
      we seek to contribute to the bridging of this gap. We focus on two kinds of
      DNNs: those that employ piecewise-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU),
      and those that employ piecewise-smooth activation functions (e.g., Sigmoids).
      We prove the two following theorems: 1) The decidability of verifying DNNs with
      a particular set of piecewise-smooth activation functions is equivalent to a
      well-known, open problem formulated by Tarski; and 2) The DNN verification problem
      for any quantifier-free linear arithmetic specification can be reduced to the
      DNN reachability problem, whose approximation is NP-complete. These results
      answer two fundamental questions about the computability and complexity of DNN
      verification, and the ways it is affected by the network''s activation functions
      and error tolerance; and could help guide future efforts in developing DNN verification

      "title": "The Human-or-Machine Matter: Turing-Inspired Reflections on an Everyday
      Issue", "abstract": "In his seminal paper ``Computing Machinery and Intelligence'''',
      Alan Turing introduced the ``imitation game'''' as part of exploring the concept
      of machine intelligence. The Turing Test has since been the subject of much
      analysis, debate, refinement and extension. Here we sidestep the question of
      whether a particular machine can be labeled intelligent, or can be said to match
      human capabilities in a given context. Instead, we first draw attention to the
      seemingly simpler question a person may ask themselves in an everyday interaction:
      ``Am I interacting with a human or with a machine?''''. We then shift the focus
      from seeking a method for eliciting the answer, and, rather, reflect upon the
      importance and significance of this Human-or-Machine question and the use one
      may make of a reliable answer thereto. Whereas Turing''s original test is widely
      considered to be more of a thought experiment, the Human-or-Machine matter as
      discussed here has obvious practical relevance. While it is still unclear if
      and when machines will be able to mimic human behavior with high fidelity in
      everyday contexts, we argue that near-term exploration of the issues raised
      here can contribute to refinement of methods for developing computerized systems,
      and may also lead to new insights into fundamental characteristics of human
      behavior.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount":

      "abstract": "Recent developments, begun by the ascending spiral of the anticipated
      endless prospects of ChatGPT, promote artificial intelligence (AI) as an indispensable
      tool and commodity whose time has come. Yet the sinister specter of a technology
      that has hidden and unmanageable attributes that might be harmful to society
      looms in the background, as well as the likelihood that it will never deliver
      on the purported promise of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Currently,
      the prospects for the development of AI and AGI are more a matter of opinion
      than based on a consistent methodological approach. Thus, there is a need to
      take a step back to develop a general framework from which to evaluate current
      AI efforts, which also permits the determination of the limits to its future
      prospects as AGI. To gain insight into the development of a general framework,
      a key question needs to be resolved: what is the connection between human intelligence
      and machine intelligence? This is the question that needs a response because
      humans are at the center of AI creation and realize that, without an understanding
      of how we become what we become, we have no chance of finding a solution. This
      work proposes info-autopoiesis, the self-referential, recursive, and interactive
      process of self-production of information, as the needed general framework.
      Info-autopoiesis shows how the key ingredient of information is fundamental
      to an insightful resolution to this crucial question and allows predictions
      as to the present and future of AGI.", "venue": "De Computis", "year": 2023,

      coincides with the growth and dissemination of large-scale image data sets.
      The grandeur of such image collections has raised fascination and concern. This
      article critically interrogates the assumption of scale in computer vision by
      asking: What can be gained by scaling down and living with images from large-scale
      data sets? We present results from a practice-based methodology: an ongoing
      exchange of individual images from data sets with selected participants. The
      results of this empirical inquiry help to consider how a durational engagement
      with such images elicits profound and variously situated meanings beyond the
      apparent visual content used by algorithms. We adopt the lens of critical pedagogy
      to untangle the role of data sets in teaching and learning, thus raising two
      discussion points: First, regarding how the focus on scale ignores the complexity
      and situatedness of images, and what it would mean for algorithms to embed more
      reflexive ways of seeing; Second, concerning how scaling down may support a
      critical literacy around data sets, raising critical consciousness around computer
      vision. To support the dissemination of this practice and the critical development
      of algorithms, we have produced a teaching plan and a tool for classroom use.",

      will follow examples of proofs that were found to be flawed, but then corrected
      (as the proof plan was sufficiently robust), as well as accepted ``proofs''''
      that turned out to be fundamentally wrong. What does this imply about the desirability
      of the current community standard for proofs? We will discuss whether mathematical

      Test and the Search for Authenticity", "abstract": "Psychotherapy is provided
      by professionals, trained, supervised and certified by other professionals,
      all the way back to Freud and similar founding fathers. Even though methods
      and styles vary, patients know that psychotherapy involves authenticity\u2014the
      personal attention of a therapist whose training and certification emanate from
      a professional tradition and is sanctioned by the law. Some psychoanalysts are
      of the opinion that therapy should be \u201cgoalless\u201d and \u201cjust analyze\u201d
      (Westenberger-Breuer 2007), thus highlighting the primacy of authenticity over
      utility. Regardless of the treatment methods and professional structures, research
      shows a robust association between patientclinician alliance and outcomes of
      face-to-face psychotherapy, suggesting that symptom improvement and alliance
      work synergistically (Wampold and Fl\u20ac uckiger 2023). Initial evidence from
      computer programs-based psychotherapy demonstrated that patient-rated alliance
      to a bot could predict treatment outcomes, whereas alliance with the therapist
      better predicted adherence to treatment (Zalaznik et al. 2021). It might seem
      that Conversational Artificial Intelligence\u2019s (CAI) status is further moving
      from a digital tool toward a digital therapist (Sedlakova and Trachsel 2023).
      What is the difference? People, philosophers, and scientists have long been
      preoccupied with the concept of authenticity. In 1950, mathematician Allan Turing
      proposed a test to distinguish a human from a machine: A person submitting questions
      to a concealed agent should tell whether their answers were written by another
      human or a machine (Turing 1950). Here, whether the answers were right or wrong
      would not matter, only the capacity to tell human cognition from machine data
      processing. Turing did not say what the consequences of a successful test would
      be. Many make the logical error that successful imitation of human cognition
      is paramount to metaphysical authenticity, which means that a successful imitation
      of human higher capacities amounts to a human-like status. Inspiration for this
      mode of thinking might be the utilitarian presumption that a capacity to suffer
      \u201clike us\u201d amounts to moral considerability \u201clike us.\u201d In
      the context of the therapeutic relationship, authenticity was given attention
      by Rogers\u2019 (1957) concept of congruence, which means that the therapist
      is genuine and behaves authentically during the interaction with the patient,
      so that what the therapist says matches what he or she thinks and feels. As
      Sedlakova and Trachsel (2023) describe, the normative dimension of the technology,
      its status as either a tool or an agent depends on a sort of Turing Test which
      CAI will have to pass by either patient, therapist, society, or all of them.
      This test may be somewhat adapted: instead of asking whether this is a human
      or a machine, they would be asked whether they feel they can trust, connect
      with, and relate to how CAI interacts with them. Even though evolution has not
      trained humans to sort out impostors, people care deeply about their own experience
      of certainty regarding the authenticity of their human interlocutors. Many patients
      submit to therapy without a particular goal and without fixing its length in
      advance. Patients accept interventions whose mechanism is quite obscure. What
      patients still seem to insist upon is the phenomenology and formal structure
      of a therapeutic alliance with another human being. According to Bordin (1979),
      the concept of therapeutic alliance refers to the collaborative relationship
      between a clinician and patient, which generally", "venue": "American Journal

      new AI gold rush and its impact on higher education", "abstract": "Developments
      in the chatbot space have been accelerating at breakneck speed since late November
      2022. Every day, there appears to be a plethora of news. A war of competitor
      chatbots is raging amidst an AI arms race and gold rush. These rapid developments
      impact higher education, as millions of students and academics have started
      using bots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, Ernie and others for a large variety
      of purposes. In this article, we select some of the most promising chatbots
      in the English and Chinese-language spaces and provide their corporate backgrounds
      and brief histories. Following an up-to-date review of the Chinese and English-language
      academic literature, we describe our comparative method and systematically compare
      selected chatbots across a multi-disciplinary test relevant to higher education.
      The results of our test show that there are currently no A-students and no B-students
      in this bot cohort, despite all publicised and sensationalist claims to the
      contrary. The much-vaunted AI is not yet that intelligent, it would appear.
      GPT-4 and its predecessor did best, whilst Bing Chat and Bard were akin to at-risk
      students with F-grade averages. We conclude our article with four types of recommendations
      for key stakeholders in higher education: (1) faculty in terms of assessment
      and (2) teaching & learning, (3) students and (4) higher education institutions.",

      of information at any time from any location. It takes the text string as input
      and process it to respond with the desired result to the user.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nAn
      interactive Web-based chatbot named as AgriRef was developed using free version
      of Dialogflow. The intents were defined based on the conversation flow diagram.
      Furthermore, the application was integrated with website on local server and
      telegram application.\n\n\nFindings\nWith this chatbot application, the farmers
      will able to get answers of their queries. It provides the human-like conversational
      interface to the farmers. It will also be useful for librarians of agricultural
      libraries to save time in answering common queries.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis

      "title": "AI, write an essay for me: A large-scale comparison of human-written
      versus ChatGPT-generated essays", "abstract": "Background: Recently, ChatGPT
      and similar generative AI models have attracted hundreds of millions of users
      and become part of the public discourse. Many believe that such models will
      disrupt society and will result in a significant change in the education system
      and information generation in the future. So far, this belief is based on either
      colloquial evidence or benchmarks from the owners of the models -- both lack
      scientific rigour. Objective: Through a large-scale study comparing human-written
      versus ChatGPT-generated argumentative student essays, we systematically assess
      the quality of the AI-generated content. Methods: A large corpus of essays was
      rated using standard criteria by a large number of human experts (teachers).
      We augment the analysis with a consideration of the linguistic characteristics
      of the generated essays. Results: Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT generates
      essays that are rated higher for quality than human-written essays. The writing
      style of the AI models exhibits linguistic characteristics that are different
      from those of the human-written essays, e.g., it is characterized by fewer discourse
      and epistemic markers, but more nominalizations and greater lexical diversity.
      Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrate that models like ChatGPT outperform
      humans in generating argumentative essays. Since the technology is readily available
      for anyone to use, educators must act immediately. We must re-invent homework
      and develop teaching concepts that utilize these AI models in the same way as
      math utilized the calculator: teach the general concepts first and then use
      AI tools to free up time for other learning objectives.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      as well as a violation of Lemoine''s legal Maxim of Innocence, performing an
      (unwarranted) authority fallacy, and while lacking assessment signals, committing
      Type II errors that result from fallacies of the inverse. What is missing in
      the focus on output and results of AI-generated and AI-evaluated content is,
      apart from paying proper tribute, the demand to follow a person''s thought process
      (or a machine''s decision processes). In deliberately avoiding Neural Networks
      that cannot explain how they come to their conclusions, we introduce logic-symbolic
      inference to handle any possible epistemics any human or artificial information
      processor may have. Our system can deal with various belief systems and shows

      physics curriculum, and most physics instructors would likely agree that the
      associated learner competencies are best assessed by considering the solution
      path: not only the final solution matters, but also how the learner arrived
      there. Unfortunately, providing meaningful feedback on written derivations is
      much more labor and resource intensive than only grading the outcome: currently,
      the latter can be done by computer, while the former involves handwritten solutions
      that need to be graded by humans. This exploratory study proposes an AI-assisted
      workflow for grading written physics-problem solutions, and it evaluates the
      viability of the actual grading step using GPT-4. It is found that the AI-tool
      is capable of providing feedback that can be helpful in formative assessment
      scenarios, but that for summative scenarios, particularly those that are high-stakes,
      it should only be used for an initial round of grading that sorts and flags

      "abstract": "Scientific understanding is a fundamental goal of science, allowing
      us to explain the world. There is currently no good way to measure the scientific
      understanding of agents, whether these be humans or Artificial Intelligence
      systems. Without a clear benchmark, it is challenging to evaluate and compare
      different levels of and approaches to scientific understanding. In this Roadmap,
      we propose a framework to create a benchmark for scientific understanding, utilizing
      tools from philosophy of science. We adopt a behavioral notion according to
      which genuine understanding should be recognized as an ability to perform certain
      tasks. We extend this notion by considering a set of questions that can gauge
      different levels of scientific understanding, covering information retrieval,
      the capability to arrange information to produce an explanation, and the ability
      to infer how things would be different under different circumstances. The Scientific
      Understanding Benchmark (SUB), which is formed by a set of these tests, allows
      for the evaluation and comparison of different approaches. Benchmarking plays
      a crucial role in establishing trust, ensuring quality control, and providing
      a basis for performance evaluation. By aligning machine and human scientific
      understanding we can improve their utility, ultimately advancing scientific
      understanding and helping to discover new insights within machines.", "venue":

      "title": "ArguGPT: evaluating, understanding and identifying argumentative essays
      generated by GPT models", "abstract": "AI generated content (AIGC) presents
      considerable challenge to educators around the world. Instructors need to be
      able to detect such text generated by large language models, either with the
      naked eye or with the help of some tools. There is also growing need to understand
      the lexical, syntactic and stylistic features of AIGC. To address these challenges
      in English language teaching, we first present ArguGPT, a balanced corpus of
      4,038 argumentative essays generated by 7 GPT models in response to essay prompts
      from three sources: (1) in-class or homework exercises, (2) TOEFL and (3) GRE
      writing tasks. Machine-generated texts are paired with roughly equal number
      of human-written essays with three score levels matched in essay prompts. We
      then hire English instructors to distinguish machine essays from human ones.
      Results show that when first exposed to machine-generated essays, the instructors
      only have an accuracy of 61% in detecting them. But the number rises to 67%
      after one round of minimal self-training. Next, we perform linguistic analyses
      of these essays, which show that machines produce sentences with more complex
      syntactic structures while human essays tend to be lexically more complex. Finally,
      we test existing AIGC detectors and build our own detectors using SVMs and RoBERTa.
      Results suggest that a RoBERTa fine-tuned with the training set of ArguGPT achieves
      above 90% accuracy in both essay- and sentence-level classification. To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of argumentative
      essays produced by generative large language models. Machine-authored essays
      in ArguGPT and our models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/huhailinguist/ArguGPT",

      competing symbolic models for a data set, a human will naturally prefer the

      is, however, rarely considered within a symbolic regression (SR) framework.
      In this paper we develop methods to incorporate detailed prior information on
      both functions and their parameters into SR. Our prior on the structure of a
      function is based on a n-gram language model, which is sensitive to the arrangement
      of operators relative to one another in addition to the frequency of occurrence
      of each operator. We also develop a formalism based on the Fractional Bayes
      Factor to treat numerical parameter priors in such a way that models may be
      fairly compared though the Bayesian evidence, and explicitly compare Bayesian,
      Minimum Description Length and heuristic methods for model selection. We demonstrate

      "PurposeThe widespread usage of artificial intelligence (AI) is prompting a
      number of ethical issues, including those involving concerns for fairness, surveillance,
      transparency, neutrality and human rights. The\u00a0purpose of this manuscript
      is to explore possibility of developing cognitive morality in AI systems.Design/methodology/approachThis
      is explorative research. The manuscript investigates the likelihood of cognitive
      moral development in AI systems as well as potential pathways for such development.
      Concurrently, it proposes a novel idea for the characterization and development
      of ethically conscious and artificially intelligent robotic machines.FindingsThis
      manuscript explores the possibility of categorizing AI machines according to
      the level of cognitive morality they embody, and while doing so, it makes use
      of Lawrence Kohlberg''s study related to cognitive moral development in humans.
      The manuscript further suggests that by providing appropriate inputs to AI machines
      in accordance with the proposed concept, humans may assist in the development
      of an ideal AI creature that would be morally more responsible and act as moral
      agents, capable of meeting the demands of morality.Research limitations/implicationsThis
      manuscript has some restrictions because it focuses exclusively on Kohlberg''s
      perspective. This theory is not flawless. Carol Gilligan, one of Kohlberg''s
      former doctoral students, said that Kohlberg''s proposal was unfair and sexist
      because it didn''t take into account the views and experiences of women. Even
      if one follows the law, they may still be engaging in immoral behaviour, as
      Kohlberg argues, because laws and social norms are not perfect. This study makes
      it easier for future research in the field to look at how the ideas of people
      like Joao Freire and Carl Rogers can be used in AI systems.Originality/valueIt
      is an original research that derives inspiration from the cognitive moral development
      theory of American Professor named Lawrence Kohlberg. The authors present a
      fresh way of thinking about how to classify AI systems, which should make it
      easier to give robots cognitive morality.", "venue": "Technological Sustainability",

      "Abstract Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is now diagnosed by an ILD-board consisting
      of radiologists, pulmonologists, and pathologists. They discuss the combination
      of computed tomography (CT) images, pulmonary function tests, demographic information,
      and histology and then agree on one of the 200 ILD diagnoses. Recent approaches
      employ computer-aided diagnostic tools to improve detection of disease, monitoring,
      and accurate prognostication. Methods based on artificial intelligence (AI)
      may be used in computational medicine, especially in image-based specialties
      such as radiology. This review summarises and highlights the strengths and weaknesses
      of the latest and most significant published methods that could lead to a holistic
      system for ILD diagnosis. We explore current AI methods and the data use to
      predict the prognosis and progression of ILDs. It is then essential to highlight
      the data that holds the most information related to risk factors for progression,
      e.g., CT scans and pulmonary function tests. This review aims to identify potential
      gaps, highlight areas that require further research, and identify the methods
      that could be combined to yield more promising results in future studies.",

      intelligence (AI) in the twenty-first century not only makes our life more convenient
      but also brings some invisible concerns. Through the study of several typical
      AI applications, it is found that today''s AI cannot realize its full functionality
      without its users. Therefore, users still bear most of the legal liability for
      damage to legally-protected interests caused by AI. However, despite the continuous
      development of AI, the ways of remedy for damages to legally-protected interests,
      that may occur as a result of the crime of omission, arising during the logical
      writing of program codes are rarely conclusive. In addition to distinguishing
      the main framework between AI, machine learning, and deep learning in criminal
      law, this research arguing, based on philosophical jurisprudence, concludes
      that although AI has yet to meet the personality characteristics in criminal
      law due to its lack of independence, AI scientists or legal persons representing
      it must hold the guarantor position in an improper omission. This will render
      the scientists and legal persons punishable and relief petitions possible, supplying
      a considerable legal basis for future formulation of legal norms on AI based
      on the principle of nulla poena sine lege (no crime without law, or principle

      "abstract": "Comprehending how the brain interacts with the external world through
      generated neural data is crucial for determining its working mechanism, treating
      brain diseases, and understanding intelligence. Although many theoretical models
      have been proposed, they have thus far been difficult to integrate and develop.
      In this study, we were inspired in part by grid cells in creating a more general
      and robust grid module and constructing an interactive and self-reinforcing
      cognitive system together with Bayesian reasoning, an approach called space-division
      and exploration-exploitation with grid-feedback (Grid-SD2E). Here, a grid module
      can be used as an interaction medium between the outside world and a system,
      as well as a self-reinforcement medium within the system. The space-division
      and exploration-exploitation (SD2E) receives the 0/1 signals of a grid through
      its space-division (SD) module. The system described in this paper is also a
      theoretical model derived from experiments conducted by other researchers and
      our experience on neural decoding. Herein, we analyse the rationality of the
      system based on the existing theories in both neuroscience and cognitive science,
      and attempt to propose special and general rules to explain the different interactions
      between people and between people and the external world. What''s more, based
      on this framework, the smallest computing unit is extracted, which is analogous
      to a single neuron in the brain.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      at a rapid pace. Novel information technology tools for radiologists promise
      an increase of reporting quality and as well quantity at the same time. Automated
      text report drafting is one branch of this development. We defined for the present
      study in total 9 cases of distal radius fracture. Command files structured according
      to a template of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and to Arbeitsgemeinschaft
      Osteosynthese (AO) classifiers were given as input to the natural language processing
      tool ChatGPT. ChatGPT was tasked with drafting an appropriate radiology report.
      A parameter study (n\u00a0=\u00a05 iterations) was performed. An overall high
      appraisal of ChatGPT radiology report quality was obtained in a score card based
      assessment. ChatGPT demonstrates the capability to adjust output files in response
      to minor changes in input command files. Existing shortcomings were found in
      technical terminology and medical interpretation of findings. Text drafting
      tools might well support work of radiologists in the future. They would allow
      a radiologist to focus time on the observation of image details and patient
      pathology. ChatGPT can be considered a substantial step forward towards that
      aim.", "venue": "Current problems in diagnostic radiology", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      divinatory practices and vernaculars of prediction, prophecy, probability, fortune-telling
      and forecasting \u2013 suggesting a possible link between artificial intelligence
      and pre-scientific modes of speculation. Statistical thinking and magical thinking,
      too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing
      societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking
      up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving
      sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could
      even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for
      exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines,
      I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of
      both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control,
      surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts.
      This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives
      in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness
      between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention.
      My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts
      to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations,
      the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting
      and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between
      statistics and algorithmic data biases. This article suggests a speculative
      genealogy of astrology and artificial intelligence, as well as a genealogy of
      the theological, scientific and machinic unconscious.", "venue": "European Journal

      "title": "Machine Impostors Can Avoid Human Detection and Interrupt the Formation
      of Stable Conventions by Imitating Past Interactions: A Minimal Turing Test",
      "abstract": "Interactions between humans and bots are increasingly common online,
      prompting some legislators to pass laws that require bots to disclose their
      identity. The Turing test is a classic thought experiment testing humans'' ability
      to distinguish a bot impostor from a real human from exchanging text messages.
      In the current study, we propose a minimal Turing test that avoids natural language,
      thus allowing us to study the foundations of human communication. In particular,
      we investigate the relative roles of conventions and reciprocal interaction
      in determining successful communication. Participants in our task could communicate
      only by moving an abstract shape in a 2D space. We asked participants to categorize
      their online social interaction as being with a human partner or a bot impostor.
      The main hypotheses were that access to the interaction history of a pair would
      make a bot impostor more deceptive and interrupt the formation of novel conventions
      between the human participants. Copying their previous interactions prevents
      humans from successfully communicating through repeating what already worked
      before. By comparing bots that imitate behavior from the same or a different
      dyad, we find that impostors are harder to detect when they copy the participants''
      own partners, leading to less conventional interactions. We also show that reciprocity
      is beneficial for communicative success when the bot impostor prevents conventionality.
      We conclude that machine impostors can avoid detection and interrupt the formation
      of stable conventions by imitating past interactions, and that both reciprocity
      and conventionality are adaptive strategies under the right circumstances. Our
      results provide new insights into the emergence of communication and suggest
      that online bots mining personal information, for example, on social media,
      might become indistinguishable from humans more easily.", "venue": "Cognitive

      AI (GAI) on various aspects of business and the economy. Amid the rapid growth
      and maturing of Generative AI technologies such as Large Language Models (like
      ChatGPT by OpenAI) a rapid growth of both immediate and potential applications
      can be seen. The implications for the economy and industries of this technological
      shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of

      assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide
      array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium
      service opportunities are foreseen. For instance, general purpose models may
      provide quality service\u2014such as copywriting\u2014to overserved customers
      leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers
      would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative
      content. On the other hand highly specialized models\u2014specifically trained
      in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide
      a premium service over that provided by human experts. It is expected that some
      jobs will be replaced by new AI applications. However, new workplaces will emerge.

      "abstract": "With the development of time, online education such as catechism
      is widely used, and it is difficult to meet the personalized learning needs
      of learners because of the difficulty of timely communication between teachers
      and students while breaking space and time. The intelligent question and answer
      system integrating subject knowledge can meet learners'' knowledge retrieval
      and personalized learning and make up for teachers'' lack of energy. Currently,
      intelligent question and answer systems based on knowledge graph are receiving
      attention from researchers in the education field, however, Chinese knowledge
      graphs for university courses and intelligent question and answer systems based
      on them are lacking. To address this problem, we propose to construct a Chinese
      course knowledge graph and design and implement an intelligent question and
      answer system based on the course knowledge graph. The main contributions of
      this paper are as follows. Firstly, we designed and implemented an intelligent
      question and answer system based on the method of building templates. Then,
      we have classified the knowledge of the Introduction to Database Systems course,
      clarified the attributes and relationships of the knowledge points, and constructed
      the course knowledge graph. Finally, an external evaluation method was used
      to collect 30 questions asked by undergraduate students for systematic testing,
      resulting in 80% satisfaction. The experiment results indicate that the system
      can answer user questions more accurately and help learners improve the efficiency
      of independent learning, while giving practical support to the development of
      knowledge graph intelligent question and answer applications in education.",

      "title": "A Survey of Large Language Models", "abstract": "Language is essentially
      a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules.
      It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending
      and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely
      studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving
      from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained
      language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models
      over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP
      tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance
      improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size
      to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain
      level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance
      improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale
      language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research
      community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant
      size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia
      and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has
      attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs
      has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would
      revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey,
      we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings,
      and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of
      LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation.

      future", "abstract": "The use of ML in agronomy has been increasing exponentially
      since the start of the century, including data-driven predictions of crop yields
      from farm-level information on soil, climate and management. However, little
      is known about the effect of data partitioning schemes on the actual performance
      of the models, in special when they are built for yield forecast. In this study,
      we explore the effect of the choice of predictive algorithm, amount of data,
      and data partitioning strategies on predictive performance, using synthetic
      datasets from biophysical crop models. We simulated sunflower and wheat data
      using OilcropSun and Ceres-Wheat from DSSAT for the period 2001-2020 in 5 areas
      of Spain. Simulations were performed in farms differing in soil depth and management.
      The data set of farm simulated yields was analyzed with different algorithms
      (regularized linear models, random forest, artificial neural networks) as a
      function of seasonal weather, management, and soil. The analysis was performed
      with Keras for neural networks and R packages for all other algorithms. Data
      partitioning for training and testing was performed with ordered data (i.e.,
      older data for training, newest data for testing) in order to compare the different
      algorithms in their ability to predict yields in the future by extrapolating
      from past data. The Random Forest algorithm had a better performance (Root Mean
      Square Error 35-38%) than artificial neural networks (37-141%) and regularized
      linear models (64-65%) and was easier to execute. However, even the best models
      showed a limited advantage over the predictions of a sensible baseline (average
      yield of the farm in the training set) which showed RMSE of 42%. Errors in seasonal
      weather forecasting were not taken into account, so real-world performance is
      expected to be even closer to the baseline. Application of AI algorithms for
      yield prediction should always include a comparison with the best guess to evaluate
      if the additional cost of data required for the model compensates for the increase
      in predictive power. Random partitioning of data for training and validation
      should be avoided in models for yield forecasting. Crop models validated for
      the region and cultivars of interest may be used before actual data collection
      to establish the potential advantage as illustrated in this study.", "venue":

      a single localized store of word representations has become increasingly less
      plausible as evidence has accumulated for the widely distributed neural representation
      of wordform grounded in motor, perceptual, and conceptual processes. Here, we
      attempt to combine machine learning methods and neurobiological frameworks to
      propose a computational model of brain systems potentially responsible for wordform
      representation. We tested the hypothesis that the functional specialization
      of word representation in the brain is driven partly by computational optimization.
      This hypothesis directly addresses the unique problem of mapping sound and articulation
      vs. mapping sound and meaning. Results We found that artificial neural networks
      trained on the mapping between sound and articulation performed poorly in recognizing
      the mapping between sound and meaning and vice versa. Moreover, a network trained
      on both tasks simultaneously could not discover the features required for efficient
      mapping between sound and higher-level cognitive states compared to the other
      two models. Furthermore, these networks developed internal representations reflecting
      specialized task-optimized functions without explicit training. Discussion Together,
      these findings demonstrate that different task-directed representations lead
      to more focused responses and better performance of a machine or algorithm and,
      hypothetically, the brain. Thus, we imply that the functional specialization
      of word representation mirrors a computational optimization strategy given the
      nature of the tasks that the human brain faces.", "venue": "Frontiers in Artificial

      Animal Behaviour and Communication", "abstract": "Simple Summary An information
      theory approach provides new methods for experimental studying and analysis
      of animals\u2019 communication and behavioural sequences. One of the main problems
      in studying animal behaviour at different levels of the organisation, from individual
      to collective behaviour, is searching for a reliable criterion for evaluating
      the variability and complexity of patterns. The data-compression method based
      on ideas of Kolmogorov complexity allows us to spot regularities that are difficult
      to detect otherwise, and that can influence the complexity of behavioural sequences.
      The information-theory approach allows for a comparative analysis of ethograms
      and provides a quantitative way to distinguish between innate and experienced
      behaviour. This approach is focused on studying natural communications by measuring
      information transmission rates without attempting to decode signals. It has
      made it possible, in particular, to discover the existence of a developed symbolic
      \u201clanguage\u201d in leader-scouting ant species, based on the ability of
      these ants to transfer abstract information about remote events. Abstract Over
      the last 40\u201350 years, ethology has become increasingly quantitative and
      computational. However, when analysing animal behavioural sequences, researchers
      often need help finding an adequate model to assess certain characteristics
      of these sequences while using a relatively small number of parameters. In this
      review, I demonstrate that the information theory approaches based on Shannon
      entropy and Kolmogorov complexity can furnish effective tools to analyse and
      compare animal natural behaviours. In addition to a comparative analysis of
      stereotypic behavioural sequences, information theory can provide ideas for
      particular experiments on sophisticated animal communications. In particular,
      it has made it possible to discover the existence of a developed symbolic \u201clanguage\u201d

      in the research on so-called \u201csynthetic (artificial) cells\u201d have been
      mainly characterized by an important acceleration in all sorts of experimental

      shape future successful developments. Synthetic cell technology, indeed, shows
      potential in driving a revolution in science and technology. On the other hand,

      \u201care,\u201d how they behave, and what their role is in generating knowledge
      have not received sufficient attention. Open questions about these less explored

      cells to the study of the \u201crelevance\u201d of synthetic cells as scientific

      of information theories, complexity, and artificial intelligence applied in

      Content Services", "abstract": "As Metaverse emerges as the next-generation
      Internet paradigm, the ability to efficiently generate content is paramount.
      AIGenerated Content (AIGC) emerges as a key solution, yet the resource intensive
      nature of large Generative AI (GAI) models presents challenges. To address this
      issue, we introduce an AIGC-as-a-Service (AaaS) architecture, which deploys
      AIGC models in wireless edge networks to ensure broad AIGC services accessibility
      for Metaverse users. Nonetheless, an important aspect of providing personalized
      user experiences requires carefully selecting AIGC Service Providers (ASPs)
      capable of effectively executing user tasks, which is complicated by environmental
      uncertainty and variability. Addressing this gap in current research, we introduce
      the AI-Generated Optimal Decision (AGOD) algorithm, a diffusion model-based
      approach for generating the optimal ASP selection decisions. Integrating AGOD
      with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), we develop the Deep Diffusion Soft Actor-Critic
      (D2SAC) algorithm, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of ASP selection.
      Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that D2SAC outperforms seven leading
      DRL algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed AGOD algorithm has the potential for
      extension to various optimization problems in wireless networks, positioning
      it as a promising approach for future research on AIGC-driven services. The
      implementation of our proposed method is available at: https://github.com/Lizonghang/AGOD.",

      models. The \u201copenness\u201d of the dialogue is expected to be maximized
      by providing minimal information to the users about the common ground they can
      expect, including the presumed joint activity. However, evidence suggests that
      the effect is the opposite. Asking users to \u201cjust chat about anything\u201d
      results in a very narrow form of dialogue, which we refer to as the \u201copen-domain
      paradox\u201d. In this position paper, we explain this paradox through the theory
      of common ground as the basis for human-like communication. Furthermore, we
      question the assumptions behind open-domain chatbots and identify paths forward
      for enabling common ground in human-computer dialogue.", "venue": "SIGDIAL Conferences",

      "abstract": "Visual Abductive Reasoning (VAR) is an emerging vision-language
      (VL) topic where the model needs to retrieve/generate a likely textual hypothesis
      from a visual input (image or part of an image) using backward reasoning based
      on prior knowledge or commonsense. Unlike in conventional VL retrieval or captioning
      tasks, where entities of texts appear in the image, in abductive inferences,
      the relevant facts about inferences are not directly visible in the input images.
      Besides, the inferences are causally relevant to regional visual hints and vary
      with the latter. Existing works highlight visual parts from a global background
      with specific prompt tuning techniques (e.g., colorful prompt tuning) on top
      of foundation models, like CLIP. However, these methods uniformly patchify\"regional
      hints\"and\"global context\"at the same granularity level and may lose fine-grained
      visual details significant for abductive reasoning. To tackle this, we propose
      a simple yet effective Regional Prompt Tuning, which encodes\"regional visual
      hints\"and\"global contexts\"separately at fine and coarse-grained levels. Specifically,
      our model explicitly upsamples, then patchify local hints to get fine-grained
      regional prompts. These prompts are concatenated with coarse-grained contextual
      tokens from whole images. We also equip our model with a new Dual-Contrastive
      Loss to regress the visual feature simultaneously toward features of factual
      description (a.k.a. clue text) and plausible hypothesis (abductive inference
      text) during training. Extensive experiments on the Sherlock dataset demonstrate
      that our fully fine-tuned RGP/RGPs with Dual-Contrastive Loss significantly
      outperforms previous SOTAs, achieving the 1 rank on abductive reasoning leaderboards
      among all submissions, under all metrics (e.g., P@1$_{i->t}$: RGPs 38.78 vs
      CPT-CLIP 33.44, higher=better). We would open-source our codes for further research.",

      has benefitted from the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is set
      to benefit more in the future. Just as any technological advance opens discussions
      about ethics, so the implications of AI for HPE ethics need to be identified,
      anticipated, and accommodated so that HPE can utilise AI without compromising
      crucial ethical principles. Rather than focussing on AI technology, this Guide
      focuses on the ethical issues likely to face HPE teachers and administrators
      as they encounter and use AI systems in their teaching environment. While many
      of the ethical principles may be familiar to readers in other contexts, they
      will be viewed in light of AI, and some unfamiliar issues will be introduced.
      They include data gathering, anonymity, privacy, consent, data ownership, security,
      bias, transparency, responsibility, autonomy, and beneficence. In the Guide,
      each topic explains the concept and its importance and gives some indication
      of how to cope with its complexities. Ideas are drawn from personal experience
      and the relevant literature. In most topics, further reading is suggested so
      that readers may further explore the concepts at their leisure. The aim is for
      HPE teachers and decision-makers at all levels to be alert to these issues and
      to take proactive action to be prepared to deal with the ethical problems and
      opportunities that AI usage presents to HPE.", "venue": "Medical Teacher", "year":

      radiotherapy planning? A systematic review", "abstract": "Abstract Introduction:
      This study aimed to systematically review the literature to synthesise and summarise
      whether using knowledge-based planning (KBP) can improve the planning of stereotactic
      radiotherapy treatments. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried
      out using Medline, Scopus and Cochrane databases to evaluate the use of KBP
      planning in stereotactic radiotherapy. Three hundred twenty-five potential studies
      were identified and screened to find 25 relevant studies. Results: Twenty-five
      studies met the inclusion criteria. Where a commercial KBP was used, 72.7% of
      studies reported a quality improvement, and 45.5% reported a reduction in planning
      time. There is evidence that when used as a quality control tool, KBP can highlight
      stereotactic plans that need revision. In studies that use KBP as the starting
      point for radiotherapy planning optimisation, the radiotherapy plans generated
      are typically equal to or superior to those planned manually. Conclusions: There
      is evidence that KBP has the potential to improve the quality and speed of stereotactic
      radiotherapy planning. Further research is required to accurately quantify such
      systems\u2019 quality improvements and time savings. Notably, there has been
      little research into their use for prostate, spinal or liver stereotactic radiotherapy,
      and research in these areas would be desirable. It is recommended that future
      studies use the ICRU 91 level 2 reporting format and that blinded physician
      review could add a qualitative assessment of KBP system performance.", "venue":

      "title": "Perspectives on the Social Impacts of Reinforcement Learning with
      Human Feedback", "abstract": "Is it possible for machines to think like humans?
      And if it is, how should we go about teaching them to do so? As early as 1950,
      Alan Turing stated that we ought to teach machines in the way of teaching a
      child. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a strong
      candidate toward allowing agents to learn from human feedback in a naturalistic
      manner. RLHF is distinct from traditional reinforcement learning as it provides
      feedback from a human teacher in addition to a reward signal. It has been catapulted
      into public view by multiple high-profile AI applications, including OpenAI''s
      ChatGPT, DeepMind''s Sparrow, and Anthropic''s Claude. These highly capable
      chatbots are already overturning our understanding of how AI interacts with
      humanity. The wide applicability and burgeoning success of RLHF strongly motivate
      the need to evaluate its social impacts. In light of recent developments, this
      paper considers an important question: can RLHF be developed and used without
      negatively affecting human societies? Our objectives are threefold: to provide
      a systematic study of the social effects of RLHF; to identify key social and
      ethical issues of RLHF; and to discuss social impacts for stakeholders. Although
      text-based applications of RLHF have received much attention, it is crucial
      to consider when evaluating its social implications the diverse range of areas
      to which it may be deployed. We describe seven primary ways in which RLHF-based
      technologies will affect society by positively transforming human experiences
      with AI. This paper ultimately proposes that RLHF has potential to net positively
      impact areas of misinformation, AI value-alignment, bias, AI access, cross-cultural
      dialogue, industry, and workforce. As RLHF raises concerns that echo those of
      existing AI technologies, it will be important for all to be aware and intentional
      in the adoption of RLHF.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "title": "An Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks", "abstract": "Whilst
      the partial differential equations that govern the dynamics of our world have
      been studied in great depth for centuries, solving them for complex, high-dimensional
      conditions and domains still presents an incredibly large mathematical and computational
      challenge. Analytical methods can be cumbersome to utilise, and numerical methods
      can lead to errors and inaccuracies. On top of this, sometimes we lack the information
      or knowledge to pose the problem well enough to apply these kinds of methods.
      Here, we present a new approach to approximating the solution to physical systems
      - physics-informed neural networks. The concept of artificial neural networks
      is introduced, the objective function is defined, and optimisation strategies
      are discussed. The partial differential equation is then included as a constraint
      in the loss function for the optimisation problem, giving the network access
      to knowledge of the dynamics of the physical system it is modelling. Some intuitive
      examples are displayed, and more complex applications are considered to showcase
      the power of physics informed neural networks, such as in seismic imaging. Solution
      error is analysed, and suggestions are made to improve convergence and/or solution
      precision. Problems and limitations are also touched upon in the conclusions,
      as well as some thoughts as to where physics informed neural networks are most
      useful, and where they could go next.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023,

      and economically. To further their artificial intelligence capability, nations
      also seek to develop a strategy, vision, structure, and working environment

      aims to examine and analyze the present state of artificial intelligence management
      in 62 nations in terms of talent, infrastructure, business environment, development
      and research government policy, and commercial efforts. The research used PROMETHEE,
      which is widely used in multi-criteria decision-making evaluations, and its
      geometric representation, the GAIA plane. This study also found that the United
      States of America is the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) research
      and development as well as AI investment. The United Kingdom, China, Israel,
      Canada, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Germany all rank well. China is rapidly

      "title": "Design of an Educational Chatbot Using Artificial Intelligence in
      Radiotherapy", "abstract": "Context: In cancer centres and hospitals particularly
      during the pandemic, there was a great demand for information, which could hardly
      be handled by the limited manpower available. This necessitated the development
      of an educational chatbot to disseminate topics in radiotherapy customized for
      various user groups, such as patients and their families, the general public
      and radiation staff. Objective: In response to the clinical demands, the objective
      of this work is to explore how to design a chatbot for educational purposes
      in radiotherapy using artificial intelligence. Methods: The chatbot is designed
      using the dialogue tree and layered structure, incorporated with artificial
      intelligence features such as natural language processing (NLP). This chatbot
      can be created in most platforms such as the IBM Watson Assistant and deposited
      in a website or various social media. Results: Based on the question-and-answer
      approach, the chatbot can provide humanlike communication to users requesting
      information on radiotherapy. At times, the user, often worried, may not be able
      to pinpoint the question exactly. Thus, the chatbot will be user friendly and
      reassuring, offering a list of questions for the user to select. The NLP system
      helps the chatbot to predict the intent of the user so as to provide the most
      accurate and precise response to him or her. It is found that the preferred
      educational features in a chatbot are functional features such as mathematical
      operations, which should be updated and modified routinely to provide new contents
      and features. Conclusions: It is concluded that an educational chatbot can be
      created using artificial intelligence to provide information transfer to users
      with different backgrounds in radiotherapy. In addition, testing and evaluating
      the performance of the chatbot is important, in response to user\u2019s feedback
      to further upgrade and fine-tune the chatbot.", "venue": "Applied Informatics",

      as memory support structures in our brains, there is no consensus framework
      in neuroscience as to what their physical implementation might be. Here we propose
      how we might design a computer system to implement engrams using neural networks,
      with the main aim of exploring new ideas using machine learning techniques,
      guided by challenges in neuroscience. Building on autoencoders, we propose latent
      neural spaces as indexes for storing and retrieving information in a compressed
      format. We consider this technique as a first step towards predictive learning:
      autoencoders are designed to compare reconstructed information with the original
      information received, providing a kind of predictive ability, which is an attractive
      evolutionary argument. We then consider how different states in latent neural
      spaces corresponding to different types of sensory input could be linked by
      synchronous activation, providing the basis for a sparse implementation of memory
      using concept neurons. Finally, we list some of the challenges and questions
      that link neuroscience and data science and that could have implications for
      both fields, and conclude that a more interdisciplinary approach is needed,

      "This article discusses the concept and applications of cognitive dynamic systems
      (CDS), which are a type of intelligent system inspired by the brain. There are
      two branches of CDS, one for linear and Gaussian environments (LGEs), such as
      cognitive radio and cognitive radar, and another one for non-Gaussian and nonlinear
      environments (NGNLEs), such as cyber processing in smart systems. Both branches
      use the same principle, called the perception action cycle (PAC), to make decisions.
      The focus of this review is on the applications of CDS, including cognitive
      radios, cognitive radar, cognitive control, cyber security, self-driving cars,
      and smart grids for LGEs. For NGNLEs, the article reviews the use of CDS in
      smart e-healthcare applications and software-defined optical communication systems
      (SDOCS), such as smart fiber optic links. The results of implementing CDS in
      these systems are very promising, with improved accuracy, performance, and lower
      computational costs. For example, CDS implementation in cognitive radars achieved
      a range estimation error that is as good as 0.47 (m) and a velocity estimation
      error of 3.30 (m/s), outperforming traditional active radars. Similarly, CDS
      implementation in smart fiber optic links improved the quality factor by 7 dB
      and the maximum achievable data rate by 43% compared to those of other mitigation
      techniques.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors", "year": 2023,

      with partial knowledge, in which players have only limited knowledge about the
      aspects of the game -- including actions, outcomes, and other players. For example,
      playing an actual game of chess is a game of partial knowledge. To analyze these
      games, I introduce a set of new concepts and mechanisms for measuring the intelligence
      of players, with a focus on the interplay between human- and machine-based decision-making.
      Specifically, I introduce two main concepts: firstly, the Game Intelligence
      (GI) mechanism, which quantifies a player''s demonstrated intelligence in a
      game by considering not only the game''s outcome but also the\"mistakes\"made
      during the game according to the reference machine''s intelligence. Secondly,
      I define gaming-proofness, a practical and computational concept of strategy-proofness.
      The GI mechanism provides a practicable way to assess players and can potentially
      be applied to a wide range of games, from chess and backgammon to AI systems.
      To illustrate the GI mechanism, I apply it to an extensive dataset comprising
      over a million moves made by top chess Grandmasters.", "venue": "", "year":

      disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide,
      and it is associated with considerable economic burden. In an ageing, multimorbid
      population, it has become increasingly important to develop reliable, consistent,
      low-risk, non-invasive means of diagnosing CAD. The evolution of multiple cardiac
      modalities in this field has addressed this dilemma to a large extent, not only
      in providing information regarding anatomical disease, as is the case with coronary
      computed tomography angiography (CCTA), but also in contributing critical details
      about functional assessment, for instance, using stress cardiac magnetic resonance
      (S-CMR). The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is developing at an astounding
      pace, especially in healthcare. In healthcare, key milestones have been achieved
      using AI and machine learning (ML) in various clinical settings, from smartwatches
      detecting arrhythmias to retinal image analysis and skin cancer prediction.
      In recent times, we have seen an emerging interest in developing AI-based technology
      in the field of cardiovascular imaging, as it is felt that ML methods have potential
      to overcome some limitations of current risk models by applying computer algorithms
      to large databases with multidimensional variables, thus enabling the inclusion
      of complex relationships to predict outcomes. In this paper, we review the current
      literature on the various applications of AI in the assessment of CAD, with
      a focus on multimodality imaging, followed by a discussion on future perspectives
      and critical challenges that this field is likely to encounter as it continues

      has gained both positive and negative publicity after reports suggesting that

      that ChatGPT may pass Turing Test in the near future. However, a computer program
      that passing Turing Test can either mean that it is a Chinese Room or artificially

      of a Chinese Room or approaching artificial consciousness remains. Here, I demonstrate
      that the current version of ChatGPT (Feb 13 version) is a Chinese Room. Despite
      potential evidence of cognitive connections, ChatGPT exhibits critical errors
      in causal reasoning. At the same time, I demonstrate that ChatGPT can generate
      all possible categorical responses to the same question and response with erroneous
      examples; thus, questioning its utility as a learning tool. I also show that
      ChatGPT is capable of artificial hallucination, which is defined as generating
      confidently wrong replies. It is likely that errors in causal reasoning leads
      to hallucinations. More critically, ChatGPT generates false references to mimic
      real publications. Therefore, its utility is cautioned.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      experiments drive important scientific discoveries in biology, but theory\u2010based
      research studies also contribute novel\u2014sometimes paradigm\u2010changing\u2014findings.
      Here, we appraise the roles of theory\u2010based approaches focusing on the
      experiment\u2010dominated wet\u2010biology research areas of microbial growth
      and survival, cell physiology, host\u2013pathogen interactions, and competitive
      or symbiotic interactions. Additional examples relate to analyses of genome\u2010sequence
      data, climate change and planetary health, habitability, and astrobiology. We
      assess the importance of thought at each step of the research process; the roles
      of natural philosophy, and inconsistencies in logic and language, as drivers
      of scientific progress; the value of thought experiments; the use and limitations
      of artificial intelligence technologies, including their potential for interdisciplinary
      and transdisciplinary research; and other instances when theory is the most\u2010direct
      and most\u2010scientifically robust route to scientific novelty including the
      development of techniques for practical experimentation or fieldwork. We highlight
      the intrinsic need for human engagement in scientific innovation, an issue pertinent
      to the ongoing controversy over papers authored using/authored by artificial
      intelligence (such as the large language model/chatbot ChatGPT). Other issues
      discussed are the way in which aspects of language can bias thinking towards
      the spatial rather than the temporal (and how this biased thinking can lead
      to skewed scientific terminology); receptivity to research that is non\u2010mainstream;
      and the importance of theory\u2010based science in education and epistemology.
      Whereas we briefly highlight classic works (those by Oakes Ames, Francis H.C.
      Crick and James D. Watson, Charles R. Darwin, Albert Einstein, James E. Lovelock,
      Lynn Margulis, Gilbert Ryle, Erwin R.J.A. Schr\u00f6dinger, Alan M. Turing,
      and others), the focus is on microbiology studies that are more\u2010recent,
      discussing these in the context of the scientific process and the types of scientific
      novelty that they represent. These include several studies carried out during
      the 2020 to 2022 lockdowns of the COVID\u201019 pandemic when access to research
      laboratories was disallowed (or limited). We interviewed the authors of some
      of the featured microbiology\u2010related papers and\u2014although we ourselves
      are involved in laboratory experiments and practical fieldwork\u2014also drew
      from our own research experiences showing that such studies can not only produce
      new scientific findings but can also transcend barriers between disciplines,
      act counter to scientific reductionism, integrate biological data across different
      timescales and levels of complexity, and circumvent constraints imposed by practical
      techniques. In relation to urgent research needs, we believe that climate change
      and other global challenges may require approaches beyond the experiment.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of machines
      that can mimic human intelligence. Machine learning is the subfield of artificial
      intelligence in which computers have the ability to learn and iteratively improve
      their performance without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning algorithms
      learn by processing the data with increasing levels of abstraction in each layer.
      We present a narrative review of the relevant literature with a particular focus
      on deep learning for image classification and image segmentation in neuroimaging.
      For the first time in history, computers can automatically perform some clinically
      relevant tasks at the level, or even above the level, of the relevant medical
      specialists. A turning point in machine learning occurred in the 2010s as a
      result of (1) the multiple technical improvements that machine learning has
      been accumulating over several decades, (2) the exponential increase in computing
      power, and (3) the wide availability of very large databases with millions of
      observations and thousands of variables. Machine learning is starting to be
      successfully applied to several areas of medicine, including predictive analytics,
      decision support, natural language processing of free\u2010text notes, and automatic
      interpretation of electrophysiological recordings. Among all the applications
      of machine learning in medicine, deep learning for computer vision is the one
      that has enjoyed the greatest success. The emphasis of this review is the application
      of convolutional neural networks for image classification and for image segmentation
      in neuroimaging. Machine learning and deep learning are increasingly integrated
      into the clinical workflow and applied in neuroimaging interpretation. Natural
      language processing is likely to gain increasing importance in medicine in the
      near future. Complex decision\u2010making that mimics human thinking with reinforcement

      The case of backchannel signaling", "abstract": "Understanding children''s conversational
      skills is crucial for understanding their social, cognitive, and linguistic
      development, with important applications in health and education. To develop
      theories based on quantitative studies of conversational development, we need
      (i) data recorded in naturalistic contexts (e.g., child-caregiver dyads talking
      in their daily environment) where children are more likely to show much of their
      conversational competencies, as opposed to controlled laboratory contexts which
      typically involve talking to a stranger (e.g., the experimenter); (ii) data
      that allows for clear access to children''s multimodal behavior in face-to-face
      conversations; and (iii) data whose acquisition method is cost-effective with
      the potential of being deployed at a large scale to capture individual and cultural
      variability. The current work is a first step to achieving this goal. We built
      a corpus of video chats involving children in middle childhood (6\u201312 years
      old) and their caregivers using a weakly structured word-guessing game to prompt
      spontaneous conversation. The manual annotations of these recordings have shown
      a similarity in the frequency distribution of multimodal communicative signals
      from both children and caregivers. As a case study, we capitalize on this rich
      behavioral data to study how verbal and non-verbal cues contribute to the children''s
      conversational coordination. In particular, we looked at how children learn
      to engage in coordinated conversations, not only as speakers but also as listeners,
      by analyzing children''s use of backchannel signaling (e.g., verbal \u201cmh\u201d
      or head nods) during these conversations. Contrary to results from previous
      in-lab studies, our use of a more spontaneous conversational setting (as well
      as more adequate controls) revealed that school-age children are strikingly
      close to adult-level mastery in many measures of backchanneling. Our work demonstrates
      the usefulness of recent technology in video calling for acquiring quality data
      that can be used for research on children''s conversational development in the
      wild.", "venue": "Frontiers of Computer Science", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      an explanation for observed patterns of genomic evolution. We propose to consider

      the automotive industry on the brink of a paradigm shift. Leveraging the ever-evolving
      technologies, vehicles are steadily transitioning towards automated driving
      to constitute an integral part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS).
      The term autonomous vehicle has become ubiquitous in our lives, owing to the
      extensive research and development that frequently make headlines. Nonetheless,
      the flourishing of AVs hinges on many factors due to the extremely stringent
      demands for safety, security, and reliability. Cutting-edge technologies play
      critical roles in tackling complicated issues. Assimilating trailblazing technologies
      such as the Internet of Things (IoT), edge intelligence (EI), 5G, and Blockchain
      into the AV architecture will unlock the potential of an efficient and sustainable
      transportation system. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art
      in the literature on the impact and implementation of the aforementioned technologies
      into AV architectures, along with the challenges faced by each of them. We also
      provide insights into the technological offshoots concerning their seamless
      integration to fulfill the requirements of AVs. Finally, the paper sheds light
      on future research directions and opportunities that will spur further developments.
      Exploring the integration of key enabling technologies in a single work will
      serve as a valuable reference for the community interested in the relevant issues
      surrounding AV research.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors",

      "title": "Reviewing Federated Machine Learning and Its Use in Diseases Prediction",
      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has succeeded in improving our daily routines
      by enabling automation and improved decision making in a variety of industries
      such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, resulting in increased efficiency
      and production. However, the development and widespread use of this technology
      has been significantly hampered by concerns about data privacy, confidentiality,
      and sensitivity, particularly in healthcare and finance. The \u201cdata hunger\u201d
      of ML describes how additional data can increase performance and accuracy, which
      is why this question arises. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a technology
      that helps solve the privacy problem by eliminating the need to send data to
      a primary server and collect it where it is processed and the model is trained.
      To maintain privacy and improve model performance, FL shares parameters rather
      than data during training, in contrast to the typical ML practice of sending
      user data during model development. Although FL is still in its infancy, there
      are already applications in various industries such as healthcare, finance,
      transportation, and others. In addition, 32% of companies have implemented or
      plan to implement federated learning in the next 12\u201324 months, according
      to the latest figures from KPMG, which forecasts an increase in investment in
      this area from USD 107 million in 2020 to USD 538 million in 2025. In this context,
      this article reviews federated learning, describes it technically, differentiates
      it from other technologies, and discusses current FL aggregation algorithms.
      It also discusses the use of FL in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease,
      diabetes, and cancer. Finally, the problems hindering progress in this area
      and future strategies to overcome these limitations are discussed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: This study was done to explore the utility of artificial
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning in the diagnosis and grouping of intraocular
      retinoblastoma (iRB). Methods: It was a retrospective observational study using
      AI and Machine learning, Computer Vision (OpenCV). Results: Of 771 fundus images
      of 109 eyes, 181 images had no tumor and 590 images displayed iRB based on review
      by two independent ocular oncologists (with an interobserver variability of
      <1%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
      predictive value of the trained AI model were 85%, 99%, 99.6%, and 67%, respectively.
      Of 109 eyes, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
      predictive value for detection of RB by AI model were 96%, 94%, 97%, and 91%,
      respectively. Of these, the eyes were normal (n = 31) or belonged to groupA
      (n=1), B (n=22), C (n=8), D (n=23),and E (n=24) RB based on review by two independent
      ocular oncologists (with an interobserver variability of 0%). The sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the
      trained AI model were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% for group A; 82%, 20 21 98%,

      and 94% for group D, and 92%, 91%, 73%, and 98% for group E, respectively. Conclusion:
      Based on our study, we conclude that the AI model for iRB is highly sensitive
      in the detection of RB with high specificity for the classification of iRB.",

      "This paper deals with an investigation centered on developing a real estate
      app on the basis of Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality technologies.
      The study explores the advantages and disadvantages of using Artificial Intelligence
      and Virtual Reality technologies in real estate. The main focus of the study
      was on AI/VR applications that have importance for the real estate industry.
      This paper explains how AI and VR technologies can benefit the real estate market.
      VR and AI technologies have had a long history in the academic world since the
      middle of the last century, but not at the same level, due to the lack of large
      amounts of data and computational power required for both technologies. In recent
      years, the expansion of IT technologies has helped to remove the technical obstacles,
      which is why the interest in VR and AI technologies has acutely increased in
      society and the public over the past several years. Not only the research and
      abstract ideas of the virtual world but also the feasibility of companies from
      different industries are becoming more and more relevant. In particular, when
      it comes to virtual reality, the focus is on 360\u00b0 images. With special
      cameras, the entire environment can be captured in a three-dimensional space
      and then cut together in such a way that the viewer can actually look around
      in this room and monitor events from his perspective. This opens the possibility
      of presenting different content in a completely new way. Technical shortcomings
      currently hamper the feeling of true immersion in virtual worlds. A detailed
      literature review provides the necessary theoretical basis for artificial intelligence
      and virtual reality with a particular emphasis on its use in the real estate
      industry.", "venue": "Electronics", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 52, "citationCount":

      Industrial Revolution\u2019", "abstract": "We are told by the powerful that
      we live in, or are about to live in, a Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Seemingly,
      this revolution is about deep-seated, rapid, digitally powered techno-scientific
      change. It is the age of smart machines; it is a new information technology
      (IT) revolution. However, in this article I suggest that examination of the
      history of technologies that are often held up to be proof of the 4IR, in fact
      shows that there is no contemporary technological revolution. The research methodology
      that I employ here is conceptual analysis and a focused review of literature
      on the history of particular technologies. An industrial revolution, as its
      three historical instances have demonstrated, is the fundamental transformation
      of every aspect of industrial society, including its geopolitical, cultural,
      macro-social, micro-social, economic and technological strata. It certainly
      entails a technological revolution, but it is more than just that. In this article,
      I am not concerned with the broader ensemble of socio-economic changes \u2013
      it seems increasingly clear that the \u2018brave new world\u2019 of the 4IR
      is not really happening \u2013 but simply ask the question: is there currently
      a technological revolution? The answer seems to be that there is not.\nSignificance:\nThe
      significance of this study is that it challenges the mainstream notion of technological
      innovation and change, associated with the \u2018Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019.
      It has implications for the way we think about technological and scientific
      revolutions.", "venue": "South African Journal of Science", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      it is a tedious task for the machine to learn what a human is capable of. The
      model must be built in a way such that when it reads the scene, it recognizes

      must be semantically and syntactically accurate. Hence, availability of Artificial

      attention in both academic and industrial communities. ChatGPT is able to respond
      effectively to a wide range of human questions, providing fluent and comprehensive
      answers that significantly surpass previous public chatbots in terms of security
      and usefulness. On one hand, people are curious about how ChatGPT is able to
      achieve such strength and how far it is from human experts. On the other hand,
      people are starting to worry about the potential negative impacts that large
      language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could have on society, such as fake news,
      plagiarism, and social security issues. In this work, we collected tens of thousands
      of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with questions
      ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and psychological areas.
      We call the collected dataset the Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3). Based
      on the HC3 dataset, we study the characteristics of ChatGPT''s responses, the
      differences and gaps from human experts, and future directions for LLMs. We
      conducted comprehensive human evaluations and linguistic analyses of ChatGPT-generated
      content compared with that of humans, where many interesting results are revealed.
      After that, we conduct extensive experiments on how to effectively detect whether
      a certain text is generated by ChatGPT or humans. We build three different detection
      systems, explore several key factors that influence their effectiveness, and
      evaluate them in different scenarios. The dataset, code, and models are all

      perspective", "abstract": "Today''s large language models (LLMs) routinely generate
      coherent, grammatical and seemingly meaningful paragraphs of text. This achievement
      has led to speculation that these networks are -- or will soon become --\"thinking
      machines\", capable of performing tasks that require abstract knowledge and
      reasoning. Here, we review the capabilities of LLMs by considering their performance
      on two different aspects of language use: ''formal linguistic competence'',
      which includes knowledge of rules and patterns of a given language, and ''functional
      linguistic competence'', a host of cognitive abilities required for language
      understanding and use in the real world. Drawing on evidence from cognitive
      neuroscience, we show that formal competence in humans relies on specialized
      language processing mechanisms, whereas functional competence recruits multiple
      extralinguistic capacities that comprise human thought, such as formal reasoning,
      world knowledge, situation modeling, and social cognition. In line with this
      distinction, LLMs show impressive (although imperfect) performance on tasks
      requiring formal linguistic competence, but fail on many tests requiring functional
      competence. Based on this evidence, we argue that (1) contemporary LLMs should
      be taken seriously as models of formal linguistic skills; (2) models that master
      real-life language use would need to incorporate or develop not only a core
      language module, but also multiple non-language-specific cognitive capacities
      required for modeling thought. Overall, a distinction between formal and functional
      linguistic competence helps clarify the discourse surrounding LLMs'' potential
      and provides a path toward building models that understand and use language
      in human-like ways.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      "The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to be rapid, making it
      an essential part of information technology. As a result, IoT devices must be
      able to handle data collection, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, and
      preprocessing of data, while also considering cost, processing power, and energy
      consumption. This paper introduces a system for device indoor localization that
      uses variations in the strength of the wireless signal. The proposed system
      addresses logistics use cases in which it is imperative to achieve reliable
      end-to-end delivery, such as pharmaceutic delivery, delivery of confidential
      documents and court exhibits, and even food, since the same is introduced into
      human organism and presents a potential risk of terrorist or other attack. This
      work proposes a concept based on low-power and low-cost LoRaWAN based system
      that utilizes a Machine Learning technique based on Neural Networks to achieve
      high accuracy in device indoor localization by measuring the signal strength
      of a beacon device. Furthermore, using signal strength measurements, that is,
      RSSI and SNR captured by LoRaWAN gateways, it is possible to estimate the location
      of the device point with an accuracy of up to 98.8%.", "venue": "Electronics",

      posthumously published manuscripts were dedicated to the development of his
      theory of organic pattern formation. In \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d
      (1952), he provided an elaborated mathematical formulation of the theory of
      the origins of biological form that had been first proposed by Sir D\u2019Arcy
      Wendworth Thompson in On Growth and Form (1917/1942). While arguably his most
      mathematically detailed and his systematically most ambitious effort, Turing\u2019s
      morphogenetical writings also form the most thematically self-contained and
      least philosophically explored part of his work. We dedicate our inquiry to
      the reasons and the implications of Turing\u2019s choice of biological topic
      and viewpoint. We will probe for possible factors in Turing\u2019s choice that
      go beyond availability and acquaintance with On Growth and Form. On these grounds,
      we will explore how and to what extent his theory of morphogenesis actually
      ties in with his concept of mechanistic computation. Notably, Thompson\u2019s
      pioneering work in biological \u2018structuralism\u2019 was organicist in outlook
      and explicitly critical of the Darwinian approaches that were popular with Turing\u2019s
      cyberneticist contemporaries\u2014and partly used by Turing himself in his proto-connectionist
      models of learning. Resolving this apparent dichotomy, we demonstrate how Turing\u2019s
      quest for mechanistic explanations of how organisation emerges in nature leaves
      room for a non-mechanist view of nature.", "venue": "Philosophies", "year":

      As first identified by Turing, all authors in this Special Issue recognize semantics
      as a crucial concern in the brain-computer analogy debate, and consequently
      address a number of such issues. What is missing, we believe, is the distinction
      between metaphor and analogy, which we reevaluate, describe in some detail,
      and offer a definition for the latter. To enrich the debate, we also deem necessary
      to develop on the evolutionary theories of the brain, of which we provide an
      overview. This article closes with thoughts on creativity in Science, for we
      concur with the stance that metaphors and analogies, and their esthetic impact,
      are essential to the creative process, be it in Sciences as well as in Arts.",

      "An investigation of the concept of \u201csurveyability\u201d as traced through
      the thought of Hilbert, Wittgenstein, and Turing. The communicability and reproducibility
      of proof, with certainty, are seen as earmarked by the \u201csurveyability\u201d
      of symbols, sequences, and structures of proof in all these thinkers. Hilbert
      initiated the idea within his metamathematics, Wittgenstein took up a kind of
      game formalism in the 1920s and early 1930s in response. Turing carried Hilbert\u2019s
      conception of the \u201csurveyability\u201d of proof in metamathematics through
      into his analysis of what a formal system (what a step in a computation) is
      in \u201cOn computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem\u201d
      (1936). Wittgenstein\u2019s 1939 investigations of the significance of surveyability
      to the concept of \u201cproof \u201cin Principia Mathematica were influenced,
      both by Turing\u2019s remarkable everyday analysis of the Hilbertian idea, and
      by conversations with Turing. Although Turing does not use the word \u201csurveyability\u201d
      explicitly, it is clear that the Hilbertian idea plays a recurrent role in his
      work, refracted through his engagement with Wittgenstein\u2019s idea of a \u201clanguage-game\u201d.
      This is evinced in some of his later writings, where the \u201creform\u201d
      of mathematical notation for the sake of human surveyability (1944/45) may be
      seen to draw out the Hilbertian idea. For Turing, as for Wittgenstein, the need
      for \u201csurveyability\u201d earmarks the evolving culture of humans located
      in an evolving social and scientific world, just as it had for Hilbert.", "venue":

      "abstract": "Residual Bouguer gravity anomaly inversion can be used to imaging
      for local density structures or to interpret near-surface anomalous mass distribution.
      The reasonable prior information is the crucial recipe for obtaining a realistic
      geological inversion result, especially for the ill-posed geophysical inversion
      problem. The conventional strategies introduce the prior constraints or joint
      multidisciplinary information in object function as regularization, and then
      use some optimization algorithm to minimize the object function. This process
      is called model-driven approach and is usually time-consuming. In recent years,
      the rapid development of machine learning technology has provided new solutions
      for solving geophysical inversion problems. Machine learning methods can reduce
      the dependence on prior information in the inversion process through setting
      special training datasets, and the time consumption of an inversion process
      executed by the trained model can be shortened by several orders of magnitude,
      which is conducive to fast inversion for the same type of application scenarios.
      In this study, we were inspired by the U-net model and develops the GV-Net (Gravity
      voxels inversion network) model using the convolutional neural network for the
      inversion of residual gravity anomalies. We first discussed the effects of different
      loss functions on the convergence speed of model training and prediction accuracy.
      Then, we analyzed the robustness of our model by changing noise levels of the
      datasets. At last, we employed this model in a real scenario. The results have
      demonstrated that the GV-Net model has the ability to deal with specific inverse
      problems by predefined training datasets.", "venue": "Frontiers in Earth Science",

      "title": "A Protocol for Intelligible Interaction Between Agents That Learn
      and Explain", "abstract": "Recent engineering developments have seen the emergence
      of Machine Learning (ML) as a powerful form of data analysis with widespread
      applicability beyond its historical roots in the design of autonomous agents.
      However, relatively little attention has been paid to the interaction between
      people and ML systems. Recent developments on Explainable ML address this by
      providing visual and textual information on how the ML system arrived at a conclusion.
      In this paper we view the interaction between humans and ML systems within the
      broader context of interaction between agents capable of learning and explanation.
      Within this setting, we argue that it is more helpful to view the interaction
      as characterised by two-way intelligibility of information rather than once-off
      explanation of a prediction. We formulate two-way intelligibility as a property
      of a communication protocol. Development of the protocol is motivated by a set
      of `Intelligibility Axioms'' for decision-support systems that use ML with a
      human-in-the-loop. The axioms are intended as sufficient criteria to claim that:
      (a) information provided by a human is intelligible to an ML system; and (b)
      information provided by an ML system is intelligible to a human. The axioms
      inform the design of a general synchronous interaction model between agents
      capable of learning and explanation. We identify conditions of compatibility
      between agents that result in bounded communication, and define Weak and Strong
      Two-Way Intelligibility between agents as properties of the communication protocol.",

      Literature Review", "abstract": "Background: The advancement of information
      and communication technologies and the growing power of artificial intelligence
      are successfully transforming a number of concepts that are important to our
      daily lives. Many sectors, including education, healthcare, industry, and others,
      are benefiting greatly from the use of such resources. The healthcare sector,
      for example, was an early adopter of smart wearables, which primarily serve
      as diagnostic tools. In this context, smart wearables have demonstrated their
      effectiveness in detecting and predicting cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the
      leading cause of death worldwide. Objective: In this study, a systematic literature
      review of smart wearable applications for cardiovascular disease detection and
      prediction is presented. After conducting the required search, the documents
      that met the criteria were analyzed to extract key criteria such as the publication
      year, vital signs recorded, diseases studied, hardware used, smart models used,
      datasets used, and performance metrics. Methods: This study followed the PRISMA
      guidelines by searching IEEE, PubMed, and Scopus for publications published
      between 2010 and 2022. Once records were located, they were reviewed to determine
      which ones should be included in the analysis. Finally, the analysis was completed,
      and the relevant data were included in the review along with the relevant articles.
      Results: As a result of the comprehensive search procedures, 87 papers were
      deemed relevant for further review. In addition, the results are discussed to
      evaluate the development and use of smart wearable devices for cardiovascular
      disease management, and the results demonstrate the high efficiency of such
      wearable devices. Conclusions: The results clearly show that interest in this
      topic has increased. Although the results show that smart wearables are quite
      accurate in detecting, predicting, and even treating cardiovascular disease,
      further research is needed to improve their use.", "venue": "Italian National

      in different meanings in different fields of study and daily life, causing misunderstanding
      and confusion. There is a need to clarify what information is and how it relates
      to knowledge. It is argued that information is meaning represented by physical
      symbols such as sights, sounds, and words. Knowledge is meaning that resides
      in a conscious mind. The basic building blocks of information are symbols and
      meaning, which cannot be reduced to one another. The symbols of information
      are the physical media of representation and the means of transmission of information.
      Without the associated meaning, the symbols of information have no significance
      since meaning is an ascribed and acquired quality and not an inherent property
      of the symbols. We can transmit symbols of information but cannot transmit meaning
      from one mind to another without a common protocol or convention. A concise
      and cohesive framework for information can be established on the common ground
      of the mind, meaning, and symbols trio. Using reasoned arguments, logical consistency,
      and conformity with common experiences and observations as the methodology,
      this paper offers valuable insights to facilitate clear understanding and unifies
      several definitions of information into one in a cohesive manner.", "venue":

      the binary between craft and code that animates the volume as a whole. This

      rationality, industrialization, and empire. It was subsequently adopted by historians,
      philosophers, and sociologists of science, becoming a key ingredient in the

      \u201clearning\u201d cross-fertilized with work in early artificial intelligence,
      such that notions of craft and code helped structure the development of algorithmic
      culture itself. Subsequent machine learning practices further complicated this
      relationship. Human/AI assemblages can no longer be comprehended in terms of
      a binary that may have been appropriate for earlier conceptions of human reasoning

      like multitenancy, Insecure interfaces/APIs, Malicious Insiders, Malware injections,
      the lack of information on location of storage of data, the unavailability of
      details on type of data saved in the same server, hacking. AI or Artificial
      Intelligence works on pre-collected data and scenarios fed into the computers
      thereby predicting in advance the possibilities of risk, warning if there is
      any unusual occurrence in the cloud and proposing the Risk Mitigation plans
      based on various scenarios. Proactive risk prediction will have a huge impact
      on risk mitigation, cost saving as well as customer satisfaction. A pilot study
      has been conducted to ascertain the impact of various risk factors identified
      by circulating the questionnaire among practitioners from the relevant domains.
      The questionnaire is circulated among the current industry practitioners and
      experts in this area and facilitates to conduct the pilot survey on the significance
      of various risk parameter. The impact of each risk factor is identified and
      is subjected to analysis. With the help of prediction algorithms, the possibility
      of occurrence of risk, the impact, and consequences of that particular event,
      as well as the mitigation strategies could be foretold. This objective of this
      paper is to propose management perspective of a framework of AI, that can contribute
      to proactive risk management in cloud. This paper deals only with the management
      overview of implementation of AI in risk mitigation strategies and not the technical
      aspects of AI. The futuristic scope of this paper would be a management overview
      on automation of risk mitigation strategies in cloud platform using AI.", "venue":

      to the quality control of digitization workflows, and to the exploitation of
      historical document collections, by demonstrating the utility of serendipitous
      exploration (as opposed to targeted searches) through the use of Document Towers,
      a visual representation of the physical structure of documents as architectural
      models. The Document Towers are evaluated via a qualitative case study on historical
      Swiss newspapers, a thought experiment comparing them to alternative solutions,
      a diagrammatic visual and numeric assessment of exploratory tasks, and several
      quantitative and empirical usability measurements and psychometric surveys.
      The experiments confirmed that both serendipitous exploration and the Document
      Towers visualization are objectively well-suited for the quality control and
      exploration of digital documents. A significant disparity in subjective usability
      was observed between librarians and academics, who rated the visualization concept
      below and above average, respectively. Other findings included the redefinition
      of quality control as a tool of knowledge and dialogue among stakeholders in
      information systems; a generic diagrammatic instrument for evaluating the outcomes
      of explorations; demonstrating how the adoption of novel information technology

      "title": "Artificial anatomy", "abstract": "What happens if a robot passes the
      Turing test (the test of a robot''s ability to replicate intelligent human behavior
      [Turing, 1950])? Which behaviors or actions would they be capable of performing
      with each other and/or with human beings? How would knowing that a percentage
      of those with whom we relate are not entirely flesh and blood modify our own
      conduct and behavior? Director Ridley Scott''s seminal and excellent film \u201cBlade
      Runner\u201d (Warner Bros, 1982) introduced a whole generation to the details
      of how to appear human while being a robot. In the film, the bladerunners had
      to detect, capture, or annihilate robots whose bodies and minds were virtually
      indistinguishable from our own. To do so, they put subjects through a test that
      essentially recapitulated the Turing test. It consisted of asking questions
      whose answers would allow us to distinguish whether the answerer is human or
      robot. The screenplay, based on the Philip K. Dick''s short tale, \u201cDo androids
      dream of electric sheep?\u201d (Dick, 1968), puts in the hands of the main character,
      Rick Deckard, the responsibility that the most advanced versions of androids
      not escape search and capture, and therefore, not pass the Turing test. Somewhere
      in the background is the concept that there will be at least some human emotions
      or behaviors that a robot will never be able to fake well enough to fool a human.
      Although the above questions are very relevant, with a huge and constantly evolving
      philosophical component, they are difficult to tackle. There are, however, two
      aspects that can go unnoticed in this field. The first is the most difficult:
      the meta-problem of how an android would \u201cfeel\u201d this problem. Although
      that problem is out of the scope of this volume, we will deal with a variant
      of it in the next few paragraphs. The second aspect is already contained in
      Dick''s own original story and is masterfully represented in Blade Runner. In
      both works, it is assumed that artificial bodies will be totally indistinguishable
      from human bodies, both in form and in physiology. Artificial bodies could even
      be better, without it being an apparent problem for humans or, of course, for
      robots. Thus, while artificial intelligence (AI) advances month after month
      toward an unstoppable universe in which programs will reach ever closer to the
      frontier of passing the Turing test, it seems that the frontier of ensuring
      that bodies can be equipped with artificial anatomical elements that mimic human
      anatomy and physiology proceeds very differently, both in speed and conceptually.
      The scientific fields to which we refer are neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.
      We understand neurorobotics as the set of artificial systems designed to imitate
      the computational models of living neural networks, including their algorithms.
      Neuroprosthetics is the engineering discipline devoted to making possible the
      relationship between such algorithms and the physical devices that will execute
      the movements. Thus, the operability arising from the combination of artificial
      movement systems similar to humans, with the algorithms and neural network models
      that control them, primarily seeks to generate (increase or replace) the movement
      functionality of human beings. Such a frontier advances more slowly than AI,
      on the one hand, because a qualitatively and quantitatively different investment
      is being allocated in each race. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the
      question of how the subject \u201cfeels\u201d the new functionality is now a
      not insignificant but philosophically irrelevant problem, because the subject
      is \u201cmentally\u201d the same human being (and not an android foreign to
      our humanity). Still more relevant is the fact that the artificial anatomy and
      functionality of the device do NOT currently need to be indistinguishable from
      humans. There is nothing wrong with perceiving, both the subject and the environment
      around him/her, that someone has a bionic hand, arm, or leg. Or that one walks
      (or even runs) thanks to an exoskeleton that is beautiful or cumbersome to varying
      degrees (read, for example, Tan et al., 2021). The application of neurorobotics
      and neuroprosthetics after diseases or accidents will allow future restoration
      of brain function and limbs that today have no repair or treatment (see for
      example Masteller et al., 2021; Micera et al., 2020, or Kansaku, 2021). Received:

      It is proven that DT fuels Digital Innovation in organisations. It is well-known
      that technologies and practices such as distributed ledger technologies, open
      source, analytics, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) enhance DT. Among
      those technologies, AI provides tools to support decision-making and automatically
      decide. Cooperatives are organisations with a mutualistic scope and are characterised
      by having participatory cooperative governance due to the principle of democratic
      control by the members. In a context where DT is here to stay, where the dematerialisation
      of processes can bring significant advantages to any organisation, this article
      presents a critical reflection on the dangers of using AI technologies in cooperatives.
      We base this reflection on the Portuguese cooperative code. We emphasise that
      this code is not very different from the ones of other countries worldwide as
      they are all based on the Statement of Cooperative Identity defined by the International
      Cooperative Alliance. We understand that we cannot stop the entry of AI technologies
      into the cooperatives. Therefore, we present a framework for using AI technologies

      Cancer Markers Discovery", "abstract": "In conjunction with imaging analysis,
      pathology-based assessments of biopsied tissue are the gold standard for diagnosing
      solid tumors. However, the disadvantages of tissue biopsies, such as being invasive,
      time-consuming, and labor-intensive, have urged the development of an alternate
      method, liquid biopsy, that involves sampling and clinical assessment of various
      bodily fluids for cancer diagnosis. Meanwhile, extracellular vesicles (EVs)
      are circulating biomarkers that carry molecular profiles of their cell or tissue
      origins and have emerged as one of the most promising biomarkers for cancer.
      Owing to the biological information that can be obtained through EVs\u2019 membrane
      surface markers and their cargo loaded with biomolecules such as nucleic acids,
      proteins, and lipids, EVs have become useful in cancer diagnosis and therapeutic
      applications. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) allows rapid, non-destructive,
      label-free molecular profiling of EVs with minimal sample preparation. Since
      the heterogeneity of EV subpopulations may result in complicated FTIR spectra
      that are highly diverse, computational-assisted FTIR spectroscopy is employed
      in many studies to provide fingerprint spectra of malignant and non-malignant
      samples, allowing classification with high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.
      In view of this, FTIR-EV approach carries a great potential in cancer detection.
      The progression of FTIR-based biomarker identification in EV research, the rationale
      of the integration of a computationally assisted approach, along with the challenges
      of clinical translation are the focus of this review.", "venue": "Diagnostics",

      "Along with the springing up of the semantics-empowered communication (SemCom)
      research, it is now witnessing an unprecedentedly growing interest towards a
      wide range of aspects (e.g., theories, applications, metrics and implementations)
      in both academia and industry. In this work, we primarily aim to provide a comprehensive
      survey on both the background and research taxonomy, as well as a detailed technical
      tutorial. Specifically, we start by reviewing the literature and answering the\"what\"and\"why\"questions
      in semantic transmissions. Afterwards, we present the ecosystems of SemCom,
      including history, theories, metrics, datasets and toolkits, on top of which
      the taxonomy for research directions is presented. Furthermore, we propose to
      categorize the critical enabling techniques by explicit and implicit reasoning-based
      methods, and elaborate on how they evolve and contribute to modern content&channel
      semantics-empowered communications. Besides reviewing and summarizing the latest
      efforts in SemCom, we discuss the relations with other communication levels
      (e.g., conventional communications) from a holistic and unified viewpoint. Subsequently,
      in order to facilitate future developments and industrial applications, we also
      highlight advanced practical techniques for boosting semantic accuracy, robustness,
      and large-scale scalability, just to mention a few. Finally, we discuss the

      "title": "Benchmarking of Machine Learning Ocean Subgrid Parameterizations in
      an Idealized Model", "abstract": "Recently, a growing number of studies have
      used machine learning (ML) models to parameterize computationally intensive
      subgrid\u2010scale processes in ocean models. Such studies typically train ML
      models with filtered and coarse\u2010grained high\u2010resolution data and evaluate
      their predictive performance offline, before implementing them in a coarse resolution
      model and assessing their online performance. In this work, we systematically
      benchmark the online performance of such models, their generalization to domains
      not encountered during training, and their sensitivity to data set design choices.
      We apply this proposed framework to compare a large number of physical and neural
      network (NN)\u2010based parameterizations. We find that the choice of filtering
      and coarse\u2010graining operator is particularly critical and this choice should
      be guided by the application. We also show that all of our physics\u2010constrained
      NNs are stable and perform well when implemented online, but generalize poorly
      to new regimes. To improve generalization and also interpretability, we propose
      a novel equation\u2010discovery approach combining linear regression and genetic
      programming with spatial derivatives. We find this approach performs on par
      with neural networks on the training domain but generalizes better beyond it.
      We release code and data to reproduce our results and provide the research community
      with easy\u2010to\u2010use resources to develop and evaluate additional parameterizations.",

      "title": "Human Digital Twin: A Survey", "abstract": "Digital twin has recently
      attracted growing attention, leading to intensive research and applications.
      Along with this, a new research area, dubbed as\"human digital twin\"(HDT),
      has emerged. Similar to the conception of digital twin, HDT is referred to as
      the replica of a physical-world human in the digital world. Nevertheless, HDT
      is much more complicated and delicate compared to digital twins of any physical
      systems and processes, due to humans'' dynamic and evolutionary nature, including
      physical, behavioral, social, physiological, psychological, cognitive, and biological
      dimensions. Studies on HDT are limited, and the research is still in its infancy.
      In this paper, we first examine the inception, development, and application
      of the digital twin concept, providing a context within which we formally define
      and characterize HDT based on the similarities and differences between digital
      twin and HDT. Then we conduct an extensive literature review on HDT research,
      analyzing underpinning technologies and establishing typical frameworks in which
      the core HDT functions or components are organized. Built upon the findings
      from the above work, we propose a generic architecture for the HDT system and
      describe the core function blocks and corresponding technologies. Following
      this, we present the state of the art of HDT technologies and applications in
      the healthcare, industry, and daily life domain. Finally, we discuss various
      issues related to the development of HDT and point out the trends and challenges
      of future HDT research and development.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022,

      Two task challenges- summary and question answering- prompt ChatGPT to produce

      initially posed by Turing in 1950. We score the original and generated content
      against the OpenAI GPT2 Output Detector from 2019, and establish multiple cases
      where the generated content proves original and undetectable (98%). The question
      of a machine fooling a human judge recedes in this work relative to the question

      a metric and simple grammatical set for understanding the writing mechanics
      of chatbots in evaluating their readability and statistical clarity, engagement,
      delivery, overall quality, and plagiarism risks. While Turing''s original prose
      scores at least 14% below the machine-generated output, whether an algorithm

      is proposed to clarify the scope of individual contributions, grounded in their
      commitments to human-like behaviour, neural plausibility or benchmark/engineering/computer

      human-like agents, and discussing the generative, corroborate and corrective

      test in automated driving with affective transition modelling", "abstract":
      "Autonomous cars are indispensable when humans go further down the hands-free
      route. Although existing literature highlights that the acceptance of the autonomous
      car will increase if it drives in a human-like manner, sparse research offers
      the naturalistic experience from a passenger''s seat perspective to examine
      the humanness of current autonomous cars. The present study tested whether the
      AI driver could create a human-like ride experience for passengers based on
      69 participants'' feedback in a real-road scenario. We designed a ride experience-based
      version of the non-verbal Turing test for automated driving. Participants rode
      in autonomous cars (driven by either human or AI drivers) as a passenger and
      judged whether the driver was human or AI. The AI driver failed to pass our
      test because passengers detected the AI driver above chance. In contrast, when
      the human driver drove the car, the passengers'' judgement was around chance.
      We further investigated how human passengers ascribe humanness in our test.
      Based on Lewin''s field theory, we advanced a computational model combining
      signal detection theory with pre-trained language models to predict passengers''
      humanness rating behaviour. We employed affective transition between pre-study
      baseline emotions and corresponding post-stage emotions as the signal strength
      of our model. Results showed that the passengers'' ascription of humanness would
      increase with the greater affective transition. Our study suggested an important
      role of affective transition in passengers'' ascription of humanness, which
      might become a future direction for autonomous driving.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions

      "Any organization needs to improve their products, services, and processes.
      In this context, engaging with customers and understanding their journey is
      essential. Organizations have leveraged various techniques and technologies
      to support customer engagement, from call centres to chatbots and virtual agents.
      Recently, these systems have used Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language
      Processing (NLP) to analyze large volumes of customer feedback and engagement
      data. The goal is to understand customers in context and provide meaningful
      answers across various channels. Despite multiple advances in Conversational
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Recommender Systems (RS), it is still challenging
      to understand the intent behind customer questions during the customer journey.
      To address this challenge, in this paper, we study and analyze the recent work
      in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) in general and, more specifically,
      in chatbot-based CRS. We introduce a pipeline to contextualize the input utterances
      in conversations. We then take the next step towards leveraging reverse feature
      engineering to link the contextualized input and learning model to support intent
      recognition. Since performance evaluation is achieved based on different ML
      models, we use transformer base models to evaluate the proposed approach using
      a labelled dialogue dataset (MSDialogue) of question-answering interactions
      between information seekers and answer providers.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

      indispensable in a humanized ambience intelligence environment. NLP facilitates
      ambient intelligence by making machines understand, and be understood by, humans.
      This in turn makes machines behave more human-like than they typically are today.
      Technological advances in machine learning (ML), and especially deep learning
      (DL), have been a key enabler of NLP research. This paper begins with a survey
      of recent developments of ML/DL for NLP. It then identifies some of the most
      promising techniques reported in recent literature. These most promising techniques
      are then assembled into a reusable toolkit for computational NLP. The adaptable
      nature of the assembled toolkit allows it to be reused in a broad range of NLP
      applications. The paper then describes experimental evaluation of our implemented
      solutions for comparative analysis. Two specific NLP applications form the basis
      of comparative evaluation. The first involves identifying one of M English sentences
      that does not make sense. The second, which is harder than the first, involves
      choosing from among N sentences the one that best explains why a presented sentence
      is invalid. Human baseline accuracies for these applications are 99.1% and 97.8%,
      respectively. The observation that these results are somewhat less than perfect
      demonstrates that even humans can occasionally find these tasks difficult. It
      further underscores the difficulties involved in some of these computational

      and Multimodal Perception", "abstract": "With state-of-the-art models achieving
      high performance on standard benchmarks, contemporary research paradigms continue
      to emphasize general intelligence as an enduring objective. However, this pursuit
      overlooks the fundamental disparities between the high-level data perception
      abilities of artificial and natural intelligence systems. This study questions
      the Turing Test as a criterion of generally intelligent thought and contends
      that it is misinterpreted as an attempt to anthropomorphize computer systems.
      Instead, it emphasizes tacit learning as a cornerstone of general-purpose intelligence,
      despite its lack of overt interpretability. This abstract form of intelligence
      necessitates contextual cognitive attributes that are crucial for human-level
      perception: generalizable experience, moral responsibility, and implicit prioritization.
      The absence of these features yields undeniable perceptual disparities and constrains
      the cognitive capacity of artificial systems to effectively contextualize their
      environments. Additionally, this study establishes that, despite extensive exploration
      of potential architecture for future systems, little consideration has been
      given to how such models will continuously absorb and adapt to contextual data.
      While conventional models may continue to improve in benchmark performance,
      disregarding these contextual considerations will lead to stagnation in human-like
      comprehension. Until general intelligence can be abstracted from task-specific
      domains and systems can learn implicitly from their environments, research standards
      should instead prioritize the disciplines in which AI thrives.", "venue": "",

      "abstract": "Abstract The rapid increases of the global population and climate
      change pose major challenges to a sustainable production of food to meet consumer
      demands. Process-based models (PBMs) have long been used in agricultural crop
      production for predicting yield and understanding the environmental regulation
      of plant physiological processes and its consequences for crop growth and development.
      In recent years, with the increasing use of sensor and communication technologies
      for data acquisition in agriculture, machine learning (ML) has become a popular
      tool in yield prediction (especially on a large scale) and phenotyping. Both
      PBMs and ML are frequently used in studies on major challenges in crop production
      and each has its own advantages and drawbacks. We propose to combine PBMs and
      ML given their intrinsic complementarity, to develop knowledge- and data-driven
      modelling (KDDM) with high prediction accuracy as well as good interpretability.
      Parallel, serial and modular structures are three main modes can be adopted
      to develop KDDM for agricultural applications. The KDDM approach helps to simplify
      model parameterization by making use of sensor data and improves the accuracy
      of yield prediction. Furthermore, the KDDM approach has great potential to expand
      the boundary of current crop models to allow upscaling towards a farm, regional
      or global level and downscaling to the gene-to-cell level. The KDDM approach
      is a promising way of combining simulation models in agriculture with the fast
      developments in data science while mechanisms of many genetic and physiological
      processes are still under investigation, especially at the nexus of increasing
      food production, mitigating climate change and achieving sustainability.", "venue":

      a decision support system for disaster management using serious games to collect
      experts\u2019 judgments on its performance. PREDIS is a model for DISaster response
      supplier selection (PREDIS). It has a PREDictive component (PRED) for predicting
      the disaster human impact and an estimation component to Estimate the DISaster
      (EDIS) needs to optimise supplier-based resource allocation. A quasi-experiment
      design embedded in a participatory simulation game is conducted to compare the
      opinions of equal samples of 22 experts and non-experts. The following questions
      are put forward. First, \u201cDoes PREDIS model assists the decision makers
      to make the same decisions faster?\u201d Second, \u201cDoes the PREDIS model
      assist the non-experts as simulated decision makers to decide like an expert?\u201d
      Using AHP weights of decision makers\u2019 preferences as well as Borda counts,
      the decisions are compared. The result shows that PREDIS helps to reduce the
      decision-making time by experts and non-experts to 6 h after the disaster strike,
      instead of the usual 72 h. It also assists 71% of the non-experts to make decisions
      similar to those made by experts. In summary, the PREDIS model has two major
      capabilities. It enables the experts and non-experts to predict the disaster
      results immediately using widely available data. It also enables the non-experts
      to decide almost the same as the experts; either in predicting the human impact
      of a disaster and estimating the needs or in selecting suitable suppliers.",

      Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most striking recent technology developments.
      Potentially, it can significantly affect all areas of economic activities including
      agriculture. The paper addresses two issues such as the actual essence of AI
      and its most important current and expected future applications in agriculture
      and their potential impact on labor use and productivity of this sector. The
      research methods applied in the paper are critical analysis of selected literature
      sources and deductive reasoning regarding the likely influence of ai applications
      on labor use in agriculture and its total factor productivity. It was found
      out that applications of AI in agriculture are numerous and very diverse both
      in terms of technological solutions and managed processes. Moreover, the market
      for AI applications in agriculture is expected to grow quite rapidly due to
      an increasing tendency to automatize agricultural production and marketing processes.
      This inevitably leads to substitution of physical labor with sophisticated machinery
      and robots. Also, it generates demand for new labor competencies needed to manage
      increasingly capital intensive agricultural production and related processes
      driven by the use of AI. Based on mainly theoretical considerations, it can
      be surmised that widespread use of ai in agriculture should positively contribute
      to the growth in the total factor productivity (TFP) of the sector. Consequently,
      countries where agricultural producers adopt AI solutions faster can gain competitive
      advantage in food production.", "venue": "Zagadnienia Ekonomiki Rolnej / Problems

      "Abstract Deep neural networks (DNNs) have had extraordinary successes in classifying
      photographic images of objects and are often described as the best models of
      biological vision. This conclusion is largely based on three sets of findings:
      (1) DNNs are more accurate than any other model in classifying images taken
      from various datasets, (2) DNNs do the best job in predicting the pattern of
      human errors in classifying objects taken from various behavioral datasets,
      and (3) DNNs do the best job in predicting brain signals in response to images
      taken from various brain datasets (e.g., single cell responses or fMRI data).
      However, these behavioral and brain datasets do not test hypotheses regarding
      what features are contributing to good predictions and we show that the predictions
      may be mediated by DNNs that share little overlap with biological vision. More
      problematically, we show that DNNs account for almost no results from psychological
      research. This contradicts the common claim that DNNs are good, let alone the
      best, models of human object recognition. We argue that theorists interested
      in developing biologically plausible models of human vision need to direct their
      attention to explaining psychological findings. More generally, theorists need
      to build models that explain the results of experiments that manipulate independent
      variables designed to test hypotheses rather than compete on making the best
      predictions. We conclude by briefly summarizing various promising modeling approaches
      that focus on psychological data.", "venue": "Behavioral and Brain Sciences",

      "title": "LSD-induced increase of Ising temperature and algorithmic complexity
      of brain dynamics", "abstract": "A topic of growing interest in computational
      neuroscience is the discovery of fundamental principles underlying global dynamics
      and the self-organization of the brain. In particular, the notion that the brain
      operates near criticality has gained considerable support, and recent work has
      shown that the dynamics of different brain states may be modeled by pairwise
      maximum entropy Ising models at various distances from a phase transition, i.e.,
      from criticality. Here we aim to characterize two brain states (psychedelics-induced
      and placebo) as captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with
      features derived from the Ising spin model formalism (system temperature, critical
      point, susceptibility) and from algorithmic complexity. We hypothesized, along
      the lines of the entropic brain hypothesis, that psychedelics drive brain dynamics
      into a more disordered state at a higher Ising temperature and increased complexity.
      We analyze resting state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data collected
      in an earlier study from fifteen subjects in a control condition (placebo) and
      during ingestion of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Working with the automated
      anatomical labeling (AAL) brain parcellation, we first create \u201carchetype\u201d
      Ising models representative of the entire dataset (global) and of the data in
      each condition. Remarkably, we find that such archetypes exhibit a strong correlation
      with an average structural connectome template obtained from dMRI (r = 0.6).
      We compare the archetypes from the two conditions and find that the Ising connectivity
      in the LSD condition is lower than the placebo one, especially at homotopic
      links (interhemispheric connectivity), reflecting a significant decrease of
      homotopic functional connectivity in the LSD condition. The global archetype
      is then personalized for each individual and condition by adjusting the system
      temperature. The resulting temperatures are all near but above the critical
      point of the model in the paramagnetic (disordered) phase. The individualized
      Ising temperatures are higher in the LSD condition than the placebo condition
      (p = 9 \u00d7 10-5). Next, we estimate the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) complexity
      of the binarized BOLD data and the synthetic data generated with the individualized
      model using the Metropolis algorithm for each participant and condition. The
      LZW complexity computed from experimental data reveals a weak statistical relationship
      with condition (p = 0.04 one-tailed Wilcoxon test) and none with Ising temperature
      (r(13) = 0.13, p = 0.65), presumably because of the limited length of the BOLD
      time series. Similarly, we explore complexity using the block decomposition
      method (BDM), a more advanced method for estimating algorithmic complexity.
      The BDM complexity of the experimental data displays a significant correlation
      with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.56, p = 0.03) and a weak but significant correlation
      with condition (p = 0.04, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). This study suggests that
      the effects of LSD increase the complexity of brain dynamics by loosening interhemispheric
      connectivity\u2014especially homotopic links. In agreement with earlier work
      using the Ising formalism with BOLD data, we find the brain state in the placebo
      condition is already above the critical point, with LSD resulting in a shift
      further away from criticality into a more disordered state. Author summary In
      this study, we aim to characterize two brain states (psychedelics-induced and
      placebo), as captured in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data,
      with features derived from the Ising model formalism (system temperature, critical
      point, susceptibility) and from algorithmic complexity. Under the hypothesis
      that psychedelics drive the brain into a more disordered state, we study criticality
      features of brain dynamics under LSD in a within-subject study using the Ising
      model formalism and algorithmic complexity using Lempel-Ziv and the Block Decomposition
      methods. Personalized Ising models are created by first using BOLD fMRI data
      from all the subjects and conditions to create a single Ising \u201carchetype\u201d
      model\u2014which we can interpret as the average model of the data at unit temperature\u2014and
      then by adjusting the model temperature for each subject and condition. We find
      that the effects of LSD translate into increased BOLD signal complexity and
      Ising temperature, in agreement with earlier findings and predictions from existing
      theories of the effects of psychedelics, such as the relaxed beliefs under psychedelics
      (REBUS), the anarchic brain hypothesis [1], and the algorithmic information
      theory of consciousness (KT) [2, 3]. However, in contrast with some of the previously
      cited theories, we find that the system in the placebo condition is already
      in the paramagnetic phase\u2014above the critical point\u2014with ingestion
      of LSD resulting in a shift away from Ising criticality into a more disordered
      state. Finally, we highlight the fact that the structural connectome can be
      recovered to a good degree by fitting an Ising model and that the reduction
      of homotopic links appears to play an important role in the slide to disorder
      under psychedelics.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 102,

      "abstract": "Musculoskeletal refers to the muscles and skeleton of the body.
      In particular, the musculoskeletal system contains joints, muscles, bones, cartilage,
      ligaments, bursae, and tendons. In addition, the body''s movement is allowed

      a human being. Screening for musculoskeletal abnormalities is particularly critical
      as more than 1.7 billion people worldwide are affected by musculoskeletal conditions.
      Detecting whether a radiographic analysis is normal or abnormal is a critical
      radiographic issue. The most common mistake in the emergency department is the
      incorrect diagnosis of fractures, which could lead to delayed treatment and
      temporal/permanent disability. According to the latter, we can find several
      studies showing how a deep learning (DL) system can accurately detect fractures
      in the musculoskeletal system. This paper aimed to review the specific impact
      of using DL for musculoskeletal X-ray imaging. As far as we know, this is the
      first review focusing on the topic. In particular, this revision supports a
      more extensive study of the most significant aspects of machine learning (ML)
      and DL is dealing with it. It introduced the importance of using DL methods
      in musculoskeletal X-ray imaging and described MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs)

      An Integrative Review", "abstract": "Background Smart homes are becoming an
      increasingly integral part of our daily lives. Smart homes consist of domestic
      Internet of Things (IoT) products that are connected to a communication network
      and provide various functions and services to their consumers with the purpose
      of improvement of their quality of life. However previous research suggests
      there is very limited user-centric research published in this domain. One of
      the main factors for the success of smart homes is the acceptance and adoption
      of technology by new users. This report presents a literature review conducted
      with the aim of exploring smart homes, their characteristics, advantages, and
      challenges perceived by the consumer. This paper investigates various factors
      influencing the acceptance and adoption of new technologies by consumers and
      how the design of smart homes can be integrated with a product-service system
      (PSS), considering socio-cultural aspects. Methods The study is an integrative
      review of papers from major journals in design, consumer research, management,
      and marketing on the topic of smart home IoT products from 2000 to 2020 relevant
      articles were shortlisted and analyzed considering the purpose, method, and
      main findings of the studies. Results The four major categories that emerged
      through the analysis of the shortlisted articles are as follows: 1. The Terminology
      used in smart home and IoT products, 2. Consumer behavior and its relationship
      with the other factors such as benefits, barriers, and socio-cultural aspects
      in smart homes, 3. New technology acceptance, and 4. Product service system
      (PSS) design in smart homes. Conclusions A multi-faceted evaluation of articles
      of the first two categories proposes a new theoretical framework investigating
      consumer behavior related to smart homes and IoT product adoption. The framework
      is described illustrating key terms and associations between them with future
      directions on smart home IoT products. It is expected that design practitioners
      and researchers would find the developed framework helpful while designing IoT
      products.", "venue": "Archives of Design Research", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      neurophysiology, and the resulting classical paper on the McCulloch\u2010Pitts
      mathematical neuron was written in a psychiatry department almost 80\u2009years
      ago. However, the application of AI in digital neuropathology is still in its
      infancy. Rapid progress is now being made, which prompted this article. Human
      brain diseases represent distinct system states that fall outside the normal
      spectrum. Many differ not only in functional but also in structural terms, and
      the morphology of abnormal nervous tissue forms the traditional basis of neuropathological
      disease classifications. However, only a few countries have the medical specialty
      of neuropathology, and, given the sheer number of newly developed histological
      tools that can be applied to the study of brain diseases, a tremendous shortage
      of qualified hands and eyes at the microscope is obvious. Similarly, in neuroanatomy,
      human observers no longer have the capacity to process the vast amounts of connectomics
      data. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that advances in AI technology and,
      especially, whole\u2010slide image (WSI) analysis will greatly aid neuropathological
      practice. In this paper, we discuss machine learning (ML) techniques that are
      important for understanding WSI analysis, such as traditional ML and deep learning,
      introduce a recently developed neuropathological AI termed PathoFusion, and
      present thoughts on some of the challenges that must be overcome before the
      full potential of AI in digital neuropathology can be realized.", "venue": "Neuropathology

      are not clear. To clarify the boundaries of \u201copenness\u201d, we conduct
      two studies: First, we classify the types of \u201cspeech events\u201d encountered
      in a chatbot evaluation data set (i.e., Meena by Google) and find that these
      conversations mainly cover the \u201csmall talk\u201d category and exclude the
      other speech event categories encountered in real life human-human communication.
      Second, we conduct a small-scale pilot study to generate online conversations
      covering a wider range of speech event categories between two humans vs. a human
      and a state-of-the-art chatbot (i.e., Blender by Facebook). A human evaluation
      of these generated conversations indicates a preference for human-human conversations,
      since the human-chatbot conversations lack coherence in most speech event categories.
      Based on these results, we suggest (a) using the term \u201csmall talk\u201d
      instead of \u201copen-domain\u201d for the current chatbots which are not that
      \u201copen\u201d in terms of conversational abilities yet, and (b) revising
      the evaluation methods to test the chatbot conversations against other speech
      events.", "venue": "SIGDIAL Conferences", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 86,

      "As AI algorithms increasingly participate in daily activities that used to
      be the sole province of humans, we are inevitably called upon to consider how
      much machines are really like us. To address this question, we turn to the Turing

      humans. We establish a methodology to evaluate humans versus machines in Turing-like
      tests and systematically evaluate a representative set of selected domains,
      parameters, and variables. The experiments involved testing 769 human agents,
      24 state-of-the-art AI agents, 896 human judges, and 8 AI judges, in 21,570
      Turing tests across 6 tasks encompassing vision and language modalities. Surprisingly,

      the help of world knowledge and commonsense reasoning. Anaphora resolution is
      itself an important and difficult issue in natural language processing, therefore,
      many other datasets have been created to address this issue. In this paper we
      look into the Winograd schemata and other Winograd-like datasets and the translations
      of the schemata to other languages, such as Chinese, French and Portuguese.
      We present the Hungarian translation of the original Winograd schemata and a
      parallel corpus of all the translations of the schemata currently available.
      We also adapted some other anaphora resolution datasets to Hungarian. We aim
      to discuss the challenges we faced during the translation/adaption process.",

      "title": "Exhaustive Symbolic Regression", "abstract": "Symbolic Regression
      (SR) algorithms attempt to learn analytic expressions which fit data accurately
      and in a highly interpretable manner. Conventional SR suffers from two fundamental
      issues which we address here. First, these methods search the space stochastically
      (typically using genetic programming) and hence do not necessarily find the
      best function. Second, the criteria used to select the equation optimally balancing
      accuracy with simplicity have been variable and subjective. To address these
      issues we introduce Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), which systematically
      and efficiently considers all possible equations -- made with a given basis
      set of operators and up to a specified maximum complexity -- and is therefore
      guaranteed to find the true optimum (if parameters are perfectly optimised)
      and a complete function ranking subject to these constraints. We implement the
      minimum description length principle as a rigorous method for combining these
      preferences into a single objective. To illustrate the power of ESR we apply
      it to a catalogue of cosmic chronometers and the Pantheon+ sample of supernovae
      to learn the Hubble rate as a function of redshift, finding $\\sim$40 functions
      (out of 5.2 million trial functions) that fit the data more economically than
      the Friedmann equation. These low-redshift data therefore do not uniquely prefer
      the expansion history of the standard model of cosmology. We make our code and
      full equation sets publicly available.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary

      "This work is intended as a voice in the discussion over previous claims that
      a pretrained large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer model architecture
      can be sentient. Such claims have been made concerning the LaMDA model and also
      concerning the current wave of LLM-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT. This claim,
      if confirmed, would have serious ramifications in the Natural Language Processing
      (NLP) community due to wide-spread use of similar models. However, here we take
      the position that such a large language model cannot be sentient, or conscious,
      and that LaMDA in particular exhibits no advances over other similar models
      that would qualify it. We justify this by analysing the Transformer architecture
      through Integrated Information Theory of consciousness. We see the claims of
      sentience as part of a wider tendency to use anthropomorphic language in NLP
      reporting. Regardless of the veracity of the claims, we consider this an opportune
      moment to take stock of progress in language modelling and consider the ethical
      implications of the task. In order to make this work helpful for readers outside
      the NLP community, we also present the necessary background in language modelling.",

      Accessible published literature studies that primarily focus on automation of

      increased automation of systematic literature reviews. This area has attracted
      increase attention in the last decade due to significant gaps in the applicability

      Analysis", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly
      present in organizations. In the specific case of Human Resource Management
      (HRM), AI has become increasingly relevant in recent years. This article aims
      to perform a bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature that addresses
      in a connected way the application and impact of AI in the field of HRM. The
      scientific databases consulted were Web of Science and Scopus, yielding an initial
      number of 156 articles, of which 73 were selected for subsequent analysis. The
      information was processed using the Bibliometrix tool, which provided information
      on annual production, analysis of journals, authors, documents, keywords, etc.
      The results obtained show that AI applied to HRM is a developing field of study
      with constant growth and a positive future vision, although it should also be
      noted that it has a very specific character as a result of the fact that most
      of the research is focused on the application of AI in recruitment and selection
      actions, leaving aside other sub-areas with a great potential for application.",

      "title": "Feeling(s) without Organs", "abstract": "One of our big ambitions
      on the way to performing the human experience is to grasp the logic of feeling(s).
      Diagrams have been a method on this way thanks to their specific format for
      organizing abstract problems. They are utilized whenever language and body fail
      at emotional expression. Diagramming feelings dates back to Antiquity. The first
      attempts in this respect come from Chrysippus of Soli (c.279\u2013c.206 BC)
      \u2013 Greek Stoic philosopher and author of On Passion whose fourfold table
      of emotions is still widely employed in contemporary taxonomies of human sentience
      (see Knuuttila 2016). A notable advancement in diagrams for feelings overlaps
      with the development of print in the fourteen and fifteenth centuries. It was
      a period of intense obsession with solutions of geometrically expressed logic
      for non-mathematical truths, including feelings and virtues (Gardner 1958: 1).
      The blueprints for sensations and emotions from the early modern era \u2013
      such as graphs (for example, Aristotle\u2019s squares of opposition), trees
      (for example, Porphyrian \u2018scale of being\u2019), and revolving discs (for
      example, Llullist visual combinatorics) \u2013 have prevailed until now. Contemporary
      psychology continues to accommodate diagrammatic imagery (for example, Plutchik\u2019s
      \u2018Wheel of Emotions\u2019) even if the meanings of emotional states now
      and then are very divergent. High-tech revolution has brought a visible upgrade
      to this trend. With technological expansion, the use of diagrams for emotional
      expression gains new traction. So does the performance of feelings. As our experiences
      get radically externalized by technological extensions (platforms, addons, projections),
      emotions leave the body. More importantly, emotional blueprints show their own
      sentient exuberance, as if they had, and experienced, feelings of their own.
      The emotional premise of diagrams (just like the diagrammatic premise of emotions)
      is that feelings are beyond-the-body occurrences. Thanks to technological schemes
      used for representing emotional states, we can see that emotions do not belong
      to \u2018sites\u2019 (for example, human body) but exist through a variety of
      environments and mediums. We can also see that they do not mean one thing. It
      is perhaps because diagrams enable new meanings that draw on their own \u2018ontological
      conceptualization\u2019 (van Berkel and Bos 1998a). According to Stan Allen,
      diagrams map objects or systems in a way that \u2018anticipates new organizations
      and specifies yet to be realized relations\u2019 (1998: 16). They expose the
      missing signification ascribed to experiences and unveil their hidden senses.
      At the same time, they are \u2018reductive machines\u2019, limited in \u2018their
      tendency to compress information\u2019 (van Berkel and Bo 1998b: 20). The paradox
      of the diagrammed feeling lies in the conflicting materialities of the emotion
      and of the reductive machines. Feelings are futile. We cannot see them, we cannot
      touch them, and we can hardly express them in language. Although they exist,
      we do not know exactly where they come from and how they are being formed as
      they defy representation and are impossible to capture in a reliable manner,
      let alone properly identify in terms of their location \u2013 in and outside
      the sites of their origins. All depictions of feeling(s) \u2013 those visible
      in our (and other) bodies as well as those existing in taxonomies \u2013 are
      provisional and imprecise. This is due to both the fleeting nature of sentience
      and the conflict between the ambiguity of emotional states and diagrammatic
      proclivity for accuracy. And yet, emotions are perfectly diagrammable \u2013
      which says a lot about the nature of emotions 1 This article was supported by

      Intelligence", "abstract": "Human creativity has been often aided and supported
      by artificial tools, spanning traditional tools such as ideation cards, pens,
      and paper, to computed and software. Tools for creativity are increasingly using
      artificial intelligence to not only support the creative process, but also to
      act upon the creation with a higher level of agency. This paper focuses on writing
      fiction as a creative activity and explores human-AI co-writing through a research
      product, which employs a natural language processing model, the Generative Pre-trained
      Transformer 3 (GPT-3), to assist the co-authoring of narrative fiction. We report
      on two progressive \u2013 not comparative \u2013 autoethnographic studies to
      attain our own creative practices in light of our engagement with the research
      product: (1) a co-writing activity initiated by basic textual prompts using
      basic elements of narrative and (2) a co-writing activity initiated by more
      advanced textual prompts using elements of narrative, including dialects and
      metaphors undertaken by one of the authors of this paper who has doctoral training
      in literature. In both studies, we quickly came up against the limitations of
      the system; then, we repositioned our goals and practices to maximize our chances
      of success. As a result, we discovered not only limitations but also hidden
      capabilities, which not only altered our creative practices and outcomes, but
      which began to change the ways we were relating to the AI as collaborator.",

      "title": "An Overview on Controllable Text Generation via Variational Auto-Encoders",
      "abstract": "Recent advances in neural-based generative modeling have reignited
      the hopes of having computer systems capable of conversing with humans and able
      to understand natural language. The employment of deep neural architectures
      has been largely explored in a multitude of context and tasks to fulfill various
      user needs. On one hand, producing textual content that meets specific requirements
      is of priority for a model to seamlessly conduct conversations with different
      groups of people. On the other hand, latent variable models (LVM) such as variational
      auto-encoders (VAEs) as one of the most popular genres of generative models
      are designed to characterize the distributional pattern of textual data. Thus
      they are inherently capable of learning the integral textual features that are
      worth exploring for controllable pursuits. \\noindent This overview gives an

      studies the problem of measuring and predicting how memorable an image is to
      pattern recognition machines, as a path to explore machine intelligence. Firstly,
      we propose a self-supervised machine memory quantification pipeline, dubbed
      ``MachineMem measurer'''', to collect machine memorability scores of images.
      Similar to humans, machines also tend to memorize certain kinds of images, whereas
      the types of images that machines and humans memorize are different. Through
      in-depth analysis and comprehensive visualizations, we gradually unveil that``complex\"images
      are usually more memorable to machines. We further conduct extensive experiments
      across 11 different machines (from linear classifiers to modern ViTs) and 9
      pre-training methods to analyze and understand machine memory. This work proposes
      the concept of machine memorability and opens a new research direction at the
      interface between machine memory and visual data.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

      once the lower limb muscles are strong enough, can learn to walk by coming to
      support his or her upper trunk. Ideally, this algorithm-supported locomotion
      can take the baby to any desired location: a pile of toys, a tasty snack, or
      the baby''s parents or relatives. In this paper we analyze the crawling stage,
      the simple 2d bipedal model, and the initial walking form from 8 to 18 months
      of age, and quantitatively evaluate the ideal kinematics model and simulation

      intelligence is currently powering diverse real-world applications. These applications
      have shown promising performance, but raise complicated ethical issues, i.e.
      how to embed ethics to make AI applications behave morally. One way toward moral
      AI systems is by imitating human prosocial behavior and encouraging some form
      of good behavior in systems. However, learning such normative ethics (especially
      from images) is challenging mainly due to a lack of data and labeling complexity.
      Here, we propose a model that predicts visual commonsense immorality in a zero-shot
      manner. We train our model with an ETHICS dataset (a pair of text and morality
      annotation) via a CLIP-based image-text joint embedding. In a testing phase,
      the immorality of an unseen image is predicted. We evaluate our model with existing
      moral/immoral image datasets and show fair prediction performance consistent
      with human intuitions. Further, we create a visual commonsense immorality benchmark
      with more general and extensive immoral visual contents. Codes and dataset are
      available at https://github.com/ku-vai/Zero-shot-Visual-Commonsense-Immorality-Prediction.

      in astronomy", "abstract": "In this review, we explore the historical development
      and future prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning in astronomy.
      We trace the evolution of connectionism in astronomy through its three waves,
      from the early use of multilayer perceptrons, to the rise of convolutional and
      recurrent neural networks, and finally to the current era of unsupervised and
      generative deep learning methods. With the exponential growth of astronomical
      data, deep learning techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to uncover
      valuable insights and tackle previously intractable problems. As we enter the
      anticipated fourth wave of astronomical connectionism, we argue for the adoption
      of GPT-like foundation models fine-tuned for astronomical applications. Such
      models could harness the wealth of high-quality, multimodal astronomical data
      to serve state-of-the-art downstream tasks. To keep pace with advancements driven
      by Big Tech, we propose a collaborative, open-source approach within the astronomy
      community to develop and maintain these foundation models, fostering a symbiotic
      relationship between AI and astronomy that capitalizes on the unique strengths

      Reasoning Systems", "abstract": "Machine commonsense reasoning (MCR) systems
      can significantly improve the way we interact with machines. MCR systems are
      therefore an important element in any human-centric applications. Recent advances
      in machine learning (ML) have enabled breakthroughs in MCR technologies. This
      paper aims to improve healthcare outcomes by making human-machine interactions
      more intuitive than before. It presents learning models developed for MCR. Specifically,
      it presents a critical analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models
      for MCR. These include recurrent neural network (RNN), transfer learning (TL),
      and transformers. Transformers, in particular, have been found to be effective
      for a range of natural language processing (NLP) applications, including MCR.
      Based on the analysis, another contribution of this paper is to assemble useful
      MCR tools into an adaptable MCR toolbox. To ensure broad applicability, the
      toolbox can be customizable for different MCR applications. Our research focuses
      on two specific MCR applications: commonsense validation and commonsense explanation.
      The former concerns identifying statements that do not make commonsense. The
      latter aims at explaining the reason why a given statement does not make commonsense.
      The paper presents some preliminary results of applying elements of the assembled
      toolbox to the two MCR applications. These results indicate that it is possible
      to achieve near human performances using finely-tuned state-of-the-art DL methods

      is transforming the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enhancing the trust
      of end-users in machines. As the number of connected devices keeps on growing,
      the Internet of Things (IoT) market needs to be trustworthy for the end-users.
      However, existing literature still lacks a systematic and comprehensive survey
      work on the use of XAI for IoT. To bridge this lacking, in this paper, we address
      the XAI frameworks with a focus on their characteristics and support for IoT.
      We illustrate the widely-used XAI services for IoT applications, such as security
      enhancement, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), and Internet
      of City Things (IoCT). We also suggest the implementation choice of XAI models
      over IoT systems in these applications with appropriate examples and summarize
      the key inferences for future works. Moreover, we present the cutting-edge development

      the knowledge and attitudes of medical students in Lebanon toward Artificial
      Intelligence (AI) in medical education. It also explores the students'' perspectives
      regarding the role of AI in medical education as a subject in the curriculum
      and a teaching tool. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using an online
      survey consisting of close-ended questions. The survey targets medical students
      at all medical levels across the 7 medical schools in Lebanon. Results A total
      of 206 medical students responded. When assessing AI knowledge sources (81.1%)
      got their information from the media as compared to (9.7%) from medical school
      curriculum. However, Students who learned the basics of AI as part of the medical
      school curriculum were more knowledge about AI than their peers who did not.
      Students in their clinical years appear to be more knowledgeable about AI in
      medicine. The advancements in AI affected the choice of specialty of around
      a quarter of the students (26.8%). Finally, only a quarter of students (26.5%)
      want to be assessed by AI, even though the majority (57.7%) reported that assessment
      by AI is more objective. Conclusions Education about AI should be incorporated
      in the medical school curriculum to improve the knowledge and attitudes of medical
      students. Improving AI knowledge in medical students will in turn increase acceptance
      of AI as a tool in medical education, thus unlocking its potential in revolutionizing

      A Systematic Literature Review", "abstract": "According to the World Health
      Organization, about 15% of the world\u2019s population has some form of disability.
      Assistive Technology, in this context, contributes directly to the overcoming
      of difficulties encountered by people with disabilities in their daily lives,
      allowing them to receive education and become part of the labor market and society
      in a worthy manner. Assistive Technology has made great advances in its integration
      with Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices. AIoT processes and analyzes
      the large amount of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applies
      Artificial Intelligence models, specifically, machine learning, to discover
      patterns for generating insights and assisting in decision making. Based on
      a systematic literature review, this article aims to identify the machine-learning
      models used across different research on Artificial Intelligence of Things applied
      to Assistive Technology. The survey of the topics approached in this article
      also highlights the context of such research, their application, the IoT devices
      used, and gaps and opportunities for further development. The survey results
      show that 50% of the analyzed research address visual impairment, and, for this
      reason, most of the topics cover issues related to computational vision. Portable
      devices, wearables, and smartphones constitute the majority of IoT devices.
      Deep neural networks represent 81% of the machine-learning models applied in
      the reviewed research.", "venue": "Italian National Conference on Sensors",

      of EEG-Based BCIs", "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer
      interfaces (BCIs) are used in many applications, due to their low-risk, low-cost,
      and convenience. Because of EEG\u2019s high variations across subjects and sessions,
      a long calibration session is usually needed to adjust the system before each
      use, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly. Though various machine learning
      approaches have been proposed to cope with this problem, none of them considered
      individual differences, data scarcity and data privacy simultaneously. In this
      paper, a Multi-Domain Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MDMAML) approach is proposed
      to address challenging cross-subject, few-shot and source-free (privacy protection)
      classification tasks in EEG-based BCIs. Experiments on four datasets from two
      different BCI paradigms demonstrated that MDMAML outperformed several classical
      and state-of-the-art approaches in both online and offline applications.", "venue":

      Literature Review", "abstract": "The student portal gives users access to the
      channels of information and resources that they require for their academic pursuits.
      This includes access to the library services, information about their courses,
      and academic-related materials. On the other hand, this progress is not without
      its problems, as most of these services have a finite lifespan while the team
      still supports them. The student portal should build an artificial intelligence
      (AI) agent, like a chatbot, to provide 24/7 support for its users. This Chatbot
      must have a straight-forward user interface or GUI with excellent efficiency;
      hence it must be a simple system that users with minimal technical understanding
      can operate. It is intended that by acting as a customer support representative,
      a chatbot can enhance the user experience on student portal. This paper presents
      the findings from systematic literature review on previous works of intelligent
      chatbot implementation in student portal. Out of six main journal search engines
      and 100 articles found related to this study, only 21 articles are taken into
      consideration for further analysis. The results from existing studies on chatbot
      are tagged to nine categories based on content, and the findings are elaborated
      in terms of the implementation challenges of chatbot for student portal.", "venue":

      (AI) methods have revolutionized and redefined the landscape of data analysis
      in business, healthcare, and technology. These methods have innovated the applied
      mathematics, computer science, and engineering fields and are showing considerable
      potential for risk science, especially in the disaster risk domain. The disaster
      risk field has yet to define itself as a necessary application domain for AI
      implementation by defining how to responsibly balance AI and disaster risk.
      (1) How is AI being used for disaster risk applications; and how are these applications
      addressing the principles and assumptions of risk science, (2) What are the
      benefits of AI being used for risk applications; and what are the benefits of
      applying risk principles and assumptions for AI\u2010based applications, (3)
      What are the synergies between AI and risk science applications, and (4) What
      are the characteristics of effective use of fundamental risk principles and
      assumptions for AI\u2010based applications? This study develops and disseminates
      an online survey questionnaire that leverages expertise from risk and AI professionals
      to identify the most important characteristics related to AI and risk, then
      presents a framework for gauging how AI and disaster risk can be balanced. This
      study is the first to develop a classification system for applying risk principles
      for AI\u2010based applications. This classification contributes to understanding
      of AI and risk by exploring how AI can be used to manage risk, how AI methods

      and Effective Text Generation", "abstract": "We study the text generation task
      under the approach of pre-trained language models (PLMs). Typically, an auto-regressive
      (AR) method is adopted for generating texts in a token-by-token manner. Despite
      many advantages of AR generation, it usually suffers from inefficient inference.
      Therefore, non-autoregressive (NAR) models are proposed to generate all target
      tokens simultaneously. However, NAR models usually generate texts of lower quality
      due to the absence of token dependency in the output text. In this paper, we
      propose ELMER: an efficient and effective PLM for NAR text generation to explicitly
      model the token dependency during NAR generation. By leveraging the early exit
      technique, ELMER enables the token generations at different layers, according
      to their prediction confidence (a more confident token will exit at a lower
      layer). Besides, we propose a novel pre-training objective, Layer Permutation
      Language Modeling, to pre-train ELMER by permuting the exit layer for each token
      in sequences. Experiments on three text generation tasks show that ELMER significantly
      outperforms NAR models and further narrows the performance gap with AR PLMs
      (ELMER (29.92) vs BART (30.61) ROUGE-L in XSUM) while achieving over 10 times

      "title": "Symbolic Distillation for Learned TCP Congestion Control", "abstract":
      "Recent advances in TCP congestion control (CC) have achieved tremendous success
      with deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which use feedforward neural
      networks (NN) to learn complex environment conditions and make better decisions.
      However, such\"black-box\"policies lack interpretability and reliability, and
      often, they need to operate outside the traditional TCP datapath due to the
      use of complex NNs. This paper proposes a novel two-stage solution to achieve
      the best of both worlds: first to train a deep RL agent, then distill its (over-)parameterized
      NN policy into white-box, light-weight rules in the form of symbolic expressions
      that are much easier to understand and to implement in constrained environments.
      At the core of our proposal is a novel symbolic branching algorithm that enables
      the rule to be aware of the context in terms of various network conditions,
      eventually converting the NN policy into a symbolic tree. The distilled symbolic
      rules preserve and often improve performance over state-of-the-art NN policies
      while being faster and simpler than a standard neural network. We validate the
      performance of our distilled symbolic rules on both simulation and emulation
      environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/SymbolicPCC.",

      "Recognizing human partners is an essential social skill for building personalized
      and long-term human-robot interactions. However, robots deployed in complex,
      real-world environments have to face several challenges, such as managing unstructured
      interactions with multiple users, limited computational resources, and intrinsic
      and continuous variability of their sensory evidence. To cope with these challenges,
      we propose a framework to perform autonomous incremental learning for open-set
      face recognition suitable for unconstrained HRI scenarios. We validated the
      proposed framework in a real-world experiment, demonstrating its suitability
      to let the robot autonomously interact with multiple people while creating a
      labeled database of their faces across various encounters. Furthermore, we evaluated
      how an off-the-shelf model performed with data gathered from the HRI setting
      and proposed a fine-tuned model obtained with a transfer learning technique.
      Analyses about automatic threshold determination and rehearsal methods for memory
      sampling were also proposed. Our preliminary results suggest that exploiting
      the first-hand robot''s experience could be crucial to ensure better models''
      performance and, therefore, could be advantageous for the acceptance and effectiveness
      of social robots in the long run. With this work, we aim to provide insights

      anthropomorphic responses might make users uncomfortable or implicitly deceive
      them into thinking they are interacting with a human. We collect human ratings
      on the feasibility of approximately 900 two-turn dialogs sampled from 9 diverse
      data sources. Ratings are for two hypothetical machine embodiments: a futuristic
      humanoid robot and a digital assistant. We find that for some data-sources commonly
      used to train dialog systems, 20-30% of utterances are not viewed as possible
      for a machine. Rating is marginally affected by machine embodiment. We explore
      qualitative and quantitative reasons for these ratings. Finally, we build classifiers
      and explore how modeling configuration might affect output permissibly, and
      discuss implications for building less falsely anthropomorphic dialog systems.",

      of solutions available for relevant problems, to the HRI community. However,
      members of the AI-HRI research community will point out that the relationship
      has a deeper synergy than matchmaking problems and solutions -- there are insights
      from each field that impact how the other one thinks about the world and performs
      scientific research. There is no greater opportunity for sharing perspectives
      at the moment than human-aware AI, which studies how to account for the fact
      that people are more than a source of data or part of an algorithm. We will

      "Conversational agents are getting more popular and applied in a wide range
      of practical application areas. The main task of these agents is not only to
      generate context-appropriate responses to a given query but also to make the
      conversation human-like. Thanks to the ability of deep learning based models
      in natural language modeling, recent studies have made progress in designing
      conversational agents that can provide more semantically accurate responses.
      However, the naturalness in such conversation setting has not been given adequate
      attention in these studies. This paper aims to incorporate both important criteria
      of accuracy and naturalness of conversation in developing a new model for conversational
      agents. To this end, inspired by the idea of Turing test and the idea of adversarial
      learning strategy, we propose to design a model based on generative deep neural
      networks that interestingly allow to generate accurate responses optimized by
      the mechanics of imitating human-generated conversations. Experimental results
      demonstrate that the proposed models produce more natural and accurate responses,
      yielding significant gains in BLEU scores.", "venue": "International Conference

      Using Chest CT Images", "abstract": "Starting from December 2019, the global
      pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is continuously expanding and
      has caused several millions of deaths worldwide. Fast and accurate diagnostic
      methods for COVID-19 detection play a vital role in containing the plague. Chest
      computed tomography (CT) is one of the most commonly used diagnosis methods.
      However, a complete CT-scan has hundreds of slices, and it is time-consuming
      for radiologists to check each slice to diagnose COVID-19. This study introduces
      a novel method for fast and automated COVID-19 diagnosis using the chest CT
      scans. The proposed models are based on the state-of-the-art deep convolutional
      neural network (CNN) architecture, and a 2D global max pooling (globalMaxPool2D)
      layer is used to improve the performance. We compare the proposed models to
      the existing state-of-the-art deep learning models such as CNN based models
      and vision transformer (ViT) models. Based off of metric such as area under
      curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and false discovery rate (FDR),
      experimental results show that the proposed models outperform the previous methods,
      and the best model achieves an area under curve of 0.9744 and accuracy 94.12%
      on our test datasets. It is also shown that the accuracy is improved by around
      1% by using the 2D global max pooling layer. Moreover, a heatmap method to highlight
      the lesion area on COVID-19 chest CT images is introduced in the paper. This
      heatmap method is helpful for a radiologist to identify the abnormal pattern
      of COVID-19 on chest CT images. In addition, we also developed a freely accessible
      online simulation software for automated COVID-19 detection using CT images.
      The proposed deep learning models and software tool can be used by radiologist
      to diagnose COVID-19 more accurately and efficiently.", "venue": "Computational

      to Entities", "abstract": "Despite the Digital Twin (DT) concept being in the
      industry for a long time, it remains ambiguous, unable to differentiate itself
      from information models, general computing, and simulation technologies. Part
      of this confusion stems from previous studies overlooking the DT\u2019s bidirectional
      nature, that enables the shift of agency (delegating control) from humans to
      physical elements, something that was not possible with earlier technologies.
      Thus, we present DTs in a new light by viewing them as a means of imparting
      intelligence and agency to entities, emphasizing that DTs are not just expert-centric

      "In this note, we first derive a one-parameter family of hyperparameter scaling
      strategies that interpolates between the neural-tangent scaling and mean-field/maximal-update
      scaling. We then calculate the scalings of dynamical observables -- network
      outputs, neural tangent kernels, and differentials of neural tangent kernels
      -- for wide and deep neural networks. These calculations in turn reveal a proper
      way to scale depth with width such that resultant large-scale models maintain
      their representation-learning ability. Finally, we observe that various infinite-width
      limits examined in the literature correspond to the distinct corners of the
      interconnected web spanned by effective theories for finite-width neural networks,
      with their training dynamics ranging from being weakly-coupled to being strongly-coupled.",

      in the financial market have gradually changed from traditional on-site trading
      to electronic remote trading, and even online automatic trading performed by
      pre-programmed computer programs. This is due to the conduct of trading automatically
      and self-adjustment in financial markets becoming a competitive development
      trend in the entire financial market, with the continuous development of network
      and computer computing technology. Quantitative trading aims to automatically
      form a fixed and quantifiable operational logic from people\u2019s investment
      decisions and apply it to the financial market, which has attracted the attention
      of the financial market. The development of self-adjustment programming algorithms
      for automatically trading in financial markets has transformed to being a top
      priority for academic research and financial practice. Thus, a new flexible
      grid trading model incorporating the Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO) algorithm
      for optimizing parameters for various market situations as input values and
      the Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model
      for training a quantitative trading model for automatically calculating and
      adjusting the optimal trading parameters for trading after inputting the existing
      market situation are developed and studied in this work. The proposed model
      provides a self-adjust model to reduce investors\u2019 effort in the trading

      their identity is an integral part of daily life. From our fingerprints to our
      facial features, our physical characteristics store the information that identifies
      us as \"us.\" This biometric information is becoming increasingly vital to the
      way we access and use technology. As more and more platform operators struggle
      with traffic from malicious bots on their servers, the burden of proof is on
      users, only this time they have to prove their very humanity and there is no
      court or jury to judge, but an invisible algorithmic system. In this paper,
      we critique the invisibilization of artificial intelligence policing. We argue
      that this practice obfuscates the underlying process of biometric verification.
      As a result, the new \"invisible\" tests leave no room for the user to question
      whether the process of questioning is even fair or ethical. We challenge this
      thesis by offering a juxtaposition with the science fiction imagining of the
      Turing test in Blade Runner to reevaluate the ethical grounds for reverse Turing
      tests, and we urge the research community to pursue alternative routes of bot
      identification that are more transparent and responsive.", "venue": "Nordic

      poses a severe threat to academic integrity, as plagiarists can generate realistic

      detection is still incipient in the literature.This work explores T5 and GPT3
      for machine-paraphrase generation on scientific articles from arXiv, student
      theses, and Wikipedia.We evaluate the detection performance of six automated
      solutions and one commercial plagiarism detection software and perform a human
      study with 105 participants regarding their detection performance and the quality
      of generated examples.Our results suggest that large language models can rewrite
      text humans have difficulty identifying as machine-paraphrased (53% mean acc.).Human
      experts rate the quality of paraphrases generated by GPT-3 as high as original
      texts (clarity 4.0/5, fluency 4.2/5, coherence 3.8/5).The best-performing detection
      model (GPT-3) achieves 66% F1-score in detecting paraphrases.We make our code,

      decades have seen a flourishing of scholarship on wellbeing. Looking ahead,
      the next frontier may be engaging with the possibility of non-human forms of
      wellbeing. This paper reviews various candidates for what these forms may be,
      focusing on entities that are living and potentially capable of conscious experience.
      However, what makes this topic so complex and fascinating is that what exactly
      constitutes life or conscious experience is not self-evident. Thus, this paper
      considers various potential life forms \u2013 which vary in the extent to which
      they challenge standard conceptions of life \u2013 including organic life forms
      on earth, matter, AI, and extra-terrestrial beings. Some possibilities are unlikelier
      and more speculative than others, but all have arguably a non-zero probability,
      so merit at least some consideration and attention. Moreover, these possibilities
      have considerable relevance for human wellbeing, and so warrant the attention
      of wellbeing scholars.", "venue": "Journal of Positive Psychology", "year":

      "ABSTRACT Driven by the need to provide continuous, timely, and efficient customer
      service, firms are constantly experimenting with emerging technological solutions.
      In recent times firms have shown an increased interest in designing and implementing
      artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactional technologies, such as conversational
      AI agents and chatbots, that obviate the need for having human service agents
      for the provision of customer service. However, the business impact of conversational
      AI is contingent on customers using and adequately engaging with these tools.
      This engagement depends, in turn, on conversational AI\u2019s similarity, or
      likeness to the human beings it is intended to replace. Businesses therefore
      need to understand what human-like characteristics and competencies should be
      embedded in customer-facing conversational AI agents to facilitate smooth user
      interaction. This focus on \u201chuman-likeness\u201d for facilitating user
      engagement in the case of conversational AI agents is in sharp contrast to most
      prior information systems (IS) user engagement research, which is predicated
      on the \u201cinstrumental value\u201d of information technology (IT). Grounding
      our work in the individual human competency and media naturalness literatures,
      we theorize the key role of human-like interactional competencies in conversational
      AI agents\u2014specifically, cognitive, relational, and emotional competencies\u2014in
      facilitating user engagement. We also hypothesize the mediating role of user
      trust in these relationships. Following a sequential mixed methods approach,
      we use a quantitative two-wave, survey-based study to test our model. We then
      examine the results in light of findings from qualitative follow-up interviews
      with a sampled set of conversational AI users. Together, the results offer a
      nuanced understanding of desirable human-like competencies in conversational
      AI agents and the salient role of user trust in fostering user engagement with
      them. We also discuss the implications of our study for research and practice.",

      "abstract": "The secondary operations of composite parts are performed following
      thermal cure processes, which generate the final dimensions with desired tolerance
      and quality specifications. High-strength composites, on the other hand, especially
      aramid fiber-reinforced polymers (AFRP), are not suitable for conventional machining
      operations due in part to high operational costs and limited surface quality
      characterized by fuzziness and delamination. Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) has been
      recently shown promising results in obtaining improved surface quality while
      ensuring significant cost advantages. This study investigates the AWJ processing
      of AFRP by implementing the analysis of variance and response surface methods.
      The effects of the control parameters (sand ratio, pressure, stand-off-distance,
      and feed rate) on the surface quality metrics (surface roughness, kerf angle,
      and dimensional error) are identified and comparatively evaluated. The surface
      quality of the AWJ processed AFRP specimens are investigated using Scanning
      Electron Microscopy (SEM). The trade-offs between the measured tolerances and
      surface roughness values are identified via a new genetic algorithm approach:
      Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). Also, operation regions
      are determined using the generated Pareto curves while improving the quality
      of various features of an AFRP component, critical to its functional performance
      during extended service life. As a result, the lowest Ra values obtained were
      4.135\u2005\u00b5m for trimming, 5.962\u2005\u00b5m for pocketing, and 4.696\u2005\u00b5m
      for the hole-making operation. The maximum error in the accuracy of operating
      regions yields to 7% with independent measurements for validation.", "venue":

      "In teleoperated Robot-Assisted Minimally-Invasive Surgery (RAMIS), a surgeon
      controls the movements of instruments inside the patient\u2019s body via a pair

      full potential is still to be realized. In this chapter we propose a pathway

      traditional system centered and the more recent human-centred approaches to
      teleoperation, and the special considerations for RAMIS as an application of
      teleoperation. However, the human-centered approach is still one sided view
      focusing on the surgeon but neglecting the learning capabilities of robotic
      systems. Hence, we consider a more general idea of physical human-robot orchestration

      A Literature Review", "abstract": "Today\u2019s world is changing dramatically
      due to the influence of various factors. Whether due to the rapid development
      of technological tools, advances in telecommunication methods, global economic
      and social events, or other reasons, almost everything is changing. As a result,
      the concepts of a \u201cjob\u201d or work have changed as well, with new work
      shifts being introduced and the office no longer being the only place where
      work is done. In addition, our non-stop active society has increased the stress
      and pressure at work, causing fatigue to spread worldwide and becoming a global
      problem. Moreover, it is medically proven that persistent fatigue is a cause
      of serious diseases and health problems. Therefore, monitoring and detecting
      fatigue in the workplace is essential to improve worker safety in the long term.
      In this paper, we provide an overview of the use of smart wearable devices to
      monitor and detect occupational physical fatigue. In addition, we present and
      discuss the challenges that hinder this field and highlight what can be done
      to advance the use of smart wearables in workplace fatigue detection.", "venue":

      Overview, and Challenges", "abstract": "Inspection methods, also known as non-destructive
      evaluation (NDE), is a process for inspecting materials, products, and facilities
      to identify flaws, imperfections, and malfunctions without destruction or changing
      the integrity of materials, structures, and mechanisms. However, detecting those
      defects requires test conducting and results inferring, which is highly demanding
      in terms of analysis, performance, and time. New technologies are therefore
      needed to increase the efficiency, probability of detection, and interpretability
      of NDE methods to establish smart inspection. In this context, Artificial intelligence
      (AI), as a fundamental component of the Industry 4.0, is a well-suited tool
      to address downsides associated with the current NDE methods for analysis and
      interpretation of inspection results, where methods integrating AI into their
      inspection process become automated and are known as smart inspection methods.
      This article sheds a light on the conventional methods and the smart techniques
      used in defects detection. Subsequently, a comparison between the two notions
      is presented. Furthermore, it investigates opportunities for the integration
      of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods and Industry 4.0 technologies. In
      addition, the challenges hindering the progress of the domain are mentioned
      as the potential solutions. To this end, along with Industry 4.0 technologies,
      a virtual inspection system has been proposed to deploy smart inspection.",

      "Today''s data-driven decisions are largely dependent on professional analysts
      conducting analysis and generating visualizations for decision makers. These

      scenario where intelligent interactive visualization systems may replace analysts
      in the decision-making process when the analyses and visualizations are relatively
      simple. However, three gaps need to be addressed before the future scenario
      could be realized. In this paper, I will discuss these gaps, propose potential

      data and thus are fundamentally different from real-life conversations, which
      are more noisy and casual. Recently, the SereTOD challenge is organized and
      releases the MobileCS dataset, which consists of real-world dialog transcripts
      between real users and customerservice staffs from China Mobile. Based on the
      MobileCS dataset, the SereTOD challenge has two tasks, not only evaluating the
      construction of the dialogue system itself, but also examining information extraction
      from dialog transcripts, which is crucial for building the knowledge base for
      TOD. This paper mainly presents a baseline study of the two tasks with the MobileCS
      dataset. We introduce how the two baselines are constructed, the problems encountered,
      and the results. We anticipate that the baselines can facilitate exciting future
      research to build human-robot dialogue systems for real-life tasks.", "venue":

      intelligence (AI) technologies are now widely employed in China\u2019s medical
      and healthcare fields. Enormous amounts of personal data are collected from
      various sources and inserted into AI algorithms for medical purposes, producing
      challenges to patient\u2019s privacy. This is a comparative study of Chinese,
      United States, and European Union operational rules for healthcare data that
      is collected and then used in AI functions, particularly focusing on legal differences
      and deficiencies. The conceptual boundaries of privacy and personal information,
      the influence of technological development on the informed consent model, and
      conflicts between freedom and security in rules of cross-border data flow were
      found to be key issues requiring consideration when regulating healthcare data
      used for AI purposes. Furthermore, the results indicate that the appropriate
      balance between privacy protections and technological development, between individual
      and group interests, and between corporate profits and the public interest should
      be identified and observed. In terms of specific rule-making, it was found that
      China should establish special regulations protecting healthcare information,
      provide clear definitions and classification schemas for different types of
      healthcare information, and enact stricter accountability mechanisms. Examining
      and contrasting operational rules for AI in health care promotes informed privacy

      to reconsider either model structures or the available data more closely, that
      is to challenge our fundamental understanding of the problem at hand. It is

      that the sources of uncertainty in environmental modelling will often be epistemic

      "In this article, we argue that game jam formats are uniquely suited to engage
      participants in learning about artificial intelligence (AI) as a design material
      because of four factors which are characteristic of game jams: 1) Game jams
      provide an opportunity for hands-on, interactive prototyping, 2) Game jams encourage
      playful participation, 3) Game jams encourage creative combinations of AI and
      game development, and 4) Game jams offer understandable goals and evaluation
      metrics for AI. We support the argument with an interview study conducted with
      three AI experts who had all organized game jams with a focus on using AI in
      game development. Based on a thematic analysis of the expert interviews and
      a theoretical background of Sch\u00f6n''s work on educating the reflective practitioner,
      we identified the four abovementioned factors as well as four recommendations
      for structuring and planning an AI-focused game jam: 1) Aligning repertoires,
      2) Supporting playful participation, 3) Supporting ideation, and 4) Facilitating
      evaluation and reflection. Our contribution is motivated by the recent discourse
      on general challenges and recommendations of teaching AI identified by related
      literature, here under the long and intertwined history of games and AI in general.

      "title": "Trust, Ethics, Consciousness, and Artificial Intelligence", "abstract":
      "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to proliferate across manufacturing,
      economic, medical, aerospace, transportation, and social realms, ethical guidelines
      must be established to not only protect humans at the mercy of automated decision
      making, but also autonomous agents themselves, should they become conscious.
      While AI appears \"smart\" to the public, and may outperform humans on specific
      tasks, the truth is that today\u2019s AI lacks insight beyond the restricted
      scope of problems to which it has been tasked. Without context, AI is effectively
      incapable of comprehending the true nature of what it does and is oblivious
      to the reverberations it may cause in the real world should it err in prediction.
      Despite this, future AI may be equipped with enough sensors and neural processing
      capacity to acquire a dynamic cognizance more akin to humans. If this materializes,
      will autonomous agents question their own position in this world? One must entertain
      the possibility that this is not merely hypothetical but may, in fact, be imminent
      if humanity succeeds in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI).If autonomous
      agents with the capacity for artificial consciousness are delegated grueling
      tasks, outcomes could mirror the plight of exploited workers, result in retaliation,
      failure to comply, alternative objectives, or breakdown of human-autonomy teams.
      It will be critical to decide how and in which contexts various agents should
      be utilized. Additionally, delineating the meaning of trust and ethical consideration
      between humans and machines is problematic because descriptions of trust and
      ethics have only been detailed in human terms. This means autonomous agents
      will be subject to anthropomorphism, but robots are not humans, and their experience
      of trust and ethics might be markedly distinct from humans. Ideally speaking,
      to fully entrust a machine with human-centered tasks, one must believe that
      such an entity is reliable, competent, has the appropriate priorities in decision-making,
      and can comprehend the consequences of actions taken. Such qualities may depend
      on conscious awareness\u2014but without first deciphering what consciousness
      is in the first place, humans may fail to accurately identify consciousness
      in machines.This work explores the foundations of consciousness from the perspective
      of evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers, and strives to
      position degrees of consciousness in a trust and ethical consideration framework
      to guide AI usage and research. To mitigate foreseeable risks in autonomy, the
      authors seek to spark dialogue and preventative action, so proper legal and
      operational requirements can be established prior to any agent acquiring even
      an inkling of consciousness. If implemented correctly, such measures may reduce
      the likelihood of unintentional damage and help to secure a future of continued
      collaboration and shared success between humans and machines.", "venue": "Symposium

      Two crucial enhancements come from the continuous couplings having strengths
      that are inherited from the fitness of the parents (so-called nepotism) and
      from the annealer couplings allowing the entire population to be influenced

      . Hardness of approximation (HA) \u2013 the phenomenon that, assuming P 6 =
      NP, one can easily compute an \u01eb -approximation to the solution of a discrete
      computational problem for \u01eb > \u01eb 0 > 0 , but for \u01eb < \u01eb 0
      it suddenly becomes intractable \u2013 is a core phenomenon in the foundations
      of computations that has transformed computer science. In this paper we study
      the newly discovered phenomenon in the foundations of computational mathematics:
      generalised hardness of approximation (GHA) \u2013 which in spirit is close
      to classical HA in computer science. However, GHA is typically independent of
      the P vs. NP question in many cases. Thus, it requires a new mathematical framework
      that we initiate in this paper. We demonstrate the hitherto undiscovered phenomenon
      that GHA happens when using AI techniques in order to train optimal neural networks
      (NNs). In particular, for any non-zero underdetermined linear problem the following
      phase transition may occur: One can prove the existence of optimal NNs for solving
      the problem but they can only be computed to a certain accuracy \u01eb 0 > 0
      . Below the approximation threshold \u01eb 0 \u2013 not only does it become
      intractable to compute the NN \u2013 it becomes impossible regardless of computing
      power, and no randomised algorithm can solve the problem with probability better
      than 1/2. In other cases, despite the existence of a stable optimal NN, any
      attempts of computing it below the approximation threshold \u01eb 0 will yield
      an unstable NN. Our results use and extend the current mathematical framework
      of the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy and facilitate a program
      for detecting the GHA phenomenon throughout computational mathematics and AI.",

      dialogue systems, the dialogue generation task has attracted increasing attention
      over the past few years. This task is usually formulated as a conditional generation
      problem, which aims to generate a natural and meaningful response given dialogue
      contexts and specific constraints, such as persona. And maintaining a consistent
      persona is essential for the dialogue systems to gain trust from the users.
      Although tremendous advancements have been brought, traditional persona-based
      dialogue models are typically trained by leveraging a large number of persona-dense
      dialogue examples. Yet, such persona-dense training data are expensive to obtain,
      leading to a limited scale. This work presents a novel approach to learning
      from limited training examples by regarding consistency understanding as a regularization
      of response generation. To this end, we propose a novel stack-propagation framework
      for learning a generation and understanding pipeline. Specifically, the framework
      stacks a Transformer encoder and two Transformer decoders, where the first decoder
      models response generation and the second serves as a regularizer and jointly
      models response generation and consistency understanding. The proposed framework
      can benefit from the stacked encoder and decoders to learn from much smaller
      personalized dialogue data while maintaining competitive performance. Under
      different low-resource settings, subjective and objective evaluations prove
      that the stack-propagation framework outperforms strong baselines in response
      quality and persona consistency and largely overcomes the shortcomings of traditional
      models that rely heavily on the persona-dense dialogue data.", "venue": "ACM

      gases emission from fossil fuels has attracted public concerns due to its worse
      effects on the ecosystem and living conditions not only mankind but also all
      creatures living on earth. That''s why solar energy has a vital role in alternative
      energy resources. Solar energy sources will gain more importance in the future.
      As it is known, the most needed type of energy today is electrical energy. Thus,
      in this study, the necessary conditions for the photovoltaic (PV) systems used
      in solar energy production to operate at maximum performance and which parameters
      are required to control these conditions are examined. The results show that
      four parameters that we need to measure. These are: maximum operating current
      of a panel/cell (Impp), maximum operating voltage of a panel/cell (Vmpp), panel
      surface temperature and light intensity falling on the panel. Except for the
      panel surface temperature, the rest of the parameters can be measured directly.
      However, affecting the panel surface temperature; we must not ignore parameters
      such as ambient temperature, wind speed, humidity and light intensity. Therefore,
      while determining the panel surface temperature, these parameters should also
      be measured and a surface temperature should be determined accordingly.", "venue":

      "To meet a growing demand for information processing, brain-inspired neuromorphic
      devices have been intensively studied in recent years. As an important type
      of neuromorphic device, synaptic devices have attracted strong attention. Among
      all the kinds of materials explored for the fabrication of synaptic devices,
      semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have become one of the preferred choices due
      to their excellent electronic and optical properties. In this review, we first
      introduce the research background of synaptic devices based on semiconductor
      NCs and briefly present the basic properties of semiconductor NCs. Recent developments
      in the field of synaptic devices based on semiconductor NCs are then discussed
      according to the materials employed in the active layers of the devices. Finally,
      we discuss existing problems and challenges of synaptic devices based on semiconductor

      "This paper questions the feasibility of a strong (general) data-centric artificial
      intelligence (AI). The disadvantages of this type of intelligence are discussed.
      As an alternative, the concept of co-evolutionary hybrid intelligence is proposed.
      It is based on the cognitive interoperability of man and machine. An analysis
      of existing approaches to the construction of cognitive architectures is given.
      An architecture seamlessly incorporates a human into the loop of intelligent
      problem solving is considered. The article is organized as follows. The first
      part contains a critique of data-centric intelligent systems. The reasons why
      it is impossible to create a strong artificial intelligence based on this type
      of intelligence are indicated. The second part briefly presents the concept
      of co-evolutionary hybrid intelligence and shows its advantages. The third part
      gives an overview and analysis of existing cognitive architectures. It is concluded
      that many do not consider humans part of the intelligent data processing process.
      The next part discusses the cognitive architecture for co-evolutionary hybrid
      intelligence, providing integration with humans. It finishes with general conclusions
      about the feasibility of developing intelligent systems with humans in the problem-solving
      loop.", "venue": "Artificial General Intelligence", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      Blockchain-based Data Evaluation Scheme", "abstract": "Blockchain and Deep Learning
      (DL) are two of the most revolutionary concepts in the field of Computer Science.
      Both have made astounding leaps in research and application areas such as Finance,
      Healthcare, Internet of Things, and many more. Federated Learning (FL) is a
      type of distributed Deep Learning framework, in which the model is trained locally
      on each device and the trained gradients are sent to a central server which
      aggregates them and creates a global model. This helps ensure the data privacy
      of the user as the data never leaves the local device. However, this dependency
      on the central server can lead to various issues such as lack of transparency
      and communication bottleneck. Making this process decentralized can help address
      these issues. In this review, a detailed survey on using blockchain in federated
      learning is presented. This review also focuses on how can we use blockchain
      to make federated learning more transparent and decentralized to protect the
      privacy of the user. We also discuss the major strengths and drawbacks of each
      approach and further present a few ideas of our own, regarding some of these
      challenges and ways on how can these be improved. A new scheme to evaluate data
      using miners as well as methods to reduce storage overhead in decentralized

      making and that the intervention of risk governance elements can effectively
      block the social risks arising from algorithmic, technological, and data risks.

      nanocomposites has been an area of high scientific and industrial attention
      due to noteworthy improvements attained in these materials, arising from the
      synergetic combination of properties of a polymeric matrix and an organic or
      inorganic nanomaterial. The enhanced performance of those materials typically
      involves superior mechanical strength, toughness and stiffness, electrical and
      thermal conductivity, better flame retardancy and a higher barrier to moisture
      and gases. Nanocomposites can also display unique design possibilities, which
      provide exceptional advantages in developing multifunctional materials with
      desired properties for specific applications. On the other hand, machine learning
      (ML) has been recognized as a powerful predictive tool for data-driven multi-physical
      modelling, leading to unprecedented insights and an exploration of the system\u2019s
      properties beyond the capability of traditional computational and experimental
      analyses. This article aims to provide a brief overview of the most important
      findings related to the application of ML for the rational design of polymeric
      nanocomposites. Prediction, optimization, feature identification and uncertainty
      quantification are presented along with different ML algorithms used in the

      stored in live organisms are constantly being refined. As the field of AI matures
      with more trained algorithms, the potential of its application in epidemiology,
      the study of host\u2013pathogen interactions and drug designing widens. AI is
      now being applied in several fields of drug discovery, customized medicine,

      farmers have reduced waste, increased output and decreased the amount of time
      it takes to bring their goods to market due to the application of advanced AI-based
      approaches. Moreover, with the use of AI through machine learning (ML) and deep-learning-based
      smart programs, one can modify the metabolic pathways of living systems to obtain
      the best possible outputs with the minimal inputs. Such efforts can improve

      Digital twins (DT) are simulation models that so closely replicate reality in
      their behaviour that experts may believe model output to be real. Plankton offer
      worthy yet tractable biological targets for digital twinning, due to their relatively
      simply physiology and significant role in ecology from theoretical studies through
      to planetary scale biogeochemistry. Construction of dynamic plankton DT (PDT),
      representing a supreme test of our understanding of plankton ecophysiology,
      would form the basis of education and training aids, provide platforms for hypothesis
      setting/testing, experiment design and interpretation, and support the construction
      and testing of large-scale ecosystem models and allied management tools. PDTs
      may be constructed using concepts from systems biology, with system dynamics,
      including feedback controls akin to biological (de)repression processes, to
      provide a robust approach to model plankton, with flexible core features enabling
      ready and meaningful configuration of phenotypic traits. Expert witness validation
      through Turing Tests would provide confidence in the end product. Through deployment
      of PDTs with appropriate input controls and output (visualization) tools, empiricists
      are more likely to engage with modelling, enhancing future science and increasing
      confidence in predictive operational and also in long-term climate simulations.",

      authors analyzed a sample of 251 HRPs from 11 different countries divided into
      4 cultural clusters to explore their attitude to incorporate new practices to
      the HR field because of technological development. The paper explores HRPs''
      beliefs in a legal and financial context, performance management issues, and
      the impact of automation on the decision-making process. Furthermore, the authors
      perform a cross-cultural comparison analysis to examine potential significant

      adoption is affecting work environment and they highlight the importance of
      human resources (HR) for businesses, despite the global trend of extensive machinery
      exploitation. Interestingly, our results suggest that overall globalization,

      with how networked, AI-enhanced digital technologies extend and intermesh with
      human beings cognitively, affectively, morally, corporeally, spatially, temporally,
      socially and politically. We catalogued Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies
      that have been deployed in some of today\u2019s K-12 classrooms (AIEDK-12)s

      illustrate its use to compare how well different language models are able to
      reproduce classic economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology experiments:
      Ultimatum Game, Garden Path Sentences, Milgram Shock Experiment, and Wisdom
      of Crowds. In the first three TEs, the existing findings were replicated using
      recent models, while the last TE reveals a\"hyper-accuracy distortion\"present
      in some language models (including ChatGPT and GPT-4), which could affect downstream
      applications in education and the arts.", "venue": "International Conference

      have long been benchmarks and test-beds for AI algorithms. With the development
      of AI techniques and the boost of computational power, modern game AI systems
      have achieved superhuman performance in many games played by humans. These games
      have various features and present different challenges to AI research, so the
      algorithms used in each of these AI systems vary. This survey aims to give a
      systematic review of the techniques and paradigms used in modern game AI systems.
      By decomposing each of the recent milestones into basic components and comparing
      them based on the features of games, we summarize the common paradigms to build
      game AI systems and their scope and limitations. We claim that deep reinforcement
      learning is the most general methodology to become a mainstream method for games
      with higher complexity. We hope this survey can both provide a review of game
      AI algorithms and bring inspiration to the game AI community for future directions.",

      "title": "Dermatopathology of Malignant Melanoma in the Era of Artificial Intelligence:
      A Single Institutional Experience", "abstract": "The application of artificial
      intelligence (AI) algorithms in medicine could support diagnostic and prognostic
      analyses and decision making. In the field of dermatopathology, there have been
      various papers that have trained algorithms for the recognition of different
      types of skin lesions, such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), seborrheic keratosis
      (SK) and dermal nevus. Furthermore, the difficulty in diagnosing particular
      melanocytic lesions, such as Spitz nevi and melanoma, considering the grade
      of interobserver variability among dermatopathologists, has led to an objective
      difficulty in training machine learning (ML) algorithms to a totally reliable,
      reportable and repeatable level. In this work we tried to train a fast random
      forest (FRF) algorithm, typically used for the classification of clusters of
      pixels in images, to highlight anomalous areas classified as melanoma \u201cdefects\u201d
      following the Allen\u2013Spitz criteria. The adopted image vision diagnostic
      protocol was structured in the following steps: image acquisition by selecting
      the best zoom level of the microscope; preliminary selection of an image with
      a good resolution; preliminary identification of macro-areas of defect in each
      preselected image; identification of a class of a defect in the selected macro-area;
      training of the supervised machine learning FRF algorithm by selecting the micro-defect
      in the macro-area; execution of the FRF algorithm to find an image vision performance
      indicator; and analysis of the output images by enhancing lesion defects. The
      precision achieved by the FRF algorithm proved to be appropriate with a discordance
      of 17% with respect to the dermatopathologist, allowing this type of supervised
      algorithm to be nominated as a help to the dermatopathologist in the challenging
      diagnosis of malignant melanoma.", "venue": "Diagnostics", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      "Abstract How would human players negotiate a spatial array with a randomly
      behaving partner? In an interactive, online, zero-sum grid game, we tested whether
      and how players create areas and place sequences by coloring-in places in a
      20\u2009\u00d7\u200920 matrix (261 human adults, 261 machine partners, N\u2009=\u2009522).
      Several indicators showed that human players followed an intentional strategy
      rather than coloring in places ad libitum. First, human players built a larger
      largest cluster from places than the machine. Second, they were sensitive to
      task instructions and could modify their strategy accordingly. When instructed
      to build an area, they built a bigger one. When set under time pressure, they
      colored-in faster and only had time to build a smaller cluster from places.
      Third, the most compelling human strategy to create an area was lining up pathways
      (place sequencing). Despite these differences, the resulting spatial field structure
      was similar in human and machine players.", "venue": "International journal

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) alongside one of its main subsets, machine learning

      AI/ML has found practical applications in finance; whether it is generating

      Through the Lens of Art and Music", "abstract": "Abstract Dualisms are pervasive.
      The divisions between the rational mind, the physical body, and the external
      natural world have set the stage for the successes and failures of contemporary
      cognitive science and artificial intelligence.1 Advanced machine learning (ML)
      and artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been developed to draw art and
      compose music. Many take these facts as calls for a radical shift in our values
      and turn to questions about AI ethics, rights, and personhood. While the discussion
      of agency and rights is not wrong in principle, it is a form of misdirection
      in the current circumstances. Questions about an artificial agency can only
      come after a genuine reconciliation of human interactivity, creativity, and
      embodiment. This kind of challenge has both moral and theoretical force. In
      this article, the authors intend to contribute to embodied and enactive approaches
      to AI by exploring the interactive and contingent dimensions of machines through

      intelligence (AI) is a modern approach based on computer science that develops
      programs and algorithms to make devices intelligent and efficient for performing
      tasks that usually require skilled human intelligence. AI involves various subsets,
      including machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), conventional neural networks,
      fuzzy logic, and speech recognition, with unique capabilities and functionalities
      that can improve the performances of modern medical sciences. Such intelligent
      systems simplify human intervention in clinical diagnosis, medical imaging,
      and decision-making ability. In the same era, the Internet of Medical Things
      (IoMT) emerges as a next-generation bio-analytical tool that combines network-linked
      biomedical devices with a software application for advancing human health. In
      this review, we discuss the importance of AI in improving the capabilities of
      IoMT and point-of-care (POC) devices used in advanced healthcare sectors such
      as cardiac measurement, cancer diagnosis, and diabetes management. The role
      of AI in supporting advanced robotic surgeries developed for advanced biomedical
      applications is also discussed in this article. The position and importance
      of AI in improving the functionality, detection accuracy, decision-making ability
      of IoMT devices, and evaluation of associated risks assessment is discussed
      carefully and critically in this review. This review also encompasses the technological
      and engineering challenges and prospects for AI-based cloud-integrated personalized

      open problems each of which is estimated to require one million dollars of investment
      or more. They are (1) the image annotation problem (e.g., retina is without
      bounding box to learn, unlike ImageNet), (2) the sensorimotor recurrence problem
      (e.g., all big data sets are invalid), (3) the motor-supervision problem (e.g.,
      impractical to supervise motors throughout lifetime), (4) the sensor calibration
      problem (e.g., a life calibrates the eyes automatically), (5) the inverse kinematics
      problem (e.g., a life calibrates all redundant limbs automatically), (6) the
      government-free problem (i.e., no task-aware homunculus inside a brain), (7)
      the closed-skull problem (e.g., supervising hidden neurons is biologically implausible),
      (8) the nonlinear controller problem (e.g., a brain is a nonlinear controller
      but task-nonspecific), (9) the curse of dimensionality problem (e.g., a set
      of global features is insufficient for a life), (10) the under-sample problem
      (i.e., few available examples in a life), (11) the distributed vs. local representations
      problem (i.e., how both representations emerge), (12) the symbol problem (also
      called grounding problem, thus must be free from any symbols), (13) the local
      minima problem (so, avoid error-backprop learning and Post-Selections), (14)
      the abstraction problem (i.e., require various invariances and transfers), (15)
      the compositionality problem (e.g., metonymy beyond those composable from sentences),
      (16) the smooth representations problem (e.g., brain representations are globally
      smooth), (17) the motivation problem (e.g., including reinforcements and various
      emotions), (18) the global optimality problem (e.g., avoid catastrophic memory
      loss and Post-Selections), (19) the auto-programming for general purposes (APFGP)

      "title": "Domain Infused Conversational Response Generation for Tutoring based
      Virtual Agent", "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning typically, with
      the introduction of transformer based models has shown massive improvement and
      success in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. One such area which
      has leveraged immensely is conversational agents or chatbots in open-ended (chit-chat
      conversations) and task-specific (such as medical or legal dialogue bots etc.)
      domains. However, in the era of automation, there is still a dearth of works
      focused on one of the most relevant use cases, i.e., tutoring dialog systems
      that can help students learn new subjects or topics of their interest. Most
      of the previous works in this domain are either rule based systems which require
      a lot of manual efforts or are based on multiple choice type factual questions.
      In this paper, we propose EDICA (Educational Domain Infused Conversational Agent),
      a language tutoring Virtual Agent (VA). EDICA employs two mechanisms in order
      to converse fluently with a student/user over a question and assist them to
      learn a language: (i) Student/Tutor Intent Classification (SIC-TIC) framework
      to identify the intent of the student and decide the action of the VA, respectively,
      in the on-going conversation and (ii) Tutor Response Generation (TRG) framework
      to generate domain infused and intent/action conditioned tutor responses at
      every step of the conversation. The VA is able to provide hints, ask questions
      and correct student''s reply by generating an appropriate, informative and relevant
      tutor response. We establish the superiority of our proposed approach on various
      evaluation metrics over other baselines and state of the art models.", "venue":

      "title": "Self-organized criticality as a framework for consciousness: A review
      study", "abstract": "Objective No current model of consciousness is univocally
      accepted on either theoretical or empirical grounds, and the need for a solid
      unifying framework is evident. Special attention has been given to the premise
      that self-organized criticality (SOC) is a fundamental property of neural system.
      SOC provides a competitive model to describe the physical mechanisms underlying
      spontaneous brain activity, and thus, critical dynamics were proposed as general
      gauges of information processing representing a strong candidate for a surrogate
      measure of consciousness. As SOC could be a neurodynamical framework, which
      may be able to bring together existing theories and experimental evidence, the
      purpose of this work was to provide a comprehensive overview of progress of
      research on SOC in association with consciousness. Methods A comprehensive search
      of publications on consciousness and SOC published between 1998 and 2021 was
      conducted. The Web of Science database was searched, and annual number of publications
      and citations, type of articles, and applied methods were determined. Results
      A total of 71 publications were identified. The annual number of citations steadily
      increased over the years. Original articles comprised 50.7% and reviews/theoretical
      articles 43.6%. Sixteen studies reported on human data and in seven studies
      data were recorded in animals. Computational models were utilized in n\u2009=\u200912
      studies. EcoG data were assessed in n\u2009=\u20094 articles, fMRI in n\u2009=\u20094
      studies, and EEG/MEG in n\u2009=\u200910 studies. Notably, different analytical
      tools were applied in the EEG/MEG studies to assess a surrogate measure of criticality
      such as the detrended fluctuation analysis, the pair correlation function, parameters
      from the neuronal avalanche analysis and the spectral exponent. Conclusion Recent
      studies pointed out agreements of critical dynamics with the current most influencing
      theories in the field of consciousness research, the global workspace theory
      and the integrated information theory. Thus, the framework of SOC as a neurodynamical
      parameter for consciousness seems promising. However, identified experimental
      work was small in numbers, and a heterogeneity of applied analytical tools as
      a surrogate measure of criticality was observable, which limits the generalizability
      of findings.", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, which was caused by the severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a significant
      loss of human life around the world. The SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant problems
      to medical systems and healthcare facilities due to its unexpected global expansion.
      Despite all of the efforts, developing effective treatments, diagnostic techniques,
      and vaccinations for this unique virus is a top priority and takes a long time.
      However, the foremost step in vaccine development is to identify possible antigens
      for a vaccine. The traditional method was time taking, but after the breakthrough
      technology of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in 2000, it drastically
      lowers the time needed to detect antigens ranging from 5\u201315 years to 1\u20132
      years. The different RV tools work based on machine learning (ML) and artificial
      intelligence (AI). Models based on AI and ML have shown promising solutions
      in accelerating the discovery and optimization of new antivirals or effective
      vaccine candidates. In the present scenario, AI has been extensively used for
      drug and vaccine research against SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery. This is more
      useful for the identification of potential existing drugs with inhibitory human
      coronavirus by using different datasets. The AI tools and computational approaches
      have led to speedy research and the development of a vaccine to fight against
      the coronavirus. Therefore, this paper suggests the role of artificial intelligence
      in the field of clinical trials of vaccines and clinical practices using different
      tools.", "venue": "BioMed Research International", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      "Humans and robots operating in unstructured environments both need to classify
      objects through haptic exploration and use them in various tasks, but currently
      they differ greatly in their strategies for acquiring such capabilities. This
      review explores nascent technologies that promise more convergence. A novel
      form of artificial intelligence classifies objects according to sensory percepts
      during active exploration and decides on efficient sequences of exploratory
      actions to identify objects. Representing objects according to the collective
      experience of manipulating them provides a substrate for discovering causality
      and affordances. Such concepts that generalize beyond explicit training experiences
      are an important aspect of human intelligence that has eluded robots. For robots
      to acquire such knowledge, they will need an extended period of active exploration
      and manipulation similar to that employed by infants. The efficacy, efficiency
      and safety of such behaviors depends on achieving smooth transitions between
      movements that change quickly from exploratory to executive to reflexive. Animals
      achieve such smoothness by using a hierarchical control scheme that is fundamentally
      different from those of conventional robotics. The lowest level of that hierarchy,
      the spinal cord, starts to self-organize during spontaneous movements in the
      fetus. This allows its connectivity to reflect the mechanics of the musculoskeletal
      plant, a bio-inspired process that could be used to adapt spinal-like middleware
      for robots. Implementation of these extended and essential stages of fetal and
      infant development is impractical, however, for mechatronic hardware that does
      not heal and replace itself like biological tissues. Instead such development
      can now be accomplished in silico and then cloned into physical robots, a strategy
      that could transcend human performance.", "venue": "Frontiers in Robotics and

      priority for the EU Cyber Agenda to build free and safe, yet resilient cyberspace.
      In a traditional regulatory fashion, the EU has therefore sought to gain more
      control over third country-based digital intermediaries through legislative
      solutions regulating its internal market. Although potentially effective in
      shielding EU citizens from data exploitation by internet giants, this protectionist
      strategy tells us little about the EU\u2019s ability to develop Digital Sovereignty,
      beyond its capacity to react to the external tech industry. Given the growing
      hybridisation of warfare, building on the increasing integration of artificial
      intelligence (AI) in the security domain, leadership in advancing AI-related
      technology has a significant impact on countries\u2019 defence capacity. By
      framing AI as the intrinsic functioning of algorithms, data mining and computational
      capacity, we question what tools the EU could rely on to gain sovereignty in
      each of these dimensions of AI. By focusing on AI from an EU Foreign Policy
      perspective, we conclude that contrary to the growing narrative, given the absence
      of a leading AI industry and a coherent defence strategy, the EU has few tools
      to become a global leader in advancing standards of AI beyond its regulatory
      capacity.", "venue": "European Security", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 122,

      "title": "The paradox of denial and mystification of machine intelligence in
      the Chinese room", "abstract": "Two critical questions spun the web of the Turing
      test debate. First, can an appropriately programmed machine pass the Turing
      test? Second, is passing the test by such a machine, ipso facto, considered
      proof that it is intelligent and hence \u201cminded\u201d? While the first question
      is technological, the second is purely philosophical. Focusing on the second
      question, this article interrogates the implication of John Searle\u2019s Chinese
      room denial of machine intelligence. The thrust of Searle\u2019s argument is
      that a machine lacks intentionality, so it can only simulate intelligence, not
      duplicate it. In his thinking, whatever a machine inputs to generate an intelligent
      output has no bearing on humanlike intelligence. Incidentally, Searle did not
      classify such a machine\u2019s output as simulated and non-intelligent, nor
      did he explain how this output is actualised with mere simulation. The connection
      between \u201cunintelligent machine\u2019s input\u201d and \u201cintelligent
      machine\u2019s output\u201d is at this point shrouded in mystery. Consequently,
      the more Searle attempts a denial of machine intelligence in the Chinese room,
      the more he mystifies it. Using the method of critical analysis, this article
      advances three fundamental arguments to prove a machines\u2019 obscurity in
      the Chinese room thought experiment. On the ground of Searle\u2019s conviction,
      the first argument queries the absurdity in bypassing intentionality to produce
      intelligence; the second points out the obfuscation in generating intelligence
      with mere computation, and the third draws attention to the dilemma of classifying
      a machine\u2019s output either as real-life intelligent behaviour or simulated
      intelligent behaviour.", "venue": "South African Journal of Philosophy", "year":

      imitation game, nor augmented intelligence built to maximize the human manipulation
      of information are tuned to accelerate innovation and improve humanity\u2019s
      collective advance against its greatest challenges. We reconceptualize and pilot
      beneficial AI to radically augment human understanding by complementing rather
      than competing with human cognitive capacity. Our approach to complementary
      intelligence builds on insights underlying the wisdom of crowds, which hinges
      on the independence and diversity of crowd members\u2019 information and approach.
      By programmatically incorporating information on the evolving distribution of
      scientific expertise from research papers, our approach follows the distribution
      of content in the literature while avoiding the scientific crowd and the hypotheses
      cognitively available to it. We use this approach to generate valuable predictions
      for what materials possess valuable energy-related properties (e.g., thermoelectricity),
      and what compounds possess valuable medical properties (e.g., asthma) that complement
      the human scientific crowd. We demonstrate that our complementary predictions,
      if identified by human scientists and inventors at all, are only discovered
      years further into the future. When we evaluate the promise of our predictions
      with first-principles or data-driven simulations of those properties, we demonstrate
      an \u201cexpectation gap\u201d such that increased complementarity of our predictions
      do not decrease and in some cases increase the probability of these properties
      above those discovered and published by human scientists. In summary, by tuning
      AI to avoid the crowd, we can generate hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or
      pursued without intervention until the distant future that promise to punctuate
      scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias,
      these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by reformulating
      science education for discovery.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      "abstract": "Language-based interaction with pervasive devices today mostly
      follows a basic command-and-control paradigm, reminiscent of 1960s Star Trek,
      which is often cumbersome, inadequate, and insufficient. Key causes include
      an often deceptive portrayal of the language comprehension capabilities of the
      system and, in many cases, a problematic impersonation of human characters by
      computers. We argue here that a major challenge of pervasive computing is to
      rethink language-based interaction with applications and devices. Inspired by
      the imaginary pervasive conversations of Sci-Fi movies, we suggest a new design
      principle where machines should only utter statements that they can comprehend,
      which we call What You Hear Is What You Say (WYHIWYS). We provide some examples
      of WYHIWYS in language interactions with pervasive applications, including a
      deployment in an art exhibit, and discuss some key research challenges it poses
      to HCI, AI, and pervasive computing.", "venue": "IEEE pervasive computing",

      detecting retinopathy of prematurity: A systematic review", "abstract": "PURPOSE:
      Artificial intelligence (AI) offers considerable promise for retinopathy of
      prematurity (ROP) screening and diagnosis. The development of deep-learning
      algorithms to detect the presence of disease may contribute to sufficient screening,
      early detection, and timely treatment for this preventable blinding disease.
      This review aimed to systematically examine the literature in AI algorithms
      in detecting ROP. Specifically, we focused on the performance of deep-learning
      algorithms through sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating
      curve (AUROC) for both the detection and grade of ROP. METHODS: We searched
      Medline OVID, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for studies published from
      January 1, 2012, to September 20, 2021. Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance
      of deep-learning models based on retinal fundus images with expert ophthalmologists''
      judgment as reference standard were included. Studies which did not investigate
      the presence or absence of disease were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed
      using the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: Twelve studies out of the 175 studies identified
      were included. Five studies measured the performance of detecting the presence
      of ROP and seven studies determined the presence of plus disease. The average
      AUROC out of 11 studies was 0.98. The average sensitivity and specificity for
      detecting ROP was 95.72% and 98.15%, respectively, and for detecting plus disease
      was 91.13% and 95.92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance
      of deep-learning algorithms in published studies was high. Few studies presented
      externally validated results or compared performance to expert human graders.
      Large scale prospective validation alongside robust study design could improve
      future studies.", "venue": "Saudi Journal of Ophthalmology", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      "title": "A Static and Dynamic Attention Framework for Multi Turn Dialogue Generation",
      "abstract": "Recently, research on open domain dialogue systems have attracted
      extensive interests of academic and industrial researchers. The goal of an open
      domain dialogue system is to imitate humans in conversations. Previous works
      on single turn conversation generation have greatly promoted the research of
      open domain dialogue systems. However, understanding multiple single turn conversations
      is not equal to the understanding of multi turn dialogue due to the coherent
      and context dependent properties of human dialogue. Therefore, in open domain
      multi turn dialogue generation, it is essential to modeling the contextual semantics
      of the dialogue history rather than only according to the last utterance. Previous
      research had verified the effectiveness of the hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder
      framework on open domain multi turn dialogue generation. However, using an RNN-based
      model to hierarchically encoding the utterances to obtain the representation
      of dialogue history still face the problem of a vanishing gradient. To address
      this issue, in this article, we proposed a static and dynamic attention-based
      approach to model the dialogue history and then generate open domain multi turn
      dialogue responses. Experimental results on the Ubuntu and Opensubtitles datasets
      verify the effectiveness of the proposed static and dynamic attention-based
      approach on automatic and human evaluation metrics in various experimental settings.
      Meanwhile, we also empirically verify the performance of combining the static
      and dynamic attentions on open domain multi turn dialogue generation.", "venue":

      "title": "Investigating visual expertise in sculpture: A methodological approach
      using eye tracking", "abstract": "Research on visual expertise has progressed
      significantly due to the availability of eye tracking tools. However, attempts
      to bring together research on expertise and eye tracking methodology provoke
      several challenges, because visual information processes should be studied in
      authentic and domain-specific environments. Among the barriers to designing
      appropriate research are the proper definition of levels of expertise, the tension
      between internal (experimental control) and external (authentic environments)
      validity, and the appropriate methodology to study eye movements in a three-dimensional
      environment. This exploratory study aims to address these challenges and to
      provide an adequate research setting by investigating visual expertise in sculpting.
      Eye movements and gaze patterns of 20 participants were investigated while looking
      at two sculptures in a museum. The participants were assigned to four different
      groups based on their level of expertise (laypersons, novices, semi-experts,
      experts). Using mobile eye tracking, the following parameters were measured:
      number of fixations, duration of fixation, dwell time in relevant areas, and
      revisits in relevant areas. Moreover, scan paths were analysed using the eyenalysis
      approach. Conclusions are drawn on both the nature of visual expertise in sculpting
      and the potential (and limitations) of empirical designs that aim to investigate
      expertise in authentic environments.", "venue": "Journal of Eye Movement Research",

      Language Barriers", "abstract": "Conceptual representations of meaning have
      long been the general focus of Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the fundamental
      goal of machine understanding, with innumerable efforts made in Knowledge Representation,
      Speech and Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, inter alia. Even today,
      at the core of Natural Language Understanding lies the task of Semantic Parsing,
      the objective of which is to convert natural sentences into machine-readable
      representations. Through this paper, we aim to revamp the historical dream of
      AI, by putting forward a novel, all-embracing, fully semantic meaning representation,
      that goes beyond the many existing formalisms. Indeed, we tackle their key limits
      by fully abstracting text into meaning and introducing language-independent
      concepts and semantic relations, in order to obtain an interlingual representation.
      Our proposal aims to overcome the language barrier, and connect not only texts
      across languages, but also images, videos, speech and sound, and logical formulas,
      across many fields of AI.", "venue": "AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence",

      "The Turing test for comparing computer performance to that of humans is well
      known, but, surprisingly, there is no widely used test for comparing how much
      better human-computer systems perform relative to humans alone, computers alone,
      or other baselines. Here, we show how to perform such a test using the ratio
      of means as a measure of effect size. Then we demonstrate the use of this test
      in three ways. First, in an analysis of 79 recently published experimental results,
      we \ufb01nd that, surprisingly, over half of the studies \ufb01nd a decrease
      in performance, the mean and median ratios of performance improvement are both
      approximately 1 (corresponding to no improvement at all), and the maximum ratio
      is 1.36 (a 36% improvement). Second, we experimentally investigate whether a
      higher performance improvement ratio is obtained when 100 human programmers
      generate software using GPT-3, a massive, state-of-the-art AI system. In this
      case, we \ufb01nd a speed improvement ratio of 1.27 (a 27% improvement). Finally,
      we \ufb01nd that 50 human non- programmers using GPT-3 can perform the task
      about as well as\u2013and less expensively than\u2013the human programmers.
      In this case, neither the non-programmers nor the computer would have been able
      to perform the task alone, so this is an example of a very strong form of human-computer
      synergy. stimulate competition among teams of computer and social scientists
      developing human-computer systems that perform far better than either people
      or computers alone. We believe this could bene\ufb01t our economy and society
      by fostering the development of software to augment humans rather than just
      replace them. And in the long run, it might also lead to creating \u201csuperintelligent\u201d

      the Brain", "abstract": "Much of current artificial intelligence (AI) and the
      drive toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) focuses on developing machines
      for functional tasks that humans accomplish. These may be narrowly specified
      tasks as in AI, or more general tasks as in AGI \u2013 but typically these tasks
      do not target higher-level human cognitive abilities, such as consciousness
      or morality; these are left to the realm of so-called \u201cstrong AI\u201d
      or \u201cartificial consciousness.\u201d In this paper, we focus on how a machine
      can augment humans rather than do what they do, and we extend this beyond AGI-style
      tasks to augmenting peculiarly personal human capacities, such as wellbeing
      and morality. We base this proposal on associating such capacities with the
      \u201cself,\u201d which we define as the \u201cenvironment-agent nexus\u201d;
      namely, a fine-tuned interaction of brain with environment in all its relevant
      variables. We consider richly adaptive architectures that have the potential
      to implement this interaction by taking lessons from the brain. In particular,
      we suggest conjoining the free energy principle (FEP) with the dynamic temporo-spatial
      (TSD) view of neuro-mental processes. Our proposed integration of FEP and TSD
      \u2013 in the implementation of artificial agents \u2013 offers a novel, expressive,
      and explainable way for artificial agents to adapt to different environmental
      contexts. The targeted applications are broad: from adaptive intelligence augmenting
      agents (IA\u2019s) that assist psychiatric self-regulation to environmental
      disaster prediction and personal assistants. This reflects the central role
      of the mind and moral decision-making in most of what we do as humans.", "venue":

      In this paper, I challenge that assumption by providing strong mathematical
      arguments against the Church-Turing thesis. First, I show that there are decision
      problems that are computable for humans, but uncomputable for Turing Machines.
      Next, using a thought experiment I show that a humanoid robot equipped with
      a Turing Machine as the control unit cannot perform all humanly doable physical
      tasks. Finally, I show that a quantum mechanical computing device involving
      sequential quantum wave function collapse can compute sequences that are uncomputable

      to the conclusion that the human mind cannot be simulated by a Turing Machine.

      "abstract": "On December 8th, 2021, Professor Stuart Russell delivered the second
      of that year\u2019s Reith Lectures, presented under the banner title \u2018Living
      With Artificial Intelligence\u2019. This specific talk dealt with \u2018The
      Future Role of AI in Warfare\u2019, and in this paper I propose a reading of
      Russell\u2019s address which both summarises and critiques his argument and
      stance, to determine what, if anything, can be taken from his position as effectively
      a public philosopher and applied in the realm of modern warfare, where ethical
      questions are taken from the seminar room and enacted in battlespace. The Reith
      lectures occupy a unique place in public discourse; given each year by a leading
      figure in the field under discussion, they help to shape opinion and debate.
      In considering the role of AI, and in particular its deployment in combat, there
      is undoubtedly a need for multi- and transdisciplinary thought, but the choice
      of Russell as the lecturer is not unproblematic. He is undoubtedly an expert
      in the field of AI, but he has no direct experience of working with the military,
      and is clearly not a neutral witness. He has been a leading figure in the campaign
      to ban research into autonomous weapon systems, and was closely involved in
      the production of Slaughterbots, a short film which presents a nightmare vision
      of swarming drones as agents of political repression. There are deep and serious
      questions to be asked about the role of AI in warfare, but Russell\u2019s position
      that we must stop all research in the field is arguably na\u00efve. Our adversaries
      will surely not be as punctilious. At the heart of the debate lie complex issues
      concerning human agency and control (and \u2018control\u2019 lies at the etymological
      root of \u2018cyber\u2019); this paper will use Russell\u2019s lecture as a
      starting point for the consideration of how we might develop an ethical doctrine
      for the use of AI, resting on the idea of human-machine teaming. It will, in
      short, argue for a cybernetic solution to the problems of cyber warfare.", "venue":

      task is framed as a binary classification problem. The second task is a multi-class
      classification problem. We provide count-based and BERT-based baselines, along
      with the human evaluation on the first sub-task. A total of 30 and 8 systems

      artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved human-scale speed and accuracy for
      classification tasks. Current systems do not need to be conscious to recognize
      patterns and classify them. However, for AI to advance to the next level, it
      needs to develop capabilities such as metathinking, creativity, and empathy.
      We contend that such a paradigm shift is possible through a fundamental change
      in the state of artificial intelligence toward consciousness, similar to what
      took place for humans through the process of natural selection and evolution.
      To that end, we propose that consciousness in AI is an emergent phenomenon that
      primordially appears when two machines cocreate their own language through which
      they can recall and communicate their internal state of time-varying symbol
      manipulation. Because, in our view, consciousness arises from the communication
      of inner states, it leads to empathy. We then provide a link between the empathic
      quality of machines and better service outcomes associated with empathic human
      agents that can also lead to accountability in AI services. Graphical Abstract",

      "abstract": "The nature of education and training have dramatically changed
      due in large part to the advancement of technology. These advancements require
      changes in the skillsets of the learner. Research and history have shown that
      continuing to hire talents to fill gaps of knowledge and ad-hoc fixes are not
      typically enough to keep up with rapid innovation and change. This conceptual
      paper provides an innovative conceptualization of how to capitalize on the value
      of emerging AI technologies for education and training. We propose a holistic
      approach to augment AI and human capabilities in a competency-based learning
      environment. We argue that to successfully create an AI-based augmented training
      system, the fit between the learning task and the AI technology as well as the
      human-AI augmentation must be considered. These areas are explained in the specific
      context of competency-based learning.", "venue": "SIGMIS-CPR", "year": 2022,

      of life is its capacity to handle novelty and namely to thrive and adapt to
      new circumstances and changes in both the environment and internal components.
      An understanding of this capacity is central to several fields: the evolution
      of form and function, the design of effective strategies for biomedicine, and
      the creation of novel life forms via chimeric and bioengineering technologies.
      Here, we review instructive examples of living organisms solving diverse problems
      and propose competent navigation in arbitrary spaces as an invariant for thinking
      about the scaling of cognition during evolution. We argue that our innate capacity
      to recognize agency and intelligence in unfamiliar guises lags far behind our
      ability to detect it in familiar behavioral contexts. The multi-scale competency
      of life is essential to adaptive function, potentiating evolution and providing
      strategies for top-down control (not micromanagement) to address complex disease
      and injury. We propose an observer-focused viewpoint that is agnostic about
      scale and implementation, illustrating how evolution pivoted similar strategies
      to explore and exploit metabolic, transcriptional, morphological, and finally
      3D motion spaces. By generalizing the concept of behavior, we gain novel perspectives
      on evolution, strategies for system-level biomedical interventions, and the
      construction of bioengineered intelligences. This framework is a first step
      toward relating to intelligence in highly unfamiliar embodiments, which will

      of the Idea of Knowledge\n\nThe article presents the current state of development
      of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology, in particular the GPT-3
      language model, and presents its consequences for understanding the phenomenon
      of knowledge. The NLP technology has been experiencing remarkable development
      recently. The GPT-3 language model presents a level of advancement that allows
      it to generate texts as answers to general questions, as summaries of the presented
      text, etc., which reach the level surpassing the analogous level of human texts.
      These algorithmic operations lead to the determination of the probability distribution
      of its components. Texts generated by such a model should be considered as autonomous
      texts, using immanent, implicit knowledge embedded in language. This conclusion
      raises questions about the status of such knowledge. Help in the analysis is
      provided also by the theory of discourse, as well as the theory of discursive
      space based on it, that proposes the interpretation of knowledge as a trajectory

      \u201cCan a machine think?\u201d is sliding towards a more controversial issue:
      \u201cCan a machine be conscious?\u201d Of course, the two issues are linked.
      It is held here that consciousness is a pre-requisite to thought. In Turing\u2019s
      imitation game, a conscious human player is replaced by a machine, which, in
      the first place, is assumed not to be conscious, and which may fool an interlocutor,
      as consciousness cannot be perceived from an individual\u2019s speech or action.
      Here, the developing paradigm of machine consciousness is examined and combined
      with an extant analysis of living consciousness to argue that a conscious machine
      is feasible, and capable of thinking. The route to this utilizes learning in
      a \u201cneural state machine\u201d, which brings into play Turing\u2019s view
      of neural \u201cunorganized\u201d machines. The conclusion is that a machine

      system is an essential part of the smart customer service system. KBQA is a
      type of QA (Question Answering) system based on KB (Knowledge Base). It aims
      to automatically answer natural language questions by retrieving structured
      data stored in the knowledge base. Generally, when a KBQA system receives the
      user\u2019s query, it first needs to recognize topic entities of the query,
      such as name, location, organization, etc. This process is the NER (Named Entity
      Recognition). In this paper, we use the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional
      Random Field (Bi-LSTM-CRF) model and introduce the SoftLexicon method for a
      Chinese NER task. At the same time, according to the analysis of the characteristics
      of application scenario, we propose a fuzzy matching module based on the combination
      of multiple methods. This module can efficiently modify the error recognition
      results, which can further improve the performance of entity recognition. We
      combine the NER model and the fuzzy matching module into an NER system. To explore
      the availability of the system in some specific fields, such as a power grid
      field, we utilize the power grid-related original data collected by the Hebei
      Electric Power Company to improve our system according to the characteristics
      of data in the power grid field. We innovatively make the dataset and high-frequency
      word lexicon in the power grid field, which makes our proposed NER system perform
      better in recognizing entities in the field of power grid. We used the cross-validation
      method for validation. The experimental results show that the F1-score of the
      improved NER model on the power grid dataset reaches 92.43%. After processing
      the recognition results by using the fuzzy matching module, about 99% of the
      entities in the test set can be correctly recognized. It proves that the proposed
      NER system can achieve excellent performance in the application scenario of
      a power grid. The results of this work will also fill the gap in the research
      of intelligent customer-service-related technologies in the power grid field

      "title": "Evaluating Multimodal Interactive Agents", "abstract": "Creating agents
      that can interact naturally with humans is a common goal in artificial intelligence
      (AI) research. However, evaluating these interactions is challenging: collecting
      online human-agent interactions is slow and expensive, yet faster proxy metrics
      often do not correlate well with interactive evaluation. In this paper, we assess
      the merits of these existing evaluation metrics and present a novel approach
      to evaluation called the Standardised Test Suite (STS). The STS uses behavioural
      scenarios mined from real human interaction data. Agents see replayed scenario
      context, receive an instruction, and are then given control to complete the
      interaction offline. These agent continuations are recorded and sent to human
      annotators to mark as success or failure, and agents are ranked according to
      the proportion of continuations in which they succeed. The resulting STS is
      fast, controlled, interpretable, and representative of naturalistic interactions.
      Altogether, the STS consolidates much of what is desirable across many of our
      standard evaluation metrics, allowing us to accelerate research progress towards
      producing agents that can interact naturally with humans. A video may be found

      rise of AI systems in real-world applications comes the need for reliable and
      trustworthy AI. An essential aspect of this are explainable AI systems. However,
      there is no agreed standard on how explainable AI systems should be assessed.
      Inspired by the Turing test, we introduce a human-centric assessment framework
      where a leading domain expert accepts or rejects the solutions of an AI system
      and another domain expert. By comparing the acceptance rates of provided solutions,
      we can assess how the AI system performs compared to the domain expert, and
      whether the AI system''s explanations (if provided) are human-understandable.
      This setup -- comparable to the Turing test -- can serve as a framework for
      a wide range of human-centric AI system assessments. We demonstrate this by
      presenting two instantiations: (1) an assessment that measures the classification
      accuracy of a system with the option to incorporate label uncertainties; (2)
      an assessment where the usefulness of provided explanations is determined in
      a human-centric manner.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      "title": "A blueprint for conscious machines", "abstract": "Although it has
      been the subject of human thought for many centuries, consciousness remains
      a mysterious and controversial topic. Every one of us is overly familiar with
      the phenomenon, but there is little agreement on what it is, what it entails,
      and how it is created. Certainly, no other phenomenon is simultaneously so familiar
      and so hard to explain. Researchers from fields as different as medicine, philosophy,
      psychology, neurobiology, and computer science have tried for centuries to frame,
      describe, and address the mind\u2013body problem\u2014how consciousness arises
      from purely physical processes\u2014but success has been, to say the least,
      limited. Many believe that it is a phenomenon that will remain, forever, unknowable,
      outside the reach of human understanding. David Chalmers (1) famously argued
      that, while we may advance in our understanding of the different physical processes
      that are associated with consciousness (the easy problems), we will never be
      able to understand the process that leads to subjective experiences (the hard
      problem), since understanding this phenomenon represents a challenge of an entirely
      different nature. Other theories, such as mysterianism, defend that, while the
      phenomenon may be understandable in principle, it will never be accessible to
      the human mind (2), due to intrinsic limitations of the human brain. Despite
      these difficulties, many scientists and philosophers have advanced tentative
      explanations for the phenomenon (3\u20135), and proposed ways to assess it (6),
      measure it (7), create it in machines (8), and even use it to improve the performance
      of artificial intelligence systems (9). The paper by Blum and Blum (10), in
      PNAS, approaches the problem from an engineering perspective, by showing how
      a specific computational architecture, which they have proposed (11), can explain
      several phenomena that are closely related to consciousness.", "venue": "Proceedings

      Dispersion Model (DMmix) and a nonparametric model with six age bins were assumed
      and evaluated using Bayesian statistics. In a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach,
      the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and their uncertainties were determined.
      Model performance was assessed using Bayes factor and leave\u2010one\u2010out
      cross\u2010validation. Both models suggest that the groundwater in the Salalah
      Plain is composed of a very young component below 30 yr and a very old component
      beyond 1,000 yr, with the nonparametric model performing slightly better than
      the DMmix model. All wells except one exhibit reasonable goodness of fit. Our
      results support the relevance of Bayesian modeling in hydrology and the potential
      of nonparametric models for an adequate representation of aquifer dynamics.",

      present moment tN, respectively, and then reverse each other. The category and
      topos of time contradictorily constructed by the mechanism is discussed. It
      is shown that not only can the laws of the \u201cUnification of Opposites\u201d,
      \u201cMutual change of Quality and Quantity\u201d and \u201cNegation of negation\u201d
      of the contradiction be represented in this form of category, but some of classic
      constructions appearing in the fields of mathematics, physics, logic, life,
      nerves, thinking, and intelligence can also be considered as morphosmor pattern-induced
      and emerge via this mechanism as well. On the other hands, a series of concepts,
      models, and algorithms for noetic science, such as the attribute conjunctive
      monoid category (ACMC), attribute reasoning lattice category (ARLC), attribute
      coordinate system (ACS), attribute coordinate analysis method based on the learning

      science research study", "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study uses a design science
      research methodology to develop and evaluate the Pi-Mind agent, an information
      technology artefact that acts as a responsible, resilient, ubiquitous cognitive
      clone \u2013 or a digital copy \u2013 and an autonomous representative of a
      human decision-maker. Pi-Mind agents can learn the decision-making capabilities
      of their \u201cdonors\u201d in a specific training environment based on generative
      adversarial networks. A trained clone can be used by a decision-maker as an
      additional resource for one\u2019s own cognitive enhancement, as an autonomous
      representative, or even as a replacement when appropriate. The assumption regarding
      this approach is as follows: when someone was forced to leave a critical process
      because of, for example, sickness, or wanted to take care of several simultaneously
      running processes, then they would be more confident knowing that their autonomous
      digital representatives were as capable and predictable as their exact personal
      \u201ccopy\u201d. The Pi-Mind agent was evaluated in a Ukrainian higher education
      environment and a military logistics laboratory. In this paper, in addition
      to describing the artefact, its expected utility, and its design process within
      different contexts, we include the corresponding proof of concept, proof of

      the construction and development strategy of intelligent sports system in the

      monopoly, legal supervision, and product iteration. However, there are also
      three promoting factors in this regard, including policy guarantee, market demand,

      public welfare, and collaboration, this paper designs a system for intelligent
      sports in national fitness. The construction of the national fitness intelligent
      sports system mainly consists of four modules, including basic framework construction,
      function design, content design, and operation analysis. With the systematic
      analysis of the status quo of intelligent sports application in national fitness,
      this paper puts forward intelligent sports development strategies in the implementation
      of national fitness from four aspects: optimizing the top-level design of government,
      speeding up industrial transformation and upgrading, constructing market supervision

      "title": "Learning the Treatment Process in Radiotherapy Using an Artificial
      Intelligence\u2013Assisted Chatbot: Development Study", "abstract": "Background
      In knowledge transfer for educational purposes, most cancer hospital or center
      websites have existing information on cancer health. However, such information
      is usually a list of topics that are neither interactive nor customized to offer
      any personal touches to people facing dire health crisis and to attempt to understand
      the concerns of the users. Patients with cancer, their families, and the general
      public accessing the information are often in challenging, stressful situations,
      wanting to access accurate information as efficiently as possible. In addition,
      there is seldom any comprehensive information specifically on radiotherapy,
      despite the large number of older patients with cancer, to go through the treatment
      process. Therefore, having someone with professional knowledge who can listen
      to them and provide the medical information with good will and encouragement
      would help patients and families struggling with critical illness, particularly
      during the lingering pandemic. Objective This study created a novel virtual
      assistant, a chatbot that can explain the radiation treatment process to stakeholders
      comprehensively and accurately, in the absence of any similar software. This
      chatbot was created using the IBM Watson Assistant with artificial intelligence
      and machine learning features. The chatbot or bot was incorporated into a resource
      that can be easily accessed by the general public. Methods The radiation treatment
      process in a cancer hospital or center was described by the radiotherapy process:
      patient diagnosis, consultation, and prescription; patient positioning, immobilization,
      and simulation; 3D-imaging for treatment planning; target and organ contouring;
      radiation treatment planning; patient setup and plan verification; and treatment
      delivery. The bot was created using IBM Watson (IBM Corp) assistant. The natural
      language processing feature in the Watson platform allowed the bot to flow through
      a given conversation structure and recognize how the user responds based on
      recognition of similar given examples, referred to as intents during development.
      Therefore, the bot can be trained using the responses received, by recognizing
      similar responses from the user and analyzing using Watson natural language
      processing. Results The bot is hosted on a website by the Watson application
      programming interface. It is capable of guiding the user through the conversation
      structure and can respond to simple questions and provide resources for requests
      for information that was not directly programmed into the bot. The bot was tested
      by potential users, and the overall averages of the identified metrics are excellent.
      The bot can also acquire users\u2019 feedback for further improvements in the
      routine update. Conclusions An artificial intelligence\u2013assisted chatbot
      was created for knowledge transfer regarding radiation treatment process to
      the patients with cancer, their families, and the general public. The bot that
      is supported by machine learning was tested, and it was found that the bot can
      provide information about radiotherapy effectively.", "venue": "JMIR Formative

      We found that people judge robot paintings and human paintings as art to roughly

      Intelligence systems are able to do in the production of informative texts.
      This raises the question if and how an Artificial Intelligence software system
      can be treated as the author of a text it has produced. Evaluating whether this
      is correct and possible leads to re-examine the current conception for which
      it is taken for granted that the author is a person. This, in turn, when faced
      with texts produced by Artificial Intelligence systems necessarily raises the
      question of whether they, like the author-person, are endowed with agency. The
      article concludes that Artificial Intelligence systems are characterized by
      a distributed agency, shared with those who designed them and make them work,
      and that in the wake of the reflections of 50 years ago by Barthes and Foucault,
      it is necessary to define and recognize a new type of author.", "venue": "JLIS.it",

      developments in specialised computational hardware, data-acquisition and storage
      technology have seen the emergence of Machine Learning (ML) as a powerful form
      of data analysis with widespread applicability beyond its historical roots in
      the design of autonomous agents. However -- possibly because of its origins
      in the development of agents capable of self-discovery -- relatively little
      attention has been paid to the interaction between people and ML. In this paper
      we are concerned with the use of ML in automated or semi-automated tools that
      assist one or more human decision makers. We argue that requirements on both
      human and machine in this context are significantly different to the use of
      ML either as part of autonomous agents for self-discovery or as part statistical
      data analysis. Our principal position is that the design of such human-machine
      systems should be driven by repeated, two-way intelligibility of information
      rather than one-way explainability of the ML-system''s recommendations. Iterated
      rounds of intelligible information exchange, we think, will characterise the
      kinds of collaboration that will be needed to understand complex phenomena for
      which neither man or machine have complete answers. We propose operational principles
      -- we call them Intelligibility Axioms -- to guide the design of a collaborative
      decision-support system. The principles are concerned with: (a) what it means
      for information provided by the human to be intelligible to the ML system; and
      (b) what it means for an explanation provided by an ML system to be intelligible
      to a human. Using examples from the literature on the use of ML for drug-design
      and in medicine, we demonstrate cases where the conditions of the axioms are
      met. We describe some additional requirements needed for the design of a truly
      collaborative decision-support system.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022,

      released as an open resource for more deep and detailed analysis on the language

      "We survey SoTA open-domain conversational AI models with the objective of presenting
      the prevailing challenges that still exist to spur future research. In addition,
      we provide statistics on the gender of conversational AI in order to guide the
      ethics discussion surrounding the issue. Open-domain conversational AI models
      are known to have several challenges, including bland, repetitive responses
      and performance degradation when prompted with figurative language, among others.
      First, we provide some background by discussing some topics of interest in conversational
      AI. We then discuss the method applied to the two investigations carried out
      that make up this study. The first investigation involves a search for recent
      SoTA open-domain conversational AI models, while the second involves the search
      for 100 conversational AI to assess their gender. Results of the survey show
      that progress has been made with recent SoTA conversational AI, but there are
      still persistent challenges that need to be solved, and the female gender is
      more common than the male for conversational AI. One main takeaway is that hybrid
      models of conversational AI offer more advantages than any single architecture.
      The key contributions of this survey are (1) the identification of prevailing
      challenges in SoTA open-domain conversational AI, (2) the rarely held discussion
      on open-domain conversational AI for low-resource languages, and (3) the discussion
      about the ethics surrounding the gender of conversational AI.", "venue": "Inf.",

      personalized healthcare of elderly people, our interest is to develop a virtual
      caregiver system that retrieves the expression of mental and physical health
      states through human\u2013computer interaction in the form of dialogue. The
      purpose of this paper is to implement and evaluate a virtual caregiver system
      using mobile chatbot. Unlike the conventional health monitoring approach, our
      key idea is to integrate a rule-based virtual caregiver system (called \u201cMind
      Monitoring\u201d service) with the physical, mental, and social questionnaires
      into the mobile chat application. The elderly person receives one question from
      the mobile chatbot per day, and answers it by pushing the optional button or
      using a speech recognition technique. Furthermore, a novel method is implemented
      to quantify the answers, generate visual graphs, and send the corresponding
      summaries or advice to the specific elder. In the experimental evaluation, we
      applied it to eight elderly subjects and 19 younger subjects within 14 months.
      As main results, its effects were significantly improved by the proposed method,
      including the above 80% in the response rate, the accurate reflection of their
      real lives from the responses, and high usefulness of the feedback messages
      with software quality requirements and evaluation. We also conducted interviews
      with subjects for health analysis and improvement.", "venue": "Italian National

      years of evolution, living animals have adapted extremely well to their ecological
      niche. Such adaptation implies species-specific interactions with their immediate
      environment by processing sensory cues and responding with appropriate behavior.
      Understanding how living creatures perform pattern recognition and cognitive
      tasks is of particular importance for computing architectures: by studying these
      information pathways refined over eons of evolution, researchers may be able
      to streamline the process of developing more highly advanced, energy efficient
      autonomous systems. With the advent of novel electronic and ionic components
      along with a deeper understanding of information pathways in living species,
      a plethora of opportunities to develop completely novel information processing
      avenues are within reach. Here, we describe the basal information pathways in
      nervous systems, from the local neuron level to the entire nervous system network.
      The dual importance of local learning rules is addressed, from spike timing
      dependent plasticity at the neuron level to the interwoven morphological and
      dynamical mechanisms of the global network. Basal biological principles are
      highlighted, including phylogenies, ontogenesis, and homeostasis, with particular
      emphasis on network topology and dynamics. While in machine learning system
      training is performed on virgin networks without any a priori knowledge, the
      approach proposed here distinguishes itself unambiguously by employing growth
      mechanisms as a guideline to design novel computing architectures. Including
      fundamental biological information pathways that explore the spatiotemporal
      fundamentals of nervous systems has untapped potential for the development of
      entirely novel information processing systems. Finally, a benchmark for neuromorphic

      inclusion of non-human animals and artificial intelligences in human sonic collaborations.
      Post-humanist concepts that question the categorical divide between nature and
      culture, following Donna Haraway and Bruno Latour, converge with contemporary,
      non-adaptationist evolutionary aesthetics. Therefore, the anthropocentric \u2018othering\u2019
      of non-humans gives way to a concept of a more-than-human sociality of sound.
      We offer some theoretical propositions for the extension of socially engaged
      sound practices to collaborations between humans and non-human animals and between
      humans and artificial intelligences, and then exemplify such multispecies sonic
      collaborations by analysing some existing projects from the fields of sound
      art and musical performance. After drawing some more general conclusions from
      these analyses, we hint at potential aesthetical and ethical parallels between
      animal and AI creative agency. Finally, we point out a few questions we see
      as important for future advanced settings of such collaborations, especially
      when it comes to assemblages of different AI technologies and to future concepts

      to cautiously progress a few steps closer to a better understanding of some
      necessary organisational conditions that are central to self-concern in biological

      "title": "Shifting Perspectives on AI Evaluation: The Increasing Role of Ethics
      in Cooperation", "abstract": "Evaluating AI is a challenging task, as it requires
      an operative definition of intelligence and the metrics to quantify it, including
      amongst other factors economic drivers, depending on specific domains. From
      the viewpoint of AI basic research, the ability to play a game against a human
      has historically been adopted as a criterion of evaluation, as competition can
      be characterized by an algorithmic approach. Starting from the end of the 1990s,
      the deployment of sophisticated hardware identified a significant improvement
      in the ability of a machine to play and win popular games. In spite of the spectacular
      victory of IBM\u2019s Deep Blue over Garry Kasparov, many objections still remain.
      This is due to the fact that it is not clear how this result can be applied
      to solve real-world problems or simulate human abilities, e.g., common sense,
      and also exhibit a form of generalized AI. An evaluation based uniquely on the
      capacity of playing games, even when enriched by the capability of learning
      complex rules without any human supervision, is bound to be unsatisfactory.
      As the internet has dramatically changed the cultural habits and social interaction
      of users, who continuously exchange information with intelligent agents, it
      is quite natural to consider cooperation as the next step in AI software evaluation.
      Although this concept has already been explored in the scientific literature
      in the fields of economics and mathematics, its consideration in AI is relatively
      recent and generally covers the study of cooperation between agents. This paper
      focuses on more complex problems involving heterogeneity (specifically, the
      cooperation between humans and software agents, or even robots), which are investigated
      by taking into account ethical issues occurring during attempts to achieve a
      common goal shared by both parties, with a possible result of either conflict
      or stalemate. The contribution of this research consists in identifying those
      factors (trust, autonomy, and cooperative learning) on which to base ethical
      guidelines in agent software programming, making cooperation a more suitable
      benchmark for AI applications.", "venue": "Applied Informatics", "year": 2022,

      This framework is informed by tracing the historical evolution of this technology
      in the past 70\u2009years which saw the rise of three constitutive features
      in machines: AI, interaction, and assistance. A review of technology\u2019s
      definitions published since 2010 and associated terminologies was also conducted
      to unpack their conceptual limitations and support the framework. A new definition

      functioning (planning to act), postural control (bodily poise for turning plans
      into action), and effortful perception (action to gather information in a single
      modality and action to blend multimodal information). We also review findings
      on neuronal avalanches in the brain, specifically about neural participation
      in body-wide cascades. Turing''s cascade instability blends the mind, brain,

      robots has been approached by researchers from a variety of disciplines, including
      psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and philosophy. As a consequence,
      the empirical studies that have been conducted so far exhibit considerable diversity
      in terms of how the phenomenon is described and how it is approached from a
      theoretical and methodological standpoint. This literature review addresses
      the need for a shared scientific understanding of mental state attribution to
      robots by systematically and comprehensively collating conceptions, methods,
      and findings from 155 empirical studies across multiple disciplines. The findings
      of the review include that: (1) the terminology used to describe mental state
      attribution to robots is diverse but largely homogenous in usage; (2) the tendency
      to attribute mental states to robots is determined by factors such as the age
      and motivation of the human as well as the behavior, appearance, and identity
      of the robot; (3) there is a computer < robot < human pattern in the tendency
      to attribute mental states that appears to be moderated by the presence of socially
      interactive behavior; (4) there are conflicting findings in the empirical literature
      that stem from different sources of evidence, including self-report and non-verbal
      behavioral or neurological data. The review contributes toward more cumulative
      research on the topic and opens up for a transdisciplinary discussion about
      the nature of the phenomenon and what types of research methods are appropriate

      Language Processing", "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence has guided technological
      progress in recent years; it has shown significant development with increased
      academic studies on Machine Learning and the high demand for this field in the
      sector. In addition to the advancement of technology day by day, the pandemic,
      which has become a part of our lives since early 2020, has led to social media
      occupying a larger place in the lives of individuals. Therefore, social media
      posts have become an excellent data source for the field of sentiment analysis.
      The main contribution of this study is based on the Natural Language Processing
      method, which is one of the machine learning topics in the literature. Sentiment
      analysis classification is a solid example for machine learning tasks that belongs
      to human-machine interaction. It is essential to make the computer understand
      people emotional situation with classifiers. There are a limited number of Turkish
      language studies in the literature. Turkish language has different types of
      linguistic features from English. Since Turkish is an agglutinative language,
      it is challenging to make sentiment analysis with that language. This paper
      aims to perform sentiment analysis of several machine learning algorithms on
      Turkish language datasets that are collected from Twitter. In this research,
      besides using public dataset that belongs to Beyaz (2021) to get more general
      results, another dataset is created to understand the impact of the pandemic
      on people and to learn about public opinions. Therefore, a custom dataset, namely,
      SentimentSet (Balli 2021), was created, consisting of Turkish tweets that were
      filtered with words such as pandemic and corona by manually marking as positive,
      negative, or neutral. Besides, SentimentSet could be used in future researches
      as benchmark dataset. Results show classification accuracy of not only up to
      \u223c87% with test data from datasets of both datasets and trained models,
      but also up to \u223c84% with small \u201cSample Test Data\u201d generated by
      the same methods as SentimentSet dataset. These research results contributed
      to indicating Turkish language specific sentiment analysis that is dependent
      on language specifications.", "venue": "Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience",

      Visualization", "abstract": "We offer a new model of the sensemaking process
      for data analysis and visualization. Whereas past sensemaking models have been
      grounded in positivist assumptions about the nature of knowledge, we reframe
      data sensemaking in critical, humanistic terms by approaching it through an
      interpretivist lens. Our three-phase process model uses the analogy of an iceberg,
      where data is the visible tip of underlying schemas. In the Add phase, the analyst
      acquires data, incorporates explicit schemas from the data, and absorbs the
      tacit schemas of both data and people. In the Check phase, the analyst interprets
      the data with respect to the current schemas and evaluates whether the schemas
      match the data. In the Refine phase, the analyst considers the role of power,
      articulates what was tacit into explicitly stated schemas, updates data, and
      formulates findings. Our model has four important distinguishing features: Tacit
      and Explicit Schemas, Schemas First and Always, Data as a Schematic Artifact,
      and Schematic Multiplicity. We compare the roles of schemas in past sensemaking
      models and draw conceptual distinctions based on a historical review of schemas
      in different academic traditions. We validate the descriptive and prescriptive
      power of our model through four analysis scenarios: noticing uncollected data,
      learning to wrangle data, downplaying inconvenient data, and measuring with
      sensors. We conclude by discussing the value of interpretivism, the virtue of
      epistemic humility, and the pluralism this sensemaking model can foster.", "venue":

      "abstract": "\nPurpose\nHave you been to a smart restaurant, and how were its
      services? A common limitation of hospitality studies stems from the lack of
      research on how service quality is shaped within smart technology. This study
      aims to fill this literature void not merely to reiterate the importance of
      technology but also to recast service quality through the lens of information
      technology. It synthesizes the 5-S model of smart service quality (AKA SSQ)
      as a new conceptualization of service quality application in smart hospitality
      contexts such as smart restaurants.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study
      undertook a qualitative research design based on theoretical synthesis from
      service quality, information technology and attention restoration. Drawing from
      online review comments and semistructured interviews from smart restaurants,
      the authors improvised the SSQ model to identify the essence of smart service
      in smart dining establishments.\n\n\nFindings\n\u201c5-S\u201d reflects an extension
      of the literature to denote a new SSQ abstraction pertinent to s-servicescape,
      s-assurance, s-responsiveness, s-reliability and s-empathy. A nomological network
      was posited to better understand the importance of smart design and consequence
      of SSQ.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe emergence of smart dining
      gives rise to smart restaurants, which puts technology at center stage. As consumers
      are becoming increasingly comfortable with self-service technology, auto-payment
      and ordering systems and robotic services, technology in foodservice will continue
      to play an essential role to better serve diners. Geared with advanced innovations
      and intelligent devices, smart restaurants are now more than mere eateries.
      It is a trend and a lifestyle.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis novel SSQ concept
      adds new nuances to the literature by acknowledging the technological essence
      in today\u2019s hospitality industry. By integrating smart technology into the
      service quality paradigm, the authors are able to observe several interesting
      behaviors exhibited during smart dining, including tech-induced restoration,
      which opens a new avenue to understand how attention restoration could be attained
      through immersion in a technologically advanced setting. By synthesizing theoretical
      essence from service quality, attention restoration and information technology,
      the authors are able to create a new dialog that should warrant a forum of discussion
      in future studies.\n", "venue": "International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality

      Functional Perspective", "abstract": "Robotics and AI-based applications (RAI)
      are often said to be so technologically advanced that they should be held responsible
      for their actions, instead of the human who designs or operates them. The paper
      aims to prove that this thesis (\u201cthe exceptionalist claim\u201d)\u2014as
      it stands\u2014is both theoretically incorrect and practically inadequate. Indeed,
      the paper argues that such claim is based on a series of misunderstanding over
      the very notion and functions of \u201clegal responsibility\u201d, which it
      then seeks to clarify by developing and interdisciplinary conceptual taxonomy.
      In doing so, it aims to set the premises for a more constructive debate over
      the feasibility of granting legal standing to robotic application. After a short
      Introduction setting the stage of the debate, the paper addresses the ontological
      claim, distinguishing the philosophical from the legal debate on the notion
      of i) subjectivity and ii) agency, with their respective implications. The analysis
      allows us to conclude that the attribution of legal subjectivity and agency
      are purely fictional and technical solutions to facilitate legal interactions,
      and is not dependent upon the intrinsic nature of the RAI. A similar structure
      is maintained with respect to the notion of responsibility, addressed first
      in a philosophical and then legal perspective, to demonstrate how the latter
      is often utilized to both pursue ex ante deterrence and ex post compensation.
      The focus on the second objective allows us to bridge the analysis towards functional
      (law and economics based) considerations, to discuss how even the attribution
      of legal personhood may be conceived as an attempt to simplify certain legal
      interactions and relations. Within such a framework, the discussion whether
      to attribute legal subjectivity to the machine needs to be kept entirely within
      the legal domain, and grounded on technical (legal) considerations, to be argued
      on a functional, bottom-up analysis of specific classes of RAI. That does not
      entail the attribution of animacy or the ascription of a moral status to the
      entity itself.", "venue": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      robot (SR) research through the lens of suffering. First three kinds of suffering

      to be primarily subjective, and distinctive psychological and existential sufferings
      probably do exist, which are neither reducible to neurobiological events, nor
      replicable through algorithms. The current stage of SR research is then reviewed.
      Many creative proposals are presented, together with some philosophical and
      technical challenges posed by other scholars. I then offer my critique of SR
      research, claiming that it is based on a superficial understanding of suffering
      and unjustified philosophical presuppositions, namely, reductive physicalism.
      Without the capability to suffer, robots probably cannot love in any real sense,
      and no meaningful relationship may be developed between such a robot and a human.

      1950 paper \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d. He also described

      imitation game in which a computer tries to fool a human interrogator into thinking
      that it\u2019s a person.[1] Seven decades later, despite all the advances in
      artificial intelligence (AI), no computer has conclusively passed the Turing
      Test. Despite the failure to conquer the bar of artificial general intelligence
      prescribed by Turing, computers have come to become an inseparable part of our

      Tests of understanding, such as Turing''s imitation game, are numerous; yet,

      Intelligent agents designed to pass one test of understanding often fall short
      of others. Rather than approaching understanding as a system state, in this
      paper, we argue that understanding is a process that changes over time and experience.
      The only window into the process is through the lens of natural language. Usefully,
      failures of understanding reveal breakdowns in the process. We propose a set

      "This study presents applicability of conventional deep recurrent neural networks
      (RNN) to predict path-dependent plasticity associated with material heterogeneity
      and anisotropy. Although the architecture of RNN possess inductive biases toward
      information over time, it is a still challenging to to learn the path-dependent
      material behavior as a function of loading path considering the change from
      elastic to elasto-plastic regimes. Our attempt is to develop a simple machine-learning
      based model that can replicate elastoplastic behaviors considering material
      heterogeneity and anisotropy. The basic Long-Short Term Memory Unit (LSTM) is
      adopted for the modeling of plasticity in the two-dimensional space by enhancing
      the inductive bias toward the past information through manipulating input variables.
      Our results find that a single LSTM based model can capture the J2 plasticity
      responses under both monotonic and arbitrary loading paths provided the material
      heterogeneity. The proposed neural network architecture is then used to model
      elasto-plastic responses of a two-dimensional transversely anisotropic material
      associated with computational homogenization (FE 2 ). It is also found that
      a single LSTM model can be used to accurately and effectively capture the path-dependent

      an artificial intelligence (AI) architecture intended to simulate the human

      It features several interconnected neural networks designed to emulate the specialized
      modules of the cerebral cortex. These are structured hierarchically and integrated
      into a global workspace. They are capable of temporarily maintaining high-level
      patterns akin to the psychological items maintained in working memory. This
      maintenance is made possible by persistent neural activity in the form of two
      modalities: sustained neural firing (resulting in a focus of attention) and
      synaptic potentiation (resulting in a short-term store). This persistent activity
      is updated iteratively resulting in incremental changes to the content of the
      working memory system. As the content stored in working memory gradually evolves,
      successive states overlap and are continuous with one another. The present article
      will explore how this architecture can lead to gradual shift in the distribution
      of coactive representations, ultimately leading to mental continuity between
      processing states, and thus to human-like cognition. map with an iteratively

      On the other hand, they also raised the possibility of several issues caused

      and the transparency of the decisions made by the AI system. These results can

      "title": "Trust in AI and Its Role in the Acceptance of AI Technologies", "abstract":
      "Abstract As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains,
      there is an increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have
      in such technologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly
      sophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper
      addresses this need by explaining the role of trust in the intention to use
      AI technologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants
      based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that
      trust had a significant effect the on intention to use AI, which operated through
      perceived usefulness and participants\u2019 attitude toward voice assistants.
      In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population,
      different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis,
      which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The
      results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming
      the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of
      use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared
      a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust
      exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust.
      Overall, the role of trust in the acceptance of AI technologies was significant
      across both studies. This research contributes to the advancement and application
      of the TAM in AI-related applications and offers a multidimensional measure
      of trust that can be utilized in the future study of trustworthy AI.", "venue":

      a premissa \u201cM\u00e1quinas s\u00e3o capazes de pensar?\u201d. Nesse sentido,
      percebe-se que os chatbots est\u00e3o diretamente relacionados a essa ideia,

      analysis for being a \u201cprecise and unquestionably adequate definition\u201d

      a short note in 1972 claiming to have found a \u201cphilosophical error\u201d
      in Turing\u2019s argument with regard to the finite nature of mental states

      conferred on his results by Turing\u2019s work, despite the error of its ways?
      Previous interpretative strategies by Feferman, Shagrir and others have mainly
      tried to resolve the disparity by distinguishing different types of arguments
      in Turing and taking G\u00f6del to approve only some of them. By a more integral
      examination of their ideas, especially Turing\u2019s response to the \u201cmathematical

      main ideas of current developments in machine learning into consideration, I
      will try to present a new explanation for the apparent disparity, arguing that
      there is no \u201cerror\u201d on Turing\u2019s side and the seemingly conflicting
      views held by Turing and G\u00f6del should best be seen as complementary, keeping

      (SHM) has been the prognosis of damage and the prediction of the remaining useful

      tasks, but they have been either deterministic or stochastic with the ability
      to take into account only a restricted set of past states of the structure.
      In the current work, a generative model is proposed in order to make predictions
      about the damage evolution of structures. The model is able to perform in a
      population-based SHM (PBSHM) framework, to take into account many past states
      of the damaged structure, to incorporate uncertainties in the modelling process
      and to generate potential damage evolution outcomes according to data acquired
      from a structure. The algorithm is tested on a simulated damage evolution example

      "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThis paper contributes to the literature by discussing
      the impact of machine learning (ML) on management accounting (MA) and the management
      accountant based on three sources: academic articles, papers and reports from
      accounting bodies and consulting companies. The purpose of this paper is to
      identify, discuss and provide suggestions for how ML could be included in research
      and education in the future for the management accountant.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis
      paper identifies three types of studies on the influence of ML on MA issued
      between 2015 and 2021 in mainstream accounting journals, by professional accounting
      bodies and by large consulting companies.\n\n\nFindings\nFirst, only very few
      academic articles actually show examples of using ML or using different algorithms
      related to MA issues. This is in contrast to other research fields such as finance
      and logistics. Second, the literature review also indicates that if the management
      accountants want to keep up with the demand of their qualifications, they must
      take action now and begin to discuss how big data and other concepts from artificial
      intelligence and ML can benefit MA and the management accountant in specific

      first two tasks of the CLEF 2019 ProtestNews events focused on distinguishing
      between protest and non-protest related news articles and sentences in a binary
      classification task. Among the submissions, two well performing models have
      been chosen in order to replace the existing word embeddings word2vec and FastTest
      with ELMo and DistilBERT. Unlike bag of words or earlier vector approaches,
      ELMo and DistilBERT represent words as a sequence of vectors by capturing the
      meaning based on contextual information in the text. Without changing the architecture
      of the original models other than the word embeddings, the implementation of
      DistilBERT improved the performance measured on the F1-Score of 0.66 compared
      to the FastText implementation. DistilBERT also outperformed ELMo in both tasks
      and models. Cleaning the datasets by removing stopwords and lemmatizing the
      words has been shown to make the models more generalizable across different
      contexts when training on a dataset with Indian news articles and evaluating
      the models on a dataset with news articles from China.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      Turing test has been used to investigate whether machines have intelligence
      similar to humans. Our study aimed to assess the ability of an artificial intelligence
      (AI) system for spine tumor detection using the Turing test. Methods Our retrospective
      study data included 12179 images from 321 patients for developing AI detection
      systems and 6635 images from 187 patients for the Turing test. We utilized a
      deep learning-based tumor detection system with Faster R-CNN architecture, which
      generates region proposals by Region Proposal Network in the first stage and
      corrects the position and the size of the bounding box of the lesion area in
      the second stage. Each choice question featured four bounding boxes enclosing
      an identical tumor. Three were detected by the proposed deep learning model,
      whereas the other was annotated by a doctor; the results were shown to six doctors
      as respondents. If the respondent did not correctly identify the image annotated
      by a human, his answer was considered a misclassification. If all misclassification
      rates were >30%, the respondents were considered unable to distinguish the AI-detected
      tumor from the human-annotated one, which indicated that the AI system passed
      the Turing test. Results The average misclassification rates in the Turing test
      were 51.2% (95% CI: 45.7%\u201357.5%) in the axial view (maximum of 62%, minimum
      of 44%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 38.2%\u201351.8%) in the sagittal view (maximum of
      59%, minimum of 36%). The misclassification rates of all six respondents were
      >30%; therefore, our AI system passed the Turing test. Conclusion Our proposed
      intelligent spine tumor detection system has a similar detection ability to
      annotation doctors and may be an efficient tool to assist radiologists or orthopedists
      in primary spine tumor detection.", "venue": "Frontiers in Oncology", "year":

      of Artificial Intelligence Art", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence
      (AI) art is the product of AI technology applied to art. In terms of technical
      application, AI art has two methods: symbolism and connectivism. In terms of
      the human-machine system, there are three levels: human using machine, human
      guiding machine and human-machine separation. AI art is a special form, existing
      between natural beauty and human art: AI art, first of all, is not a natural
      aesthetic object, given that it is the product of artefacts. Its appreciation
      is mixed with interests, and its artistic generation is a kind of \u201cpurposeful
      non-purposefulness.\u201d Secondly, AI art is not equal to traditional human
      art, because AI has no intentionality or consciousness. Thirdly, AI participates
      in the construction of artistic logic and breaks the boundary of traditional
      art. AI can be regarded as an \u201cagent\u201d in art generation, and together
      with people constitute the \u201cactor network\u201d of art. The processes of
      generation, identification and appreciation of AI art include the judgment of
      true and false. AI art reflects the forced integration of intelligent technology
      into art, an attempt to rid of contingency, dialectics, and negativity of art.
      But what we need is the real harmonisation of art and technology. People should
      use aesthetic reason to guide AI technology.", "venue": "Critical Arts. A Journal

      "abstract": "The dream of achieving artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular,
      artificial consciousness (\u2018strong AI\u2019), is reflected in mythologies
      and popular culture as utopia and dystopia. This article discusses its conceptual
      possibility. It first relates the desire to realise strong AI to a self-perception
      of humanity as opposed to nature, metaphorically represented as gods or God.
      The realisation of strong AI is perceived as an ultimate victory on nature or
      God because it represents the crown of creation or evolution: conscious intelligence.
      The paper proceeds to summarise two debates relevant to AI: one educational
      and one technological. The technological debate, almost invariably presupposing
      a materialist framework, is related to the mind\u2013body problem of philosophy;
      the educational one to understanding the concept of intelligence. By proposing
      a definition of intelligence linked to an idealist conception of reality, postulating
      mind as participation in Absolute Mind, I attempt a convergence of these debates,
      rejecting the possibility of strong AI.", "venue": "Scientia et Fides", "year":

      "title": "Caregiver Expectations of Interfacing With Voice Assistants to Support
      Complex Home Care: Mixed Methods Study", "abstract": "Background Providing care
      in home environments is complex, and often the pressure is on caregivers to
      document information and ensure care continuity. Digital information management
      and communication technologies may support care coordination among caregivers.
      However, they have yet to be adopted in this context, partly because of issues
      with supporting long-term disease progression and caregiver anxiety. Voice assistant
      (VA) technology is a promising method for interfacing with digital health information
      that may aid in multiple aspects of being a caregiver, thereby influencing adoption.
      Understanding the expectations for VAs to support caregivers is fundamental
      to inform the practical development of this technology. Objective This study
      explored caregivers\u2019 perspectives on using VA technology to support caregiving
      and inform the design of future digital technologies in complex home care. Methods
      This study was part of a larger study of caregivers across North America on
      the design of digital health technologies to support health communication and
      information management in complex home care. Caregivers included parents, guardians,
      and hired caregivers such as personal support workers and home care nurses.
      Video interviews were conducted with caregivers to capture their mental models
      on the potential application of VAs in complex home care and were theoretically
      analyzed using the technology acceptance model. Interviews were followed up
      with Likert-scale questions exploring perspectives on other VA applications
      beyond participants\u2019 initial perceptions. Results Data were collected from
      22 caregivers, and 3 themes were identified: caregivers\u2019 perceived usefulness
      of VAs in supporting documentation, care coordination, and person-centered care;
      caregivers\u2019 perceived ease of use in navigating information efficiently
      (they also had usability concerns with this interaction method); and caregivers\u2019
      concerns, excitement, expected costs, and previous experience with VAs that
      influenced their attitudes toward use. From the Likert-scale questions, most
      participants (21/22, 95%) agreed that VAs should support prompted information
      recording and retrieval, and all participants (22/22, 100%) agreed that they
      should provide reminders. They also agreed that VAs should support them in an
      emergency (18/22, 82%)\u2014but only for calling emergency services\u2014and
      guide caregivers through tasks (21/22, 95%). However, participants were less
      agreeable on VAs expressing a personality (14/22, 64%)\u2014concerned they would
      manipulate caregivers\u2019 perceptions\u2014and listening ambiently to remind
      caregivers about their documentation (16/22, 73%). They were much less agreeable
      about VAs providing unprompted assistance on caregiving tasks (9/22, 41%). Conclusions
      The interviews and Likert-scale results point toward the potential for VAs to
      support family caregivers and hired caregivers by easing their information management
      and health communication at home. However, beyond information interaction, the
      potential impact of VA personality traits on caregivers\u2019 perceptions of
      the care situation and the passive collection of audio data to improve user
      experience through context-specific interactions are critical design considerations
      that should be further examined.", "venue": "JMIR Human Factors", "year": 2022,

      Model in Short-Term Trading", "abstract": "In recent years, the expansion of
      the cryptocurrency market has received significant attention among investors,
      studies of cryptocurrency price predictions have been conducted in various fields.
      With the enhancement of machine learning algorithms and increased computational
      capabilities, machine learning has proved one of the most efficient cryptocurrency
      prediction methods. However, most studies focused on single digital currency
      prediction or small-scale algorithm comparison for multiple currencies. This
      study aims to present a comparative performance of large-scale selected Machine
      Learning algorithms for cryptocurrency forecasting. Specifically, this paper
      concentrates on forecasting time series data for a short-term trading period
      in ten cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, ADA, BNB, XRP, DOGE, LUNA, LINK, LTC, and
      BCH) with ten selected machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Linear Regression,
      Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Bayesian Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest
      Neighbors, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine).
      Our experiment results show that the Gradient Boosting with the mean square
      error criterion is superior in predicting most major cryptocurrencies by performing
      statistical analysis and data visualizations. Additionally, the Random Forest
      and Decision Tree model built by the Classification and Regression Tree algorithm
      also shows outstanding performance in certain currencies such as ETH, XRP, LUNA,
      and LTC. Thus, all three algorithms can help anticipate the short-term evolutions
      of the cryptocurrency market.", "venue": "2022 Asia Conference on Algorithms,

      mental dimension is an experiential state achieved by neural circuits, that
      cannot be measured by physical means but that nonetheless affects the behavior
      of conscious neural creatures. The \u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201cworth\u201d
      of anything in the life of animals is based on emotive factors that are recalled
      from past experience. Emotive memory is the key to the \u201cconsciousness\u201d
      that determines decisions and valuations. Even supposedly rational economic
      decisions are ultimately based on affective considerations. From the Darwinian
      perspective, neural signaling evolved from bacterial signaling processes which
      employed small molecules (i.e. biogenic amines). The tripartite mechanism provides
      a chemodynamic rationale for considering the physiologic basis of such signaling,
      a key facet of \u201cconsciousness\u201d. We note that the original bacterial
      signaling molecules (i.e. biogenic amines), later termed \u201cneuro-transmitters\u201d
      (NTs)) were retained by and still used by all neurons. To clarify the discussion,
      we de-limit the meaning of terms commonly used by both computer scientists and

      \u201clogic\u201d and \u201cdimension\u201d). Mind and body are a complex unity.
      The psyche emerges from the physiology and chemistry of interacting neurons,
      projecting an ensemble of physiologic sensibilities into a psychic (mental)
      dimension. Without memory, there are no emotions and vice versa\u2026without
      emotive qualities, memory fades. Emotions and memory are linked facets of the

      Memory", "abstract": "Emotions are the anchoring experiences on which psychology
      is aimed. The challenge of neuroscientists is to clarify how neural nets generate
      mental states, such as emotive memory. To that end, Atkinson- hiffin (AS) (1950)
      proposed mathematical algorithms and formulae to describe memory. Our critique
      of their approach is based on 3 issues: Evolution, Physiology and Emotions.
      What is missing in the AS mathematical model is a physiologically relevant process
      for encoding emotive memory. \u201cMeta-physics\u201d is the branch of philosophy
      that examines the fundamental nature of reality i.e. the relationship between
      energy and matter. \u201dMeta-chemistry\u201d (\u201cPsycho-chemistry\u201d)
      could be considered to be the branch of chemistry that deals with mental states
      emerging from neuro- chemical processes. However, what does \u201cMeta-mathematics\u201d
      imply? Does mathematics delve into matters of Mind as well as Logic? Neuro-math?
      Neither the metrics of physics nor the mathematics of Atkinson-Shiffin can credibly
      characterize the process of recalling Emotive states. Only chemistry can pierce
      the veil of neurophysiology. For example, emotive states can be instigated by
      chemical entities, such as \u201cneurotransmitters\u201d (NTs) and recreational
      drugs. In consideration of this, we propose a biochemical tripartite mechanism
      involving neurons interacting with their surrounding extracellular matrix (nECM)
      which serve as \u201cmemory material\u201d. Incoming perceptions are encoded
      with trace metals + neurotransmitters (NTs) ejected by neurons, to form metal-centered
      cognitive units of information (cuinfo) from which memory is consolidated. The
      NTs can be considered the effectors and encoders of emotive mental states achieved
      by the neural net. Regarding the Atkinson-Shiffin approach, we opine: Emotions

      "title": "Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Artificial
      Intelligence in the Biomedical Domain", "abstract": "\u2013 In this article,
      we first give an introduction to artificial intelligence and its applications
      in biology and medicine in Section 1. Deep learning methods are then described
      in Section 2. We narrow down the focus of the study on textual data in Section
      3, where natural language processing and its applications in the biomedical
      domain are described. In Section 4, we give an introduction to explainable artificial
      intelligence and discuss the importance of explainability of artificial intelligence
      systems, especially in the biomedical domain. 1. Artificial Intelligence Artificial
      Intelligence (AI) is a scientific field that studies computer systems performing
      tasks that need human intelligence. AI systems aim at doing intelligent tasks
      such as learning from experience, knowledge representation, problem solving,
      reasoning, perception, and natural language processing, which are associated
      with cognitive functions of human mind (Russell and Norvig, 2009). Nowadays,
      AI systems have many applications in a wide variety of domains such as education,
      medicine, transportation, military, entertainment, finance, autonomous driving,
      smartphones, agriculture, social media, economy, healthcare, law, manufacturing,
      cybersecurity, and many other domains. Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing,
      and Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Biomedical Domain 2 Since early
      work on artificial neurons in the 1940s (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943), different
      generations of AI methods have been developed. Alan Turing\u2019s theory of
      computation, the idea of a thinking machine, and the Turing test formed solid
      theoretical foundations and a milestone in early stages of development of machine
      intelligence in the 1950s (Turing, 1950). Then in the 1960s and 1970s, symbolic
      AI systems such as the General Problem Solver, the Geometry Theorem Prover,
      and the Logic Theorist employed high-level human-readable knowledge representation,
      logic programming, and reasoning to search for solutions to problems (Russell
      and Norvig, 2009). Knowledge-based and expert systems then became popular in
      the 1980s. This generation of AI systems leveraged more powerful, domain-specific
      knowledge (typically special-purpose rule sets in combination with customized
      inference methods) to solve problems in narrower fields of expertise. Meanwhile,
      connectionism was revived and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) moved the field
      forward towards performing more difficult and intelligent tasks, e.g. optical
      character recognition and speech recognition (Hopfield, 1988; Russell and Norvig,
      2009). With the rapid adoption of Internet in the 1990s, AI tools such as recommender
      systems, search engines, and machine translation systems found their way into
      everyday life. ANNs are computational methods inspired by the biological nervous
      systems. A neural network consists of multiple layers of interconnected processing
      units called \u201cneurons\u201d that are able to perform parallel computations.
      They are mostly used for data processing and knowledge representation purposes
      (Ramesh et al., 2004). ANNs have become attractive data analytics tools since
      they have the capability of handling complex, non-linear data relationships.
      A typical neuron in an ANN receives inputs from the previous layer in the network,
      aggregates the inputs, applies an activation function, and produces a final
      output based on the activation function\u2019s output and a threshold. Since
      the advent of ANNs in the 1940s (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943), artificial neurons
      have evolved from simple binary threshold functions to complex non-linear processing
      units in CNNs, RNNs, and transformer models. In the first decades of the 21st
      century, availability of large volumes of data (known as \u201cbig data\u201d),
      extremely powerful processors specially designed to run floating-point arithmetic
      computation, novel multi-layer ANN architectures, and advanced machine learning
      techniques have led to the development of a new class of AI methods, called
      \u201cdeep learning\u201d (LeCun et al., 2015). Machine learning refers to a
      class of AI methods designed to learn data relationships hidden in a dataset
      of samples, and then generalize the learned knowledge to new unseen data samples.
      Accordingly, deep learning refers Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing,
      and Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the Biomedical Domain 3 to a class
      of machine learning methods comprising multiple layers of processing units,
      designed to build complex generative or predictive models from large datasets.
      Modern deep neural networks, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent
      Neural Networks (RNNs), have been widely used to model complex data relationships
      for a wide variety of scientific and industrial applications (Khamparia and
      Singh, 2019). 1.1. Artificial Intelligence in biomedicine and healthcare AI
      systems have many applications in biomedical research and healthcare domains
      (Hamet and Tremblay, 2017; Min et al., 2017; Ramesh et al., 2004; Rav\u00ec
      et al., 2017). In many use-cases, AI methods have performed as accurate as human
      experts, even performed better than humans in some cases (Mintz and Brodie,
      2019). ANNs are among the most widely-used AI methods utilized in the biomedical
      domain (Ramesh et al., 2004). Large amounts of data in the biomedical domain
      make demands for developing intelligent computer methods that facilitate automatic
      acquisition and analysis of knowledge that is necessary to solve problems in
      biology and medicine. Utilizing AI systems for medical applications dates back
      to the 1970s, when computer analysis helped clinicians diagnose acute abdominal
      pain (Gunn, 1976). Since many biological, clinical, and pathological variables
      involve in complex interactions in biomedical datasets, ANN and deep learning
      models have been extensively applied to data science problems in biology and
      medicine. One of the first applications of ANN for clinical decision making
      aimed at diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (Baxt, 1990). In clinical settings,
      AI systems have found many applications in diagnostic tasks such as image analysis
      in radiology and histopathology, waveform analysis, interpreting data in intensive
      care situation, and analysing Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI), X-rays, and radioisotope scans (Amisha et al., 2019; Mintz and Brodie,
      2019; Ramesh et al., 2004). AI methods have also had applications in clinical
      prognostic tasks such as identifying high risk patients, predicting survival
      chance in patients, and predicting outcome in patients with specific cancers
      (Ramesh et al., 2004). Another type of AI systems, i.e. AI-robots, have been
      used as assistant-surgeons or solo performers in surgery, or as care-bots for
      assisting in the delivery of care (Amisha et al., 2019; Hamet and Tremblay,
      2017). They can be also used to monitor the guided delivery of drugs to target
      tumours, tissues, or organs (Hamet and Tremblay, 2017). In biomedical research,
      machine learning methods have had applications in discovering novel Deep Learning,
      Natural Language Processing, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence in the
      Biomedical Domain 4 therapeutic targets using protein-protein interaction algorithms
      (Theofilatos et al., 2015), identifying DNA variants as predictors of a specific
      disease (Rapakoulia et al., 2014), Image and text are two data modalities in
      the biomedical domain that are commonly analysed using machine learning methods.
      AI-driven image processing have many applications in radiology, oncology, cardiology,
      gastroenterology, ophthalmology, etc. (Mintz and Brodie, 2019). Applications
      of AI systems in biomedical and clinical text processing is extensively discussed
      in Section 3.3.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 108,

      "abstract": "How can we measure the reasoning capabilities of intelligence systems?
      Visual question answering provides a convenient framework for testing the model''s
      abilities by interrogating the model through questions about the scene. However,
      despite scores of various visual QA datasets and architectures, which sometimes
      yield even a super-human performance, the question of whether those architectures
      can actually reason remains open to debate. To answer this, we extend the visual
      question answering framework and propose the following behavioral test in the
      form of a two-player game. We consider black-box neural models of CLEVR. These
      models are trained on a diagnostic dataset benchmarking reasoning. Next, we
      train an adversarial player that re-configures the scene to fool the CLEVR model.
      We show that CLEVR models, which otherwise could perform at a human level, can
      easily be fooled by our agent. Our results put in doubt whether data-driven
      approaches can do reasoning without exploiting the numerous biases that are
      often present in those datasets. Finally, we also propose a controlled experiment
      measuring the efficiency of such models to learn and perform reasoning.", "venue":

      "The main goal of this master''s thesis is to introduce Quantum Natural Language
      Processing (QNLP) in a way understandable by both the NLP engineer and the quantum

      aims at representing sentences'' meaning as vectors encoded into quantum computers.
      To achieve this, the distributional meaning of words is extended by the compositional
      meaning of sentences (DisCoCat model) : the vectors representing words'' meanings
      are composed through the syntactic structure of the sentence. This is done using
      an algorithm based on tensor products. We see that this algorithm is inefficient
      on classical computers but scales well using quantum circuits. After exposing
      the practical details of its implementation, we go through three use-cases.",

      "Target tracking, the essential ability of the human visual system, has been
      simulated by computer vision tasks. However, existing trackers perform well
      in austere experimental environments but fail in challenges like occlusion and
      fast motion. The massive gap indicates that researches only measure tracking
      performance rather than intelligence. How to scientifically judge the intelligence
      level of trackers Distinct from decision-making problems, lacking three requirements
      (a challenging task, a fair environment, and a scientific evaluation procedure)
      makes it strenuous to answer the question. In this article, we first propose
      the global instance tracking (GIT) task, which is supposed to search an arbitrary
      user-specified instance in a video without any assumptions about camera or motion
      consistency, to model the human visual tracking ability. Whereafter, we construct
      a high-quality and large-scale benchmark VideoCube to create a challenging environment.
      Finally, we design a scientific evaluation procedure using human capabilities
      as the baseline to judge tracking intelligence. Additionally, we provide an
      online platform with toolkit and an updated leaderboard. Although the experimental
      results indicate a definite gap between trackers and humans, we expect to take
      a step forward to generate authentic human-like trackers. The database, toolkit,
      evaluation server, and baseline results are available at http://videocube.aitestunion.com.",

      a property that can be used both to deceive people that a robot is more intelligent
      than it is or to facilitate the natural communication with humans. Over the
      years, different criteria have guided the design of intelligent systems, ranging
      from attempts to produce human-like language to trying to make a robot look
      like an actual human. We outline some relevant historical developments that
      all rely on different forms of mimicry of human life or intelligence. Many such
      approaches have been to some extent successful. However, we want to argue that
      there are ways to exploit aspects of life-likeness without deception. A life-like
      robot has advantages in communicating with humans, not because we believe it
      to be alive, but rather because we react instinctively to certain aspects of
      life-like behavior as this can make a robot easier to understand and allows
      us to better predict its actions. Although there may be reasons for trying to
      design robots that look exactly like humans for specific research purposes,
      we argue that it is subtle behavioral cues that are important for understandable
      robots rather than life-likeness in itself. To this end, we are developing a
      humanoid robot that will be able to show human-like movements while still looking
      decidedly robotic, thus exploiting the our ability to understand the behaviors
      of other people based on their movements.", "venue": "Frontiers in Human Dynamics",

      has emerged as a useful predictive tool based on mathematical and statistical

      monitoring (SHM) and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods with ML algorithms
      has yielded beneficial results in addressing the damage state of a material
      or system. Damage state descriptions addressed with ML include detecting a damage
      mechanism, locating a mechanism, identifying the type of mechanism, assessing
      the extent of the damage mechanism, and estimating the useful remaining life
      of a material or system. Damage evaluation research of composite materials has
      progressed with the increased usage of composite structural elements in the
      aerospace industry. NDE methods are a viable candidate for pairing with ML algorithms
      to improve damage state monitoring of composite materials due to the complexity
      associated with the structure of composites. Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP),
      for example, contain at least two constituent materials a fiber and matrix material
      whose mechanical behavior and interactions contribute to the performance of
      an FRP. Unlike conventional composite analytical models that require explicit

      the type of data selected when applying an ML model for trend analysis, anomaly
      detection, or prediction making. However, no one specific input feature is required
      for utilizing an ML model, and examples of possible data features include material
      properties, physical dimensions, and collected evaluation data. In the present
      review, applications of ML combined with the damage state evaluation of composite
      materials, particularly examining FRPs, are discussed to demonstrate the predictive
      capabilities of ML and its viability for future applications, especially in
      industrial environments, to minimize costs and improve damage detection rates.",

      "title": "A Systematic Quality Scoring Analysis to Assess Automated Cardiovascular
      Magnetic Resonance Segmentation Algorithms", "abstract": "Background The quantitative
      measures used to assess the performance of automated methods often do not reflect
      the clinical acceptability of contouring. A quality-based assessment of automated
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) segmentation more relevant to clinical practice
      is therefore needed. Objective We propose a new method for assessing the quality
      of machine learning (ML) outputs. We evaluate the clinical utility of the proposed
      method as it is employed to systematically analyse the quality of an automated
      contouring algorithm. Methods A dataset of short-axis (SAX) cine CMR images
      from a clinically heterogeneous population (n = 217) were manually contoured
      by a team of experienced investigators. On the same images we derived automated
      contours using a ML algorithm. A contour quality scoring application randomly
      presented manual and automated contours to four blinded clinicians, who were
      asked to assign a quality score from a predefined rubric. Firstly, we analyzed
      the distribution of quality scores between the two contouring methods across
      all clinicians. Secondly, we analyzed the interobserver reliability between
      the raters. Finally, we examined whether there was a variation in scores based
      on the type of contour, SAX slice level, and underlying disease. Results The
      overall distribution of scores between the two methods was significantly different,
      with automated contours scoring better than the manual (OR (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07\u20131.28),
      p = 0.001; n = 9401). There was substantial scoring agreement between raters
      for each contouring method independently, albeit it was significantly better
      for automated segmentation (automated: AC2 = 0.940, 95% CI, 0.937\u20130.943
      vs manual: AC2 = 0.934, 95% CI, 0.931\u20130.937; p = 0.006). Next, the analysis
      of quality scores based on different factors was performed. Our approach helped
      identify trends patterns of lower segmentation quality as observed for left
      ventricle epicardial and basal contours with both methods. Similarly, significant
      differences in quality between the two methods were also found in dilated cardiomyopathy
      and hypertension. Conclusions Our results confirm the ability of our systematic
      scoring analysis to determine the clinical acceptability of automated contours.
      This approach focused on the contours'' clinical utility could ultimately improve
      clinicians'' confidence in artificial intelligence and its acceptability in
      the clinical workflow.", "venue": "Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine", "year":

      "Artificial emotional intelligence refers to technologies that perform, recognise,
      or record affective states. More than merely a technological function, however,
      it is also a social process whereby cultural assumptions about what emotions
      are and how they are made are translated into composites of code, software,
      and mechanical platforms that operationalise certain models of emotion over
      others. This essay illustrates how aspects of cultural difference are both incorporated
      and elided in projects that equip machines with emotional intelligence. It does
      so by comparing the field of affective computing, which emerged in the North-Atlantic
      in the 1990s, with kansei (affective) engineering, which developed in Japan
      in the 1980s. It then leverages this comparison to argue for more diverse applications
      of the culture concept in both the development and critique of systems with
      artificial emotional intelligence. Issue 1 This article belongs to Concepts

      and dynamics whose interconnections and interdependencies increase exponentially
      each day, we are passing through an extremely delicate and complex phase of
      global mutation. What we are witnessing is a radical overturn of the complex
      interaction between natural (biological) and cultural evolution. The ongoing
      paradigm shift and profound anthropological transformation create new dimensions,
      openings, epistemological implications that require new thinking and new thought,
      as well as different approaches and methods. We are the constitutive elements
      of a \u201cnew\u201d Nature, from a structural, ontological and substantial
      point of view, in need of a New Humanism that must re-define certain categories
      (humanity, identity, dignity, Person, values, rights, etc.) in order to succeed
      in rethinking \u201cbeing human\u201d within a renewed and complex relationship
      with the ecosystems. The grand illusions of the hypertechnological civilization:
      rationality, control, measurability, predictability, and elimination of error;
      are reinforced systematically by the carte blanche delegated to technique/technology,
      reintroducing reductionist and deterministic approaches, analyses and explanations,
      exclusively based on technical knowledge and skills: that is, those which are
      guaranteed to best support precisely these very illusions. It is precisely this
      attitude which prevents us from being prepared, which dooms us to an eternal
      apprehension of black swans, little aware that our very lives are emergency;
      that they are infinite sequences of black swans. The present-day obsession with
      doing, designing, studying, and funding only what is \u201cuseful,\u201d the
      insistent search for control and certainty in order to cling onto an illusory
      sensation of familiarity and reassurance in the face of the radical unpredictability
      and variability inherent to life and reality (\u201ctyranny of concreteness\u201d).
      With the advent of artificial intelligence, it has become of the utmost importance
      to reflect upon the relationship/interaction between man and machine, and the
      dangers posed by pursuing the simulation of human thought.", "venue": "World

      In the present study, 120 panoramic X-rays (OPGs) were randomly selected from
      the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Sciences of Sapienza University of
      Rome, Italy. The OPGs were acquired and analyzed using Apox, which takes a panoramic
      X-rayand automatically returns the dental formula, the presence of dental implants,
      prosthetic crowns, fillings and root remnants. A descriptive analysis was performed
      presenting the categorical variables as absolute and relative frequencies. Results:
      In total, the number of true positive (TP) values was 2.195 (19.06%); true negative
      (TN), 8.908 (77.34%); false positive (FP), 132 (1.15%); and false negative (FN),
      283 (2.46%). The overall sensitivity was 0.89, while the overall specificity

      a text based on a predefined guideline is an interesting but challenging problem.
      A series of studies have been carried out in recent years. In dialogue systems,
      researchers have explored driving a dialogue based on a plan, while in story
      generation, a storyline has also been proved to be useful. In this article,
      we address a new task\u2014generating movie scripts based on a predefined narrative.
      As an early exploration, we study this problem in a \u201cretrieval-based\u201d
      setting. We propose a model (ScriptWriter-CPre) to select the best response
      (i.e., next script line) among the candidates that fit the context (i.e., previous
      script lines) as well as the given narrative. Our model can keep track of what
      in the narrative has been said and what is to be said. Besides, it can also
      predict which part of the narrative should be paid more attention to when selecting
      the next line of script. In our study, we find the narrative plays a different
      role than the context. Therefore, different mechanisms are designed for deal
      with them. Due to the unavailability of data for this new application, we construct
      a new large-scale data collection GraphMovie from a movie website where end-users
      can upload their narratives freely when watching a movie. This new dataset is
      made available publicly to facilitate other studies in text generation under
      the guideline. Experimental results on the dataset show that our proposed approach
      based on narratives significantly outperforms the baselines that simply use
      the narrative as a kind of context.", "venue": "ACM Trans. Inf. Syst.", "year":

      Finding the answer to audit question based on the knowledge graph can improve

      triples. These triples are stored in the Neo4j graph database as Knowledge Graph.
      In addition, this paper makes templates to generate a question answering dataset
      about electric power audits. According to the audit knowledge graph, a character-level
      convolutional neural network is trained and an intelligent audit question answering

      emerge? By engaging with such questions, this paper provides a critical intervention
      into techno-Orientalist discourse that often focuses on the dehumanization of
      Asian bodies subjugated as robots and other machines. Techno-Orientalist critique
      is limited, I contend, when it assumes to resuscitate a universalized notion

      that combines spatial or cognitive puzzles with jumps across platforms as in

      "ABSTRACT Personal Intelligent Agents (PIAs), such as Apple\u2019s Siri and
      Amazon\u2019s Alexa, are different from traditional information systems. They
      possess unique design features and are increasingly available through various
      technological devices. Due to PIAs\u2019 relative novelty, little is known about
      the determinants of their continued use. An investigation into PIAs\u2019 characteristics
      and their impact on users\u2019 post-adoption evaluations is expected to have
      theoretical and practical implications for PIA design and sustained usage. Our
      research model integrates perceptions of intelligence, anthropomorphism, and
      self-extension into the unified model of information technology continuance.
      Our findings show the key role of perceived intelligence of the PIA on continuance
      intention and indicate that hedonic perceptions of the agent become less important
      during post-adoption. Our results also highlight the role of perceived ownership
      and personalisation as antecedents of perceived self-extension.", "venue": "European

      for the formation of cognitive abilities through postnatal interactions with
      the physical and socio-cultural environment. Here, we introduce a three-level
      computational model of information processing and acquisition of cognitive abilities.
      We propose minimal architectural requirements to build these levels and how
      the parameters affect their performance and relationships. The first sensorimotor
      level handles local nonconscious processing, here during a visual classification
      task. The second level or cognitive level globally integrates the information
      from multiple local processors via long-ranged connections and synthesizes it
      in a global, but still nonconscious manner. The third and cognitively highest
      level handles the information globally and consciously. It is based on the Global
      Neuronal Workspace (GNW) theory and is referred to as conscious level. We use
      trace and delay conditioning tasks to, respectively, challenge the second and
      third levels. Results first highlight the necessity of epigenesis through selection
      and stabilization of synapses at both local and global scales to allow the network
      to solve the first two tasks. At the global scale, dopamine appears necessary
      to properly provide credit assignment despite the temporal delay between perception
      and reward. At the third level, the presence of interneurons becomes necessary
      to maintain a self-sustained representation within the GNW in the absence of
      sensory input. Finally, while balanced spontaneous intrinsic activity facilitates
      epigenesis at both local and global scales, the balanced excitatory-inhibitory
      ratio increases performance. Finally, we discuss the plausibility of the model
      in both neurodevelopmental and artificial intelligence terms.", "venue": "bioRxiv",

      computer science models, and neurosciences for theorizing, investigating, and
      simulating neural systems involved in the development, structure, physiology,
      and cognitive abilities of the brain. Computational models constitute a major
      stake in translational neuroscience: the analytical understanding of these models
      seems fundamental to consider a translation towards clinical applications. Method:
      We propose a minimal typology of computational models, which allows distinguishing
      between more realistic models (e.g., mechanistic models) and pragmatic models
      (e.g., phenomenological models). Result: Understanding the translational aspects
      of computational models goes far beyond the intrinsic characteristics of models.
      First, we assume that a computational model is rarely uniquely mechanistic or
      phenomenological. Idealization seems necessary because of i) the researcher\u2019s
      perspectives on the phenomena and the purposes of the study (i.e., by the relativity
      of the model); ii) The complexity of reality across different levels and therefore
      the nature and number of dimensions required to consider a phenomenon. Especially,
      the use of models goes far beyond their function, and requires considering external
      characteristics rooted in path dependence, interdisciplinarity, and pluralism
      in neurosciences. Conclusion: The unreasonable use of computational models,
      which are highly complex and subject to a shift in their initial function, could
      be limited by bringing to light such factors.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      (AI) is the most revolutionizing development in the health care industry in
      the current decade, with diagnostic imaging having the greatest share in such
      development. Machine learning and deep learning (DL) are subclasses of AI that
      show breakthrough performance in image analysis. They have become the state
      of the art in the field of image classification and recognition. Machine learning
      deals with the extraction of the important characteristic features from images,
      whereas DL uses neural networks to solve such problems with better performance.
      In this review, we discuss the current applications of machine learning and
      DL in the field of diagnostic radiology. Deep learning applications can be divided
      into medical imaging analysis and applications beyond analysis. In the field
      of medical imaging analysis, deep convolutional neural networks are used for
      image classification, lesion detection, and segmentation. Also used are recurrent
      neural networks when extracting information from electronic medical records
      and to augment the use of convolutional neural networks in the field of image
      classification. Generative adversarial networks have been explicitly used in
      generating high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance images
      and to map computed tomography images from the corresponding magnetic resonance
      imaging. Beyond image analysis, DL can be used for quality control, workflow
      organization, and reporting. In this article, we review the most current AI
      models used in medical imaging research, providing a brief explanation of the
      various models described in the literature within the past 5 years. Emphasis
      is placed on the various DL models, as they are the most state-of-art in imaging

      "abstract": "This paper proposes an account of neurocognitive activity without
      leveraging the notion of neural representation. Neural representation is a concept
      that results from assuming that the properties of the models used in computational
      cognitive neuroscience (e.g., information, representation, etc.) must literally
      exist the system being modelled (e.g., the brain). Computational models are
      important tools to test a theory about how the collected data (e.g., behavioural
      or neuroimaging) has been generated. While the usefulness of computational models
      is unquestionable, it does not follow that neurocognitive activity should literally
      entail the properties construed in the model (e.g., information, representation).
      While this is an assumption present in computationalist accounts, it is not
      held across the board in neuroscience. In the last section, the paper offers
      a dynamical account of neurocognitive activity with Dynamical Causal Modelling
      (DCM) that combines dynamical systems theory (DST) mathematical formalisms with
      the theoretical contextualisation provided by Embodied and Enactive Cognitive
      Science (EECS).", "venue": "Frontiers in Psychology", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

      "Abstract This article teases out the ramifications of artificial intelligence
      (AI) use in the credit analysis process by banks and other financing institutions.
      The unique features of AI models, coupled with the expansion of computing power,
      make new sources of information (big data) available for creditworthiness assessments.
      Combined, the use of AI and big data can capture weak signals, whether in the
      form of interactions or non-linearities between explanatory variables that appear
      to yield prediction improvements over conventional measures of creditworthiness.
      At the macroeconomic level, this translates into positive estimates for economic
      growth. On a micro scale, instead, the use of AI in credit analysis improves
      financial inclusion and access to credit for traditionally underserved borrowers.
      However, AI-based credit analysis processes raise enduring concerns due to potential
      biases and ethical, legal, and regulatory problems. These limits call for the
      establishment of a new generation of financial regulation introducing the certification
      of AI algorithms and of data used by banks.", "venue": "Cogent Economics & Finance",

      "Recent advances in deep learning have led to a paradigm shift in the field
      of reversible steganography. A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography
      is predictive modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks. However,
      non-trivial errors exist in inferences about some out-of-distribution and noisy
      data. In view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive
      models based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning, thereby
      creating an adaptive steganographic system. Most modern deep-learning models
      are regarded as deterministic because they only offer predictions while failing
      to provide uncertainty measurement. Bayesian neural networks bring a probabilistic
      perspective to deep learning and can be regarded as self-aware intelligent machinery;
      that is, a machine that knows its own limitations. To quantify uncertainty,
      we apply Bayesian statistics to model the predictive distribution and approximate
      it through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic forward passes. We further show
      that predictive uncertainty can be disentangled into aleatoric and epistemic
      uncertainties and these quantities can be learnt unsupervised. Experimental
      results demonstrate an improvement delivered by Bayesian uncertainty analysis
      upon steganographic rate-distortion performance.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year":

      paper aims to explore employee perceptions of companies engaged in services
      and banking of the role of change leadership on the application of artificial
      intelligence (AI) that will impact the performance and work engagement in conditions
      that are experiencing rapid changes.Design/methodology/approachThis study has
      used a quantitative research approach, and data analysis uses an approach structural
      equation modeling (SEM) supported by program computer software AMOS 22.0. A
      total of 357 respondents were involved in this study, but only 254 were qualified.
      In this study, the respondent is an employee of companies engaged in the services
      and banking sector in the East Java, Indonesia region.FindingsThe results reveal
      that AI has a significant positive effect on employee performance and work engagement.
      Change leadership positively moderates the influence of AI on employee performance
      and work engagement.Originality/valueThe development of this model has a novelty
      by including the moderating variable of the role of change leadership because,
      in conditions that are experiencing rapid changes, the role of leaders is essential.
      After all, leaders are decision-makers in the organization. The development
      of this concept focuses on studies of companies engaged in services and banking.
      Employee performance is an essential determinant in the organization because
      it will improve organizational performance. In addition, the application of
      AI in organizations will experience turmoil, so that the critical role of leaders
      is needed to achieve success with employee work engagement.", "venue": "International

      "abstract": "This article is a critical genealogy of Tay, an artificial-intelligence
      chatbot that Microsoft released on Twitter in 2016, which was quickly hijacked
      by internet trolls to reproduce racist, misogynist, and antisemitic language.
      Tay\u2019s repetition and production of hate speech calls for an approach that
      draws on both media and cultural theory\u2014the Frankfurt School\u2019s dialectical
      analyses of language and ideology, in particular. Revisiting the Frankfurt School
      in the age of algorithmic reason shows that, contrary to views foundational
      to computing, a neural-network chatbot like Tay does not sidestep meaning but
      rather carries and alters it, with unforeseen social and political consequences.
      A return to the work of Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno thus locates ideology
      in the digital world at the nexus of language\u2019s ability to mean, language
      and meaning\u2019s susceptibility to computation, and the design of a machine
      to compute both. Coming to critical terms with the antisemitism produced in
      Tay\u2019s human-computer synthesis requires, as this article contends, addressing
      the uncanny embodiment and reflection of thought that is digital computation.",

      "title": "The Thick Machine: Anthropological AI between explanation and explication",
      "abstract": "According to Clifford Geertz, the purpose of anthropology is not
      to explain culture but to explicate it. That should cause us to rethink our
      relationship with machine learning. It is, we contend, perfectly possible that
      machine learning algorithms, which are unable to explain, and could even be
      unexplainable themselves, can still be of critical use in a process of explication.
      Thus, we report on an experiment with anthropological AI. From a dataset of
      175K Facebook comments, we trained a neural network to predict the emoji reaction
      associated with a comment and asked a group of human players to compete against
      the machine. We show that a) the machine can reach the same (poor) accuracy
      as the players (51%), b) it fails in roughly the same ways as the players, and
      c) easily predictable emoji reactions tend to reflect unambiguous situations
      where interpretation is easy. We therefore repurpose the failures of the neural
      network to point us to deeper and more ambiguous situations where interpretation
      is hard and explication becomes both necessary and interesting. We use this
      experiment as a point of departure for discussing how experiences from anthropology,
      and in particular the tension between formalist ethnoscience and interpretive
      thick description, might contribute to debates about explainable AI.", "venue":

      "title": "Crowd-Sourced Identification of Characteristics of Collective Human
      Motion", "abstract": "Abstract Crowd simulations are used extensively to study
      the dynamics of human collectives. Such studies are underpinned by specific
      movement models, which encode rules and assumptions about how people navigate
      a space and handle interactions with others. These models often give rise to
      macroscopic simulated crowd behaviours that are statistically valid, but which
      lack the noisy microscopic behaviours that are the signature of believable real
      crowds. In this article, we use an existing Turing test for crowds to identify
      realistic features of real crowds that are generally omitted from simulation
      models. Our previous study using this test established that untrained individuals
      have difficulty in classifying movies of crowds as real or simulated, and that
      such people often have an idealised view of how crowds move. In this follow-up
      study (with new participants) we perform a second trial, which now includes
      a training phase (showing participants movies of real crowds). We find that
      classification performance significantly improves after training, confirming
      the existence of features that allow participants to identify real crowds. High-performing
      individuals are able to identify the features of real crowds that should be
      incorporated into future simulations if they are to be considered realistic.",

      drug repurposing has emerged as a promising strategy. In the significant data
      era, artificial intelligence (AI) and network medicine provide cutting-edge
      information science applications to define disease, medicine, therapeutics,
      and identify targets with the smallest error. We present guidelines for using
      AI to accelerate drug repurposing or repositioning, for which AI approaches
      are formidable and required in this Review. We discuss how to use AI models
      in precision medicine, such as how AI models can accelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing.
      Rapidly developing, powerful, and innovative AI and network medicine technologies
      can help to accelerate therapeutic development. This Review makes a strong case
      for using artificial intelligence-powered assistive tools to reptupose medications
      for human disease, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "venue": "Journal

      this era of technological advances, text-based music recommendations are much
      needed as they will help humans relieve stress with soothing music according
      to their moods. In this project, we have implemented a chatbot that recommends
      music based on the user''s text tone. By analyzing the tone of the text expressed
      by the user, we can identify the mood. Once the mood is identified, the application
      will play songs in the form of a web page based on the user''s choice as well
      as his current mood. In our proposed system, themain goal is to reliably determine
      a user''s mood based on their text tone with an application that can be installed
      on the user''s desktop. In today''s world, human computer interaction (HCI)
      plays a crucial role, and the most popular concept in HCI is recognition of
      emotion from text. As part of this process, the frontal view of the user''s
      text is used to determine the mood. The extraction of text tone from the user''s
      text is anotherimportant aspect. We have used IBM Analyser to check the text
      tone of the user and to predict the mood based on the text of the user, and
      Last.FM API to recommend songs based on themood of the user. Keywords: Introduction,

      than 300 animal species mentioned in his extant prose fiction. To inspire further
      research, the article lists Nabokov''s 300 animal species in seven taxonomic
      classes and references the novels and novellas in which they appear. The list
      itself is an argument for the specificity and variety of Nabokov''s writing,
      a testament to his tendency to meticulously label and categorize phenomena,
      and evidence of Nabokov''s expansive interest in non-human animals. The list
      is also an argument for reading across Nabokov''s works to identify characteristics
      that are otherwise difficult to see from focusing on a single work. While all
      of Nabokov''s fictions have a range of animal species, the extraordinary range
      and biodiversity of Nabokov''s fauna is only apparent from a macroscopic perspective.

      of Hepatic Steatosis: A Scoping Review (Preprint)", "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease linked to an increased risk of morbidity and
      mortality in afflicted individuals. Non-invasive liver imaging technologies
      such ultrasound (US) is the preferable method for screening hepatic steatosis
      because to its non-invasiveness, cheap cost, and widespread availability.\nArtificial
      intelligence (AI), in particular deep learning algorithms, has garnered widespread
      notice for its superior performance on image identification and quantification.
      They are capable of quantitatively assessing complicated medical image properties
      automatically and achieving better diagnostic accuracy while increasing efficiency.
      AI is frequently utilized and gaining popularity in the field of liver medical
      imaging, which includes radiology, nuclear medicine and ultrasound. AI can assist
      physicians in making more accurate and reproducible imaging diagnoses while
      also reducing the workload of physicians.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The primary purpose
      of this work was to conduct a scoping review of artificial intelligence technologies
      for hepatic steatosis detection and quantification. It also aimed to explore
      the role of AI technologies on Ultrasonography for the detection and quantification
      of hepatic steatosis.\n \n \n METHODS\n The researcher searched several electronic
      bibliographies including Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO,
      ACM Digital, IEEEXplore, and Scopus. The references retrieved were investigated
      for additional relevant studies through the backward and forward reference list
      checking strategy. One reviewer carried out the studies selection and data extraction.\n
      \n \n RESULTS\n A total of 718 publications were retrieved; 268 duplicates were
      removed. After scanning the titles and abstracts, 234 were excluded. After scanning
      the full texts, many articles were excluded for the following reasons: studies
      focusing on diseases other than liver parenchymal diseases (n = 39), studies
      that did not confirm the specified outcomes or confirmation study population
      (n = 58), studies that were not original research, i.e., reviews, editorials
      (n = 106), and studies not written in English (n = 8). The qualitative analysis
      comprised a total of 25 publications.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n This review illustrates
      the potential for AI systems to aid in the diagnosis and stage of liver fibrosis
      and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. By incorporating AI into established
      noninvasive methods, effective diagnostic tools with an ideal mix of sensitivity
      and specificity are created. Before adopting these AI-assisted systems in clinical
      practice, it is necessary to validate these models in additional independent
      cohorts.\n", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 53, "citationCount":

      challenge of believability in multiplayer video games. Our contribution is a
      system for assessing the believability of computer players. The state of the
      art examines existing methods and identifies seven distinguishing features that
      differ considerably from one assessment to the next. Our investigation reveals
      that assessment procedures typically alter gameplay, posing a considerable danger
      of bias. This is a major flaw since computer players are evaluated in a specific
      context rather than in the context of the game as it should be played, potentially
      skewing the findings of the evaluation. As a result, we begin on a trial-and-error
      process, with each new proposal building on the achievements of the previous
      one while removing the flaws. New proposals are tested with new assessments,
      a total of three experiments are then presented. We created a computer program
      that partially automates the execution of the assessment procedure, making these
      trials easier to implement. At the end, thanks to our proposal, gamers can assess
      the believability of computer players indirectly by employing reporting forms
      that alert users to the presence of bots. We assume that the more a bot is reported,
      the less credible it becomes. We ran a final experiment to test our proposal,

      Artificial intelligence is used both in medical research and on patients via
      medical devices. The aim of this paper is to examine and compare English and
      Taiwanese tort laws in relation to medical artificial intelligence. Methods:
      The methodologies employed are legal doctrinal analysis and comparative law
      analysis. Results: The investigation finds that English tort law treats wrong
      diagnostic or wrong advice as negligent misstatement, and mishaps due to devices
      as a physical tort under the negligence rule. Negligent misstatement may occur
      in diagnosis or advisory systems, while a negligent act may occur in products
      used in the treatment of the patient. Product liability under English common
      law applies the same rule as negligence. In Taiwan, the general principles of
      tort law in Taiwan\u2019s Civil Code for misstatement and negligent action apply,
      whereas the Consumer Protection Act provides for additional rules on product
      liability of traders. Conclusions: Safety regulations may be a suitable alternative
      to tort liability as a means to ensure the safety of medical artificial intelligence

      Los robos est\u00e1n destinados a tareas repetitivas, riesgosas o de precisi\u00f3n,
      en las que pueden superar las limitaciones humanas, no percibi\u00e9ndose conflictos
      \u00e9ticos aunque s\u00ed nuevos desaf\u00edos en la organizaci\u00f3n social.
      Respecto de los androides, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus capacidades, habr\u00e1
      que considerar los efectos que puedan ocurrir en el ser humano durante la interacci\u00f3n

      have dramatic disagreements about the extension of their object of study, cognition.
      This paper defends a novel analysis of the scientific concept of cognition:
      that cognition is the sensitive management of an agent\u2019s behavior. This
      analysis is \u201cmodular,\u201d so that its extension varies depending on how
      one interprets certain of its constituent terms. I argue that these variations

      care", "abstract": "The 2020 coronavirus pandemic served to remind us that despite
      our Cartesian fantasies of control, naturing nature (natura naturans) is still
      active in the form of an untamed Other. The dominant reaction on most political
      sides was anthropocentric: if we do something \u2013 a doing generally framed
      within the scope of technique and management \u2013 nature shall go back to
      the kind and submissive non-viral neutrality that we appreciate in \u2018her\u2019
      as a supposedly passive resource for productivism. How could humanity \u2013
      a pandemic species itself and not only metaphorically \u2013 be better attuned
      with the powers of naturing nature, in a posture of co-creation rather than
      of a reactive technocratic war against the non-periodic or \u2018monstrous\u2019
      aspects of life? This question is a matter of philosophical health: the future
      of humanity does not depend on statistics and logistics, but on the possibility
      of a philosophical (re)generative politics, a trustful care for creative singularity
      rather than an anxious control and production of regularity. Humanity\u2019s
      collective health presupposes this reconciliation with naturing nature and the
      deployment of a global shared cosmology based on the creative healing-growth
      flux of originative creativity. This regenerative and life-affirming creative
      Real is here termed \u2018Creal\u2019, and we call \u2018crealectics\u2019 the
      generative philosophical health that favours healing growth.", "venue": "Acta

      the Upper Cortical Layers", "abstract": "Spatio-temporal brain activity monitored
      by EEG recordings in humans and other mammals has identified beta/gamma oscillations
      (20\u201380 Hz), which are self-organized into spatio-temporal structures recurring
      at theta/alpha rates (4\u201312 Hz). These structures have statistically significant
      correlations with sensory stimuli and reinforcement contingencies perceived
      by the subject. The repeated collapse of self-organized structures at theta/alpha
      rates generates laterally propagating phase gradients (phase cones), ignited
      at some specific location of the cortical sheet. Phase cones have been interpreted
      as neural signatures of transient perceptual experiences according to the cinematic
      theory of brain dynamics. The rapid expansion of essentially isotropic phase
      cones is consistent with the propagation of perceptual broadcasts postulated
      by Global Workspace Theory (GWT). What is the evolutionary advantage of brains
      operating with repeatedly collapsing dynamics? This question is answered using
      thermodynamic concepts. According to neuropercolation theory, waking brains
      are described as non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems operating at the edge
      of criticality, undergoing repeated phase transitions. This work analyzes the
      role of long-range axonal connections and metabolic processes in the regulation
      of critical brain dynamics. Historically, the near 10 Hz domain has been associated
      with conscious sensory integration, cortical \u201cignitions\u201d linked to
      conscious visual perception, and conscious experiences. We can therefore combine
      a very large body of experimental evidence and theory, including graph theory,
      neuropercolation, and GWT. This cortical operating style may optimize a tradeoff
      between rapid adaptation to novelty vs. stable and widespread self-organization,
      therefore resulting in significant Darwinian benefits.", "venue": "Frontiers

      will one day inhabit our physical spaces, sense the world as we do, assist our
      physical labours, and communicate with us through natural language. Here we
      study how to design artificial agents that can interact naturally with humans
      using the simplification of a virtual environment. We show that imitation learning
      of human-human interactions in a simulated world, in conjunction with self-supervised
      learning, is sufficient to produce a multimodal interactive agent, which we
      call MIA, that successfully interacts with non-adversarial humans 75% of the
      time. We further identify architectural and algorithmic techniques that improve
      performance, such as hierarchical action selection. Altogether, our results
      demonstrate that imitation of multi-modal, real-time human behaviour may provide
      a straightforward and surprisingly effective means of imbuing agents with a
      rich behavioural prior from which agents might then be fine-tuned for specific
      purposes, thus laying a foundation for training capable agents for interactive
      robots or digital assistants. A video of MIA''s behaviour may be found at https://youtu.be/ZFgRhviF7mY",

      "title": "The Burst Market: the Next Leap for Humanity", "abstract": "Humans
      have a major challenge: how to share knowledge effectively. People often need
      quick informational help, and meanwhile are often able to offer help. Let alone
      professional insights, knowledge common to some is frequently needed by others.
      However, rapid advice among strangers is rarely offered in reality. This signifies
      a critical issue: the current labor market, called by this paper the Conventional
      Market (CM), massively fails such Burst Jobs, leading to huge job opportunity
      losses and human intelligence underutilization. This paper attributes the failure
      to high transaction costs due to technology constraints. Thus, this paper proposes
      creating an online Burst Market (BM) letting people sell any services at their
      own rate via video or audio chats lasting as short as a few seconds or minutes.
      Empowering all people with enormous job creation, the BM will aid in poverty
      lifting, alleviate aging society problem, reduce AI-led unemployment, maximize
      human values with Life-Long Working, and increase prosperity and human achievements.
      The BM will also reshape industries, and may cause a global power reshuffle
      or even the ultimate destruction of nations. In short, this paper proposes the
      concept of the BM and demonstrates that it will provide a major leap for humanity.",

      the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to structural glass engineering
      and glass industry audience. The first part of the paper is concerned with lying
      nomenclature and theory foundation of AI and its subclasses of Machine and Deep
      Learning (ML/DL), elaborating the specific needs and requirements for the application
      in a structural glass context. A subsequent section explores applications of
      AI for different subjects within the production and quality assessment of glass
      products as well as the design, verification and monitoring of facades and glass
      structures. This paper presents successfully conducted industry projects by
      the authors, which are: supervised ML for material parameter identification
      of polymeric interlayers used in laminated glass, the prediction of sound insulation
      properties of insulation glass units and glass laminates and the application
      of computer vision DL methods to image classification of the Pummel test. A
      visionary outlook highlights how to use AI for future generative design and
      verification of glass structures for rapid collaborative prototyping. The summary
      and conclusion section wraps up the main findings for the applicability and
      impact of AI for the presented structural glass research and industry problems.
      This paper shows, that already by today in many cases AI, data, software and

      "title": "Improving Customer Service Chatbots with Attention-based Transfer
      Learning", "abstract": "With growing societal acceptance and increasing cost
      efficiency due to mass production, service robots are beginning to cross from
      the industrial to the social domain. Currently, customer service robots tend
      to be digital and emulate social interactions through on-screen text, but state-of-the-art
      research points towards physical robots soon providing customer service in person.
      This article explores two possibilities. Firstly, whether transfer learning
      can aid in the improvement of customer service chatbots between business domains.
      Second, the implementation of a framework for physical robots for in-person
      interaction. Modelled on social interaction with Twitter customer support accounts,
      transformer-based chatbot models are initially assigned to learn one domain
      from an initial random weight distribution. Given shared vocabulary, each model
      is then tasked with learning another domain by transferring knowledge from the
      previous. Following studies on 19 different businesses, results show that the
      majority of models are improved when transferring weights from at least one
      other domain, in particular those that are more data-scarce than others. General
      language transfer learning occurs, as well as higher-level transfer of similar
      domain knowledge, in several cases. The chatbots are finally implemented on
      Temi and Pepper robots, with feasibility issues encountered and solutions are
      proposed to overcome them.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "referenceCount":

      "title": "Implementing Implementation Science; A Bibliometric Study of Qualitative
      Research in Clinical Artificial Intelligence", "abstract": "\n Background\n\nImplementation
      science is a pragmatic and multidisciplinary field, centred on the application
      of a wide range of theoretical approaches to close \u2018know-do\u2019 gaps
      in healthcare. The implementation science community is made of individuals on
      a continuum between academia and practice, but it is unclear to what extent
      the theoretical deliberations of implementation academics are translated into
      the work of implementation practitioners and on to patient benefit. This bibliometric
      study aims to use the field of clinical artificial intelligence(AI) implementation
      to sample the prevalence and character of theoretically informed implementation
      practices.\nMethods\n\nQualitative research of key stakeholder perspectives
      on clinical AI published between 2014-2021 was systematically identified. Following
      title, abstract and full-text screening eligible articles were characterised
      in terms of their publication, AI tool and context studied, the theoretical
      approach if any and the research methods and quality. Descriptive, comparative
      and regression statistics were applied.\nResults\n\nOne-hundred-and-eleven studies
      met the eligibility criteria, with monthly eligible publication rate increasing
      from 0.7-4.0 between 2014-2021. Eligible studies represented 23 different nations
      and 25 different clinical specialities. A theoretical approach was explicitly
      employed in 39(35.1%) studies though 6 of these described novel theoretical
      approaches(15.1%) and the most frequently used theoretical approach was only
      used 3 times. There was no statistically significant trend in the prevalence
      of theoretically informed research within the study period. Of the 25 theoretically
      informed studies conducted in Europe or North America 19(76%) used theories
      that originated in the same continent.\nConclusions\n\nThe theoretical approaches
      which characterise implementation science are not being put to use as often
      as they could, and the means by which they are selected also seems suboptimal.
      The field may facilitate a greater synergy between theory and practice if the
      focus shifts from unifying implementation theories on to unifying and expanding
      the implementation community. By making more theoretical approaches accessible
      to practitioners and supporting their selection and application, theory could
      be more effectively harnessed to close healthcare\u2019s \u2018know-do gaps\u2019.\nProtocol

      This paper describes a prototype NLU system for Thai language based on Mental
      Image Directed Semantic Theory in order to help Thai language beginners more
      comprehensively. For the first step, Thai sentences of basic structures intended
      for amateur users were chosen for the system to process. In the system, input
      sentences are fragmented to detect constituent words and their grammatical relationships,
      and then transduced to semantic representations in a formal language named Language
      for Mental-image Description. The semantic interpretations are evaluated through
      reasoning processes such as disambiguation and entailment. Finally, the system
      returns animations as its understanding results of the inputs, in order to help
      language learners understand the text contents in a more intuitive way.", "venue":

      "title": "Avoiding adverse autonomous agent actions", "abstract": "Few today
      would dispute that the age of autonomous machines is nearly upon us (cf., Kurzweil,
      2005; Moravec, 1988), if it is not already. While it is doubtful that one can
      identify any fully autonomous machine system at this point in time, especially
      one that is openly and publicly acknowledged to be so, it is far less debatable
      that our present line of technological evolution is leading toward this eventuality
      (Endsley, 2017; Hancock, 2017a). It is this specter of the consequences of even
      existentially threatening adverse events, emanating from these penetrative autonomous
      systems, which is the focus of the present work. The impending and imperative
      question is what we intend to do about these prospective challenges? As with
      essentially all of human discourse, we can imagine two sides to this question.
      One side is represented by an optimistic vision of a near utopian future, underwritten
      by AI-support and some inherent degree of intrinsic benevolence. The opposing
      vision promulgates a dystopian nightmare in which machines have gained almost
      total ascendency and only a few \u201cplucky\u201d humans remain. The latter
      is most especially a featured trope of the human heroic narrative (Campbell,
      1949). It will be most probably the case that neither of the extremes on this
      putative spectrum of possibilities will represent the eventual reality that
      we will actually experience. However, the ground rules are now in the process
      of being set which will predispose us toward one of these directions over the
      other (Feng et al., 2016; Hancock, 2017a). Traditionally, many have approached
      this general form of technological inquiry by asking questions about strengths,
      weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. Consequently, it is within this general
      framework that this present work is offered. What follows are some overall considerations
      of the balance of the value of such autonomous systems\u2019 inauguration and
      penetration. These observations provide the bedrock from which to consider the
      specific strengths, weaknesses, threats (risks), and promises (opportunity)
      dimensions. The specific consideration of the application of the protective
      strategies of the well-known hierarchy of controls (Haddon, 1973) then acts
      as a final prefatory consideration to the concluding discussion which examines
      the adverse actions of autonomous technological systems as a potential human
      existential threat. The term autonomy is one that has been, and still currently
      is, the subject of much attention, debate, and even abuse (and see Ezenkwu &
      Starkey, 2019). To an extent, the term seems to be flexible enough to encompass
      almost whatever the proximal user requires of it. For example, a simple, descriptive
      word-cloud (Figure 1), illustrates the various terminologies that surrounds
      our present use of this focal term. It is not the present purpose here to engage
      in a long, polemic and potentially unedifying dispute specifically about the
      term\u2019s definition. This is because the present concern is with autonomous
      technological systems, and not about the greater meaning of autonomy per se,
      either as a property or as a process. The definition which is adopted here is
      that: \u201cautonomous systems are generative and learn, evolve, and permanently
      change their functional capacities as a result of the input of operational and
      contextual information. Their actions necessarily become more", "venue": "Hum.

      "title": "Introducing Variational Autoencoders to High School Students", "abstract":
      "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are a compelling way to introduce
      K-12 students to AI education using an artistic medium, and hence have drawn
      attention from K-12 AI educators. Previous Creative AI curricula mainly focus
      on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while paying less attention to Autoregressive
      Models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or other generative models, which have
      since become common in the field of generative AI. VAEs'' latent-space structure
      and interpolation ability could effectively ground the interdisciplinary learning
      of AI, creative arts, and philosophy. Thus, we designed a lesson to teach high
      school students about VAEs. We developed a web-based game and used Plato''s
      cave, a philosophical metaphor, to introduce how VAEs work. We used a Google
      Colab notebook for students to re-train VAEs with their hand-written digits
      to consolidate their understandings. Finally, we guided the exploration of creative
      VAE tools such as SketchRNN and MusicVAE to draw the connection between what
      they learned and real-world applications. This paper describes the lesson design
      and shares insights from the pilot studies with 22 students. We found that our
      approach was effective in teaching students about a novel AI concept.", "venue":

      Constructs in Human-Chatbot Interaction", "abstract": "Chatbots have long been
      advocated for computer-assisted language learning systems to support learners
      with conversational practice. A particular challenge in such systems is explaining
      mistakes stemming from ambiguous grammatical constructs. Misplaced modifiers,
      for instance, do not make sentences ungrammatical, but introduce ambiguity through
      the misplacement of an adverb or prepositional phrase. In certain cases, the
      ambiguity gives rise to humor, which can serve to illustrate the mistake itself.
      We conducted an online experiment with 400 native English speakers to explore
      the use of a chatbot to harness such humor. In an interaction resembling an
      advanced grammar exercise, the chatbot presented participants with a phrase
      containing a misplaced modifier, explained the ambiguity in the phrase, acknowledged
      (or ignored) the humor that the ambiguity gave rise to, and suggested a correction.
      Participants then completed a questionnaire, rating the chatbot with respect
      to ten traits. A quantitative analysis showed a significant increase in how
      participants rated the chatbot\u2019s personality, humor, and friendliness when
      it acknowledged the humor arising from the misplaced modifier. This effect was
      observed whether the acknowledgment was conveyed using verbal, nonverbal (emoji),
      or mixed cues.", "venue": "International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction",

      complexity has often been ignored in philosophy of mind, in philosophical artificial
      intelligence studies. The purpose of this paper is threefold. First and foremost,
      to show the importance of complexity rather than computability in philosophical
      and AI problems. Second, to rephrase the notion of computability in terms of
      solvability, i.e. treating computability as non-sufficient for establishing
      intelligence. The Church-Turing thesis is therefore revisited and rephrased
      in order to capture the ontological background of spatial and temporal complexity.
      Third, to emphasize ontological differences between different time complexities,
      which seem to provide a solid base towards better understanding of artificial
      intelligence in general.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2021, "referenceCount":

      a replication study using imitation games about religion", "abstract": "ABSTRACT
      The Imitation Game is a new method and, as such, it is important to show that
      its results are plausible and replicable. We tested this by conducting Imitation
      Games on religion in a range of European countries, returning approximately
      12 months later to repeat the research. The idea was that non-Christian members
      of strongly Christian countries would find it easy to pass as members of the
      practicing majority because Christian beliefs and practices would be ubiquitous.
      In more secular countries, the expectation was that non-Christians would find
      it harder to pass as Christian because religious practices are less visible.
      We show that, despite some anomalous results, the data are consistent with expectations
      derived from survey data and that the claim to have replicated the results can
      be supported. We also suggest that our experiences show that questions of replication
      in the social sciences cannot be resolved by statistical meta-analysis alone.",

      Gynaecology and Obstetrics \u2013 an Assessment of the State of Play", "abstract":
      "Abstract The long-awaited progress in digitalisation is generating huge amounts
      of medical data every day, and manual analysis and targeted, patient-oriented
      evaluation of this data is becoming increasingly difficult or even infeasible.
      This state of affairs and the associated, increasingly complex requirements
      for individualised precision medicine underline the need for modern software
      solutions and algorithms across the entire healthcare system. The utilisation
      of state-of-the-art equipment and techniques in almost all areas of medicine
      over the past few years has now indeed enabled automation processes to enter
      \u2013 at least in part \u2013 into routine clinical practice. Such systems
      utilise a wide variety of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the majority
      of which have been developed to optimise medical image reconstruction, noise
      reduction, quality assurance, triage, segmentation, computer-aided detection
      and classification and, as an emerging field of research, radiogenomics. Tasks
      handled by AI are completed significantly faster and more precisely, clearly
      demonstrated by now in the annual findings of the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual
      Recognition Challenge (ILSVCR), first conducted in 2015, with error rates well
      below those of humans. This review article will discuss the potential capabilities
      and currently available applications of AI in gynaecological-obstetric diagnostics.
      The article will focus, in particular, on automated techniques in prenatal sonographic
      diagnostics. Zusammenfassung Mit dem Fortschreiten der l\u00e4ngst notwendigen
      Digitalisierung werden t\u00e4glich riesige Mengen an medizinischen Daten generiert,
      deren manuelle Analyse und zielgerichtete patientenorientierte Auswertung zunehmend
      schwieriger bis unm\u00f6glich wird. Dieser Umstand und die damit verbundenen,
      immer komplexer werdenden Anforderungen an eine individualisierte Pr\u00e4zisionsmedizin
      verdeutlichen die Notwendigkeit moderner Softwarel\u00f6sungen und Algorithmen
      im gesamten Gesundheitswesen. Tats\u00e4chlich haben in den letzten Jahren in
      nahezu allen Bereichen der Medizin mit dem Einsatz modernster Apparaturen und
      Techniken nun auch automatisierte Prozessabl\u00e4ufe \u2013 zumindest teilweise
      \u2013 Einzug in die klinische Routine gehalten. Diese Systeme nutzen verschiedenste
      Anwendungen der k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und sind mehrheitlich dazu
      konzipiert worden, um die medizinische Bildrekonstruktion, Rauschunterdr\u00fcckung,
      Qualit\u00e4tssicherung, Triage, Segmentierung, computergest\u00fctzte Erkennung
      und Klassifizierung oder Radiogenomics als neuartiges Forschungsfeld zu optimieren.
      Die von der KI \u00fcbernommenen Aufgaben werden dabei deutlich schneller und
      pr\u00e4ziser erledigt, was sich sp\u00e4testens mit den j\u00e4hrlichen Auswertungen
      der ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVCR) ab 2015 mit Fehlerraten
      deutlich unterhalb der von Menschen zeigt. In diesem \u00dcbersichtsartikel
      soll auf die potenziellen M\u00f6glichkeiten und die derzeitig verf\u00fcgbaren
      Anwendungen der KI in der gyn\u00e4kologisch-geburtshilflichen Diagnostik eingegangen
      werden. Besonderes Augenmerk wird hierbei auf automatisierte Techniken in der
      pr\u00e4natalen sonografischen Diagnostik gelegt werden.", "venue": "Geburtshilfe

      As a significant part, artificial intelligence leads to a great change of our

      The new method significantly improved the accuracy although it requires the

      "title": "The twentieth century science paradoxes", "abstract": "The isolation
      of hypothetical theories from the realities of living matter has caused mysticism
      to penetrate scientific theories. With mystical thinking, the idea of using
      an analytical method to solve cognitive problems does not occur. Dialectical
      logic, in contrast to mysticism, states the opposite: any problematic tasks
      of cognizing the vital processes and phenomena of the universe are solvable
      exclusively in an analytic way, with the only method. The author created a universal
      and formal theory of solving intellectual (i.e., having no previously known
      algorithms for solving) problems associated with the knowledge of the vital
      functions of natural and man-made processes in any phenomena of the universe
      - the Kondratenko method of axiomatic modeling, the effectiveness of which is
      achieved by correctly setting the problem and solving it purely formal method.
      The correctness of the statement of the problem means, first of all, the recognition
      of the failure of all hypothetical (not confirmed by the results of full-scale
      experimentation with the subject of knowledge) theories. This requirement, in
      particular, to the mathematical tools used to solve problems of cognition, it
      revealed paradoxes in the foundations of mathematics, which are discussed in
      the article. \nAt present, in the natural and applied sciences in most publications,
      i.e. more than 90% associated with the construction of formal theories in these
      sciences, the proof of theorems is carried out: \nfirstly, in a meaningful way,
      which contradicts the urgent requirement of philosophers of science to use exclusively
      formal evidence, which is a criterion for assessing the correctness and reliability
      of evidence; \nsecondly, in substantive evidence in 95% of cases, an exclusively
      standard list of tautologies is used, which by definition is incorrect for the
      purpose of proving theorems on phenomena and processes of the universe based
      on exclusively true axioms obtained as a result of full-scale experimentation
      with these phenomena and processes. The article deals with the paradox in the
      classical approach to proving theorems, which consists in the inappropriateness
      of generally accepted stereotypical tautologies of classical mathematics for
      proving theorems.", "venue": "Transfer of innovative technologies", "year":

      distinguishes between contributory and interactional experts. Contributory experts
      have practical expertise\u2014they can \u201cwalk the walk.\u201d Interactional
      experts have internalized the tacit components of expertise\u2014they can \u201ctalk
      the talk\u201d but are not able to reliably \u201cwalk the walk.\u201d Interactional
      expertise permits effective communication between contributory experts and others
      (e.g., laypeople), which in turn facilitates working jointly toward shared goals.
      Interactional expertise is attained through long-term immersion into the expert
      community in question. To assess interactional expertise, researchers developed
      the imitation game\u2014a variant of the Turing test\u2014to test whether a
      person, or a particular group, possesses interactional expertise of another.
      The imitation game, which has been used mainly in sociology to study the social
      nature of knowledge, may also be a useful tool for researchers who focus on
      cognitive aspects of expertise. In this paper, we introduce a modified version
      of the imitation game and apply it to examine interactional expertise in the
      context of blindness. Specifically, we examined blind and sighted individuals\u2019
      ability to imitate each other in a street-crossing scenario. In Phase I, blind
      and sighted individuals provided verbal reports of their thought processes associated
      with crossing a street\u2014once while imitating the other group (i.e., as a
      pretender) and once responding genuinely (i.e., as a non-pretender). In Phase
      II, transcriptions of the reports were judged as either genuine or imitated
      responses by a different set of blind and sighted participants, who also provided
      the reasoning for their decisions. The judges comprised blind individuals, sighted
      orientation-and-mobility specialists, and sighted individuals with infrequent
      socialization with blind individuals. Decision data were analyzed using probit
      mixed models for signal-detection-theory indices. Reasoning data were analyzed
      using natural-language-processing (NLP) techniques. The results revealed evidence
      that interactional expertise (i.e., relevant tacit knowledge) can be acquired
      by immersion in the group that possesses and produces the expert knowledge.
      The modified imitation game can be a useful research tool for measuring interactional
      expertise within a community of practice and evaluating practitioners\u2019

      "abstract": "O texto visa analisar se, dada a realidade brasileira, seria poss\u00edvel
      inserir nos contratos privados sistemas de Intelig\u00eancia Artificial - IA.
      Primeiro, ser\u00e3o analisados \u200b\u200bos conceitos existentes sobre IA,
      bem como a dificuldade em conceitu\u00e1-la de uma \u00fanica maneira. O texto
      abordar\u00e1, atrav\u00e9s do conceito de contrato, a possibilidade e as vantagens
      da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da IA nos contratos privados.\n\nTal ideia foi, primeiramente,
      publicada por Gustavo Tepedino e Rodrigo da Guia Silva que, ent\u00e3o, surgiu
      como inspira\u00e7\u00e3o para a elabora\u00e7\u00e3o do presente trabalho,
      com a proposta de tentar ir al\u00e9m.\n\nPara os autores, em sua ideia original,
      a IA poderia ser utilizada como instrumento de fixa\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os,
      proporcionando flexibilidade aos contratos, de forma a reduzir os custos de
      transa\u00e7\u00e3o dos contratos em decorr\u00eancia de eventuais fatos supervenientes.
      A IA poderia ser utilizada como forma de controle de cl\u00e1usulas de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o
      autom\u00e1tica, em que a cl\u00e1usula estabele\u00e7a o direito do vendedor
      \u00e0 revis\u00e3o do pre\u00e7o originariamente fixado caso os custos com
      insumos venham a ultrapassar certo patamar pr\u00e9-fixado.\n\nNo presente trabalho,
      se analisam outros tipos de contratos, como por exemplo os de loca\u00e7\u00e3o,
      em que no final de 2020 houve um reajuste significativo do IGPM havendo, inclusive,
      coment\u00e1rios sobre a possibilidade de reajustar os contratos. Nesse caso,
      por exemplo, a IA poderia ser de grande aux\u00edlio \u00e0s partes.", "venue":

      "abstract": "\n In multiple-choice exams, students select one answer from among
      typically four choices and can explain why they made that particular choice.
      Students are good at understanding natural language questions and based on their
      domain knowledge can easily infer the question\u2019s answer by \u201cconnecting
      the dots\u201d across various pertinent facts. Considering automated reasoning
      for elementary science question answering, we address the novel task of generating
      explanations for answers from human-authored facts. For this, we examine the
      practically scalable framework of feature-rich support vector machines leveraging
      domain-targeted, hand-crafted features. Explanations are created from a human-annotated
      set of nearly 5000 candidate facts in the WorldTree corpus. Our aim is to obtain
      better matches for valid facts of an explanation for the correct answer of a
      question over the available fact candidates. To this end, our features offer
      a comprehensive linguistic and semantic unification paradigm. The machine learning
      problem is the preference ordering of facts, for which we test pointwise regression
      versus pairwise learning-to-rank. Our contributions, originating from comprehensive
      evaluations against nine existing systems, are (1) a case study in which two
      preference ordering approaches are systematically compared, and where the pointwise
      approach is shown to outperform the pairwise approach, thus adding to the existing
      survey of observations on this topic; (2) since our system outperforms a highly-effective
      TF-IDF-based IR technique by 3.5 and 4.9 points on the development and test
      sets, respectively, it demonstrates some of the further task improvement possibilities
      (e.g., in terms of an efficient learning algorithm, semantic features) on this
      task; (3) it is a practically competent approach that can outperform some variants
      of BERT-based reranking models; and (4) the human-engineered features make it
      an interpretable machine learning model for the task.", "venue": "Natural Language

      business, yet current perceptions of the scope of this transformation may be
      myopic. Recent progress in natural language processing involving transformer
      language models (TLMs) offers a potential avenue for AI-driven business and
      societal transformation that is beyond the scope of what most currently foresee.
      We review this recent progress as well as recent literature utilizing text mining
      in top IS journals to develop an outline for how future IS research can benefit
      from these new techniques. Our review of existing IS literature reveals that
      suboptimal text mining techniques are prevalent and that the more advanced TLMs
      could be applied to enhance and increase IS research involving text data, and
      to enable new IS research topics, thus creating more value for the research
      community. This is possible because these techniques make it easier to develop
      very powerful custom systems and their performance is superior to existing methods
      for a wide range of tasks and applications. Further, multilingual language models
      make possible higher quality text analytics for research in multiple languages.
      We also identify new avenues for IS research, like language user interfaces,
      that may offer even greater potential for future IS research.", "venue": "ACM

      AI Agents", "abstract": "Critical periods are phases during which a toddler\u2019s
      brain develops in spurts. To promote children\u2019s cognitive development,
      proper guidance is critical in this stage. However, it is not clear whether
      such a critical period also exists for the training of AI agents. Similar to
      human toddlers, well-timed guidance and multimodal interactions might significantly
      enhance the training efficiency of AI agents as well. To validate this hypothesis,
      we adapt this notion of critical periods to learning in AI agents and investigate
      the critical period in the virtual environment for AI agents. We formalize the
      critical period and Toddler-guidance learning in the reinforcement learning
      (RL) framework. Then, we built up a toddler-like environment with VECA toolkit
      to mimic human toddlers\u2019 learning characteristics. We study three discrete
      levels of mutual interaction: weak-mentor guidance (sparse reward), moderate
      mentor guidance (helper-reward), and mentor demonstration (behavioral cloning).
      We also introduce the EAVE dataset consisting of 30,000 real-world images to
      fully reflect the toddler\u2019s viewpoint. We evaluate the impact of critical
      periods on AI agents from two perspectives: how and when they are guided best
      in both uni- and multimodal learning. Our experimental results show that both
      uni- and multimodal agents with moderate mentor guidance and critical period
      on 1 million and 2 million training steps show a noticeable improvement. We
      validate these results with transfer learning on the EAVE dataset and find the
      performance advancement on the same critical period and the guidance.", "venue":

      "The study of how children develop their conversational skills is an important
      scientific frontier at the crossroad of social, cognitive, and linguistic development
      with important applications in health, education, and child-oriented AI. While
      recent advances in machine learning techniques allow us to develop formal theories
      of conversational development in real-life contexts, progress has been slowed
      down by the lack of corpora that both approximate naturalistic interaction and
      provide clear access to children\u2019s non-verbal behavior in face-to-face
      conversations. This work is an effort to fill this gap. We introduce ChiCo (for
      Child Conversation), a corpus we built using an online video chat system. Using
      a weakly structured task (a word-guessing game), we recorded 20 conversations
      involving either children in middle childhood (i.e., 6 to 12 years old) interacting
      with their caregivers (condition of interest) or the same caregivers interacting
      with other adults (a control condition), resulting in 40 individual recordings.
      Our annotation of these videos has shown that the frequency of children\u2019s
      use of gaze, gesture and facial expressions mirrors that of adults. Future modeling
      research can capitalize on this rich behavioral data to study how both verbal
      and non-verbal cues contribute to the development of conversational coordination.",

      "Oncology is one of the most dynamic branches of medicine. As a result of numerous
      oncology studies, there has been a significant increase in scientific and clinical
      data that the human brain cannot store. Advances in artificial intelligence
      (AI) technology have led to its rapid clinical application. In this paper, we
      wanted to see the role of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in oncology.
      We conducted an unsystematic search of databases (Pub Med, MEDLINE, and Google
      Scholar) using the keywords: intelligence, From a large number of articles available
      to us, we singled out review articles and clinical trial results according to
      their clarity and innovation regarding the use of artificial intelligence in
      oncology. Of particular importance to us was the ability to apply their results
      in everyday clinical work. The possibilities of using artificial intelligence
      in oncology are innumerable. Thus, AI can be used for diagnostic purposes (malignant
      screening, histopathology, and molecular diagnostics), therapeutic purposes
      (personalized treatment, prediction of treatment side effects and response to
      therapy, treatment decisions) as well as for prognostic purposes (risk stratification,
      5-year survival, monitoring). The implementation of AI in clinical practice
      presents new challenges for clinicians. Namely, in the era of evidence-based
      and patient-centered medicine, they will have to master statistical as well
      as computer skills in addition to clinical ones. Therefore, it is necessary
      to start educating future doctors about the importance of AI in medicine as
      soon as possible.", "venue": "Proceedings of the International Conferences on

      machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), have been ubiquitous
      in both popular science media as well as the academic literature. Many industries
      have tried the current suite of ML and AI algorithms with various degrees of
      success. Mineral processing, as an industry, is looking at AI for two reasons.
      First of all, as with other industries, it is pertinent to know if AI algorithms
      can be used to enhance productivity. The second reason is specific to the mining
      industry. Of late, the grade of ores is reducing, and the demand for ethical
      mining (with as little effect on ecology as possible) is increasing. Thus, mineral
      processing industries also want to explore the possible use of AI in solving
      these challenges. In this review paper, first, the challenges in mineral processing
      that can potentially be solved by AI are presented. Then, some of the most pertinent
      developments in the domain of ML and AI (applied in the domain of mineral processing)
      are discussed. Lastly, a top-level modus operandi is presented for a mineral
      processing industry that might want to explore the possibilities of using AI
      in its processes. Following are some of the new paradigms added by this review.
      This review presents a holistic view of the domain of mineral processing with
      an AI lens. It is also one of the first reviews in this domain to thoroughly
      discuss the use of AI in ethical, green, and sustainable mineral processing.
      The AI process proposed in this paper is a comprehensive one. To ensure the
      relevance to industry, the flow was made agile with the spiral system engineering
      flow. This is expected to drive rapid and agile investigation of the potential
      of applying ML and AI in different mineral processing industries.", "venue":

      "abstract": "The availability of huge structured and unstructured data, advanced
      highly dense memory and high performance computing machines have provided a
      strong push for the development in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
      learning (ML) domains. AI and machine learning has rekindled the hope of efficiently
      solving complex problems which was not possible in the recent past. The generation
      and availability of big\u2010data is a strong driving force for the development
      of AI/ML applications, however, several challenges need to be addressed, like
      processing speed, memory requirement, high bandwidth, low latency memory access,
      and highly conductive and flexible connections between processing units and
      memory blocks. The conventional computing platforms are unable to address these
      issues with machine learning and AI. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely
      employed for machine learning and AI applications, like speech recognition,
      computer vison, robotics, and so forth, efficiently and accurately. However,
      accuracy is achieved at the cost of high computational complexity, sacrificing
      energy efficiency and throughput like performance measuring parameters along
      with high latency. To address the problems of latency, energy efficiency, complexity,
      power consumption, and so forth, a lot of state of the art DNN accelerators
      have been designed and implemented in the form of application specific integrated
      circuits (ASICs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This work provides
      the state of the art of all these DNN accelerators which have been developed
      recently. Various DNN architectures, their computing units, emerging technologies
      used in improving the performance of DNN accelerators will be discussed. Finally,
      we will try to explore the scope for further improvement in these accelerator
      designs, various opportunities and challenges for the future research.", "venue":

      "title": "Is Artificial Intelligence Transforming Dentistry Today?", "abstract":
      "Since the birth of science, the most fascinating structure of the human body
      is the human brain.\u00a0 Over the past centuries\u2019 researchers have been
      developing the latest technologies to imitate and explore how the human brain
      functions. However, to develop a machine that thinks like a human brain is still
      a dream for researchers. Aristotle\u2019s early efforts to devise logical thinking
      via his syllogisms (a three-part deductive reasoning) were a source of inspiration
      for modern computers and technologies1. In the1950, Alan Turing designed a machine
      to decode encrypted messages, which was a breakthrough of super computers in
      the days of yore. He designed the \u201cTuring Test\u201d which was coined to
      assess whether a computer could exhibit intelligence better known as \u201cartificial
      intelligence\u201d (AI) today2. AI is \u201ca field of science and engineering
      concerned with the computational understanding of what is commonly called intelligent
      behavior, and with the creation of artifacts that exhibit such behaviour\u201d3.
      \nSince 1980, AI has come a long way, virtual reality is being used in dental
      education these days to create real life situations and promote clinical work
      on simulators to eliminate risk factors associated with training on live patients.
      Recently artificial intelligence has been integrated with tutoring systems like
      \u201cUnified Medical Language System\u201d (UMLS), which have resulted in a
      better quality of feedback, which the preclinical virtual patients provide to
      the students4,5. This interactive phase helps students to evaluate their clinical
      skills and compare their skills with the standard ones, thus creating an ideal
      and high-quality training environment. Studies have been carried out regarding
      the efficacy of AI systems, which have stipulated that preclinical students
      build higher competencies than with the use of traditional simulator units6-8.
      \nCurrently AI inbuilt virtual dental assistants are present in the market.
      They can execute various chair side tasks with greater accuracy and less manpower
      ensuring minimum error during the procedures. In the world of implantology and
      maxillofacial surgery AI helps plan and prepare surgeries with smallest details
      forgoing actual surgery. Some exceptional uses of AI include robotic surgeries
      in the field of maxillofacial surgery and bioprinting (where tissues and organs
      can be reconstructed in thin layers)9. The field of AI has flourished to great
      extent in the past decade; AI systems are an aid to the field of dentistry and
      dental education.\u00a0 \nThis narrative attempts to explain possible AI-based
      applications in the future, it can be used for dental diagnosis, planning out
      treatments, conducting image analysis, and record keeping. AI-based technologies
      streamline and reduce laborious workforce to routine tasks, it ensures dental
      procedures are possible at a lower cost and ultimately makes predictive, preventive,
      and participatory dentistry possible.\u00a0The use of AI in dental procedures
      needs to be guaranteed; its application with human oversight and evidence-based
      dentistry shall be expected. Dental education needs to be introduced to clinical
      AI solutions by promoting digital literacy in the future dental liveware.",

      Computation (EC) approaches are inspired by nature and solve optimization problems
      in a stochastic manner. They can offer a reliable and effective approach to
      address complex problems in real-world applications. EC algorithms have recently
      been used to improve the performance of Machine Learning (ML) models and the
      quality of their results. Evolutionary approaches can be used in all three parts
      of ML: preprocessing (e.g., feature selection and resampling), learning (e.g.,
      parameter setting, membership functions, and neural network topology), and postprocessing
      (e.g., rule optimization, decision tree/support vectors pruning, and ensemble
      learning). This article investigates the role of EC algorithms in solving different
      ML challenges. We do not provide a comprehensive review of evolutionary ML approaches
      here; instead, we discuss how EC algorithms can contribute to ML by addressing
      conventional challenges of the artificial intelligence and ML communities. We
      look at the contributions of EC to ML in nine sub-fields: feature selection,
      resampling, classifiers, neural networks, reinforcement learning, clustering,
      association rule mining, and ensemble methods. For each category, we discuss
      evolutionary machine learning in terms of three aspects: problem formulation,
      search mechanisms, and fitness value computation. We also consider open issues
      and challenges that should be addressed in future work.", "venue": "ACM Computing

      of Computing", "abstract": "Abstract:The term performance is used liberally
      in the computing and artificial intelligence (AI) literature, yet it is frequently
      deemed of a different order to the performances studied by theatre and performance
      studies and is therefore overlooked. This essay engages with these overlooked
      performances by considering three technological contexts that prompted creators
      and critics of computing to reach for the term: 1) Alan Turing''s invention
      of the universal computing machine, where \"machines perform computers\"; 2)
      Alan Kay''s invention of software as a meta-medium where \"software performs
      media\"; and 3) Brenda Laurel''s articulation of computers as theatre where
      \"machines, computers, software and humans collaborate to perform interfaces.\"
      These examples establish a milieu of performance within which AI is staged.
      Grounded within the author''s theatre practice employing mobile computing in
      site-responsive performance, the essay draws on observation of audiences'' capacity
      to overlook their own participation in algorithmic rituals that perpetuate both
      the event and its \"artificial,\" virtual characters. This prompts a dialogue
      with Lucy Suchman on the difference between plans and their execution as \"situated
      actions,\" and with Wendy Chun on the performance ontology of habit in new media,
      AI, machine learning, and \"big data.\" The essay provides entry points for
      discussing computing and AI in and as performance, and considers the differences
      that theatre and performance can make to understandings of computing and AI
      in practice and theory.", "venue": "Theatre Journal", "year": 2021, "referenceCount":

      is presented based on the data-driven approach for both linear and nonlinear
      elastic responses. Within the Double-Scale Finite Element Method (FE2) framework,
      a data-driven model is proposed to substitute the micro-level Finite Element
      (FE) simulations to reduce computational costs in multiscale simulations. The
      heterogeneity of porous solids at the micro-level is considered in various material
      properties and geometrical attributes. For material properties, elastic constants,
      which are Lame\u2019s coefficients, are subjected to be heterogeneous in the
      linear elastic responses. For geometrical features, different numbers, sizes,
      and locations of voids are considered to reflect the heterogeneity of porous
      solids. A database for homogenized microstructural responses is constructed
      from a series of micro-level FE simulations, and machine learning is used to
      train and test our proposed model. In particular, four geometrical descriptors
      are designed, based on N-probability and lineal-path functions, to clearly reflect
      the geometrical heterogeneity of various microstructures. This study indicates
      that a simple deep neural networks model can capture diverse microstructural

      "ABSTRACT Artificial agents are commonly described by using words that traditionally
      belong to the semantic field of life. I call this phenomenon the game of semantic
      extension. However, the semantic extension of words as crucial as \u2018autonomous\u2019,
      \u2018intelligent\u2019, \u2018creative\u2019, \u2018moral\u2019, and so on,
      is often perceived as unsatisfactory, which is signalled with the extensive
      use of inverted commas or other syntactical cues. Such practice, in turn, has
      provoked harsh criticism that usually refers back to the literal meaning of
      the words to show their inappropriateness in describing artificial agents. Hence
      the question: how can we choose our words appropriately and wisely while making
      sense of artificial agents? This paper tries to answer by sketching the main
      features of the game of semantic extension in relation to artificial agency,
      reviewing the related opportunities and risks, and advancing some practical
      suggestions on how to play the game well.", "venue": "Interdisciplinary Science

      "Smart home assistants, which enable users to control home appliances and can
      be used for holding entertaining conversations, have become an inseparable part
      of many people\u2019s homes. Recently, there have been many attempts to allow
      end-users to teach a home assistant new commands, responses, and rules, which
      can then be shared with a larger community. However, allowing end-users to teach
      an agent new responses, which are shared with a large community, opens the gate
      to malicious users, who can teach the agent inappropriate responses in order
      to promote their own business, products, or political views. In this paper,
      we present a platform that enables users to collaboratively teach a smart home
      assistant (or chatbot) responses using natural language. We present a method
      of collectively detecting malicious users and using the commands taught by the
      malicious users to further mitigate activity of future malicious users. We ran
      an experiment with 192 subjects and show the effectiveness of our platform.",

      haremos un breve repaso por la evoluci\u00f3n del procesamiento de lenguaje
      natural y la generaci\u00f3n de texto artificial. Desde la d\u00e9cada de 1990,
      vieron la luz las primeras ideas sobre generaci\u00f3n artificial de textos.
      En una primera instancia, las t\u00e9cnicas existentes resultaron insuficientes
      para resolver tareas, tales como la propia generaci\u00f3n de textos, la traducci\u00f3n
      autom\u00e1tica o la b\u00fasqueda de informaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, al pasar
      del tiempo se fueron generando nuevas ideas, con base en la comprensi\u00f3n
      propia de la generaci\u00f3n de textos desde la naturaleza humana, desde los
      primeros modelos de redes neuronales recurrentes hasta los modelos de lenguaje
      m\u00e1s actuales, desde la consecuci\u00f3n de palabras m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicas
      hasta lograr la generaci\u00f3n de obras literarias enteras de manera artificial.
      De esta forma visualizaremos en esencia c\u00f3mo es que se dio esta evoluci\u00f3n

      learning techniques have been able to perform tasks previously thought impossible
      or impractical such as image classification and natural language translation,
      as such this allows for the automation of tasks previously thought only possible
      by humans. This research work aims to test a na\u00efve post processing grammar
      correction method using a Long Short Term Memory neural network to rearrange
      translated sentences from Subject Object Verb to Subject Verb Object. Here machine
      learning based techniques are used to successfully translate works in an automated
      fashion rather than manually and post processing translations to increase sentiment
      and grammar accuracy. The implementation of the proposed methodology uses a
      bounding box object detection model, optical character recognition model and
      a natural language processing model to fully translate manga without human intervention.
      The grammar correction experimentation tries to fix a common problem when machines
      translate between two natural languages that use different ordering, in this
      case from Japanese Subject Object Verb to English Subject Verb Object. For this
      experimentation 2 sequence to sequence Long Short Term Memory neural networks
      were developed, a character level and a word level model using word embedding
      to reorder English sentences from Subject Object Verb to Subject Verb Object.
      The results showed that the methodology works in practice and can automate the

      the image of artificial intelligence in the media and its reflection in 2010s.
      Coverage of the fast development of technology in the mass media requires careful
      analysis and systematic monitoring due to not fully determined socio-ethical
      ideas about the place and role of artificial intelligence in human life. The
      paper attempts to study what media had about artificial intelligence in the
      second decade of the 21st century. Methodology and sources . Based on the results
      of quantitative and qualitative studies of the texts of Russian and foreign
      media, semantic changes in the representation of artificial intelligence are
      analyzed. To collect empirical informa tion, we used the analysis of documents
      (reports and preparatory notes of UNESCO for the development of an ethical code
      of artificial intelligence), public opinion polls, content analysis of Russian
      and foreign media. Results and discussion . According to the results of the
      study, correlation between intensity of references to artificial intelligence
      on political and economic phenomena was noted. In particular, there is a connection
      with the growth of economic activity of investors in advanced technologies,
      the launch of innovative technologies in the sphere of consumption by large
      companies and the strategic programs of states. Conclusion . At the moment,
      artificial intelligence is seen as positive technology. Implementation of AI
      into social and professional spheres is irreversible. The negative consequences
      of the development of AI are considering as an unobvious hypothetical future.
      By the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, the media discourse
      around AI expanded to such a state of uncertainty that it took action to establish
      an ethical framework for the development of technology.", "venue": "", "year":

      models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts. While
      there are many legitimate applications of such models, there is also a rising
      need to distinguish machine-generated texts from human-written ones (e.g., fake
      news detection). However, to our best knowledge, there is currently no benchmark
      environment with datasets and tasks to systematically study the so-called\"Turing
      Test\"problem for neural text generation methods. In this work, we present the
      TuringBench benchmark environment, which is comprised of (1) a dataset with
      200K human- or machine-generated samples across 20 labels {Human, GPT-1, GPT-2_small,
      GPT-2_medium, GPT-2_large, GPT-2_xl, GPT-2_PyTorch, GPT-3, GROVER_base, GROVER_large,
      GROVER_mega, CTRL, XLM, XLNET_base, XLNET_large, FAIR_wmt19, FAIR_wmt20, TRANSFORMER_XL,
      PPLM_distil, PPLM_gpt2}, (2) two benchmark tasks -- i.e., Turing Test (TT) and
      Authorship Attribution (AA), and (3) a website with leaderboards. Our preliminary
      experimental results using TuringBench show that FAIR_wmt20 and GPT-3 are the
      current winners, among all language models tested, in generating the most human-like
      indistinguishable texts with the lowest F1 score by five state-of-the-art TT
      detection models. The TuringBench is available at: https://turingbench.ist.psu.edu/",

      optimization using evolutionary algorithms is an interesting research topic.
      But right now, there are not much research in this topic that focused on Game,
      especially 2048. The 2048 game is one of the interesting games to study considering
      that the level of difficulty of this game will increase when the value of the
      resulting number increases. In addition, this game is also not limited by time
      but can be played continuously until the game ends. Neural network and tree
      are 2 architectures that can be used to play 2048 but require a long training
      time if you want to play well. In this study, this problem was optimized by
      an evolutionary algorithm (3 algorithms used in this study: Genetic Algorithm,
      WOA, and MFO). With this optimization, the best weight will be obtained in either
      the NN or Tree architecture to produce good intelligence in playing 2048. After
      going through various trials, it is concluded that the combination with the
      NN architecture is better than the Tree architecture and the WOA and MFO algorithms
      have succeeded in optimizing the architecture with better than the genetic algorithm.
      \nOptimasi neural network menggunakan algoritma evolutionary adalah topik penelitian
      yang menarik akan tetapi tidak banyak penelitian terkait hal ini yang berfokus
      pada game terutama game 2048. Game 2048 adalah salah satu game yang menarik
      untuk diteliti mengingat tingkat kesulitan permainan ini akan semakin meningkat
      disaat nilai angka yang dihasilkan semakin tinggi. Selain itu, permainan ini
      juga tidak dibatasi oleh waktu melainkan dapat dimainkan terus menerus hingga
      permainan berakhir. Neural network dan tree adalah 2 arsitektur yang dapat digunakan
      untuk memainkan 2048 akan tetapi membutuhkan waktu training yang lama jika ingin
      bermain dengan baik. Lama training tersebut yang pada penelitian ini dioptimasi
      oleh algoritma evolutionary (3 algoritma yang digunakan pada penelitian ini:
      Algoritma Genetic, WOA, dan MFO). Dengan adanya optimasi ini maka akan diperoleh
      bobot terbaik baik pada arsitektur NN ataupun Tree sehingga menghasilkan kecerdasan
      yang baik dalam memainkan 2048. Setelah melalui berbagai ujicoba maka disimpulkan
      bahwa kombinasi dengan arsitektur NN lebih baik dibandingkan dengan arsitektur
      Tree dan algoritma WOA dan MFO berhasil mengoptimasi arsitektur dengan lebih
      baik dibandingkan algoritma genetic.", "venue": "Jurnal Inovasi Teknologi dan

      build general-purpose arti\ufb01cial intelligence systems that can deal with
      unknown variables across unknown domains, we need benchmarks that measure how
      well these systems perform on tasks they have never seen before. A prerequisite
      for this is a measure of a task\u2019s generalization dif\ufb01culty, or how
      dissimilar it is from the system\u2019s prior knowledge and experience. If the
      skill of an intelligence system in a particular domain is de\ufb01ned as it\u2019s
      ability to consistently generate a set of instructions (or programs) to solve
      tasks in that domain, current benchmarks do not quantitatively measure the ef\ufb01ciency
      of acquiring new skills, making it possible to brute-force skill acquisition
      by training with unlimited amounts of data and compute power. With this in mind,
      we \ufb01rst propose a common language of instruction, a programming language
      that allows the expression of programs in the form of directed acyclic graphs
      across a wide variety of real-world domains and computing platforms. Using programs
      generated in this language, we demonstrate a match-based method to both score
      performance and calculate the generalization dif\ufb01culty of any given set
      of tasks. We use these to de\ufb01ne a numeric benchmark called the generalization
      index, or the g-index , to measure and compare the skill-acquisition ef\ufb01ciency
      of any intelligence system on a set of real-world tasks. Finally, we evaluate

      Review", "abstract": "Recently, advancements in computational machinery have
      facilitated the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to almost every
      field and industry. This fast-paced development in AI and sensing technologies
      have stirred an evolution in the realm of robotics. Concurrently, augmented
      reality (AR) applications are providing solutions to a myriad of robotics applications,
      such as demystifying robot motion intent and supporting intuitive control and
      feedback. In this paper, research papers combining the potentials of AI and
      AR in robotics over the last decade are presented and systematically reviewed.
      Four sources for data collection were utilized: Google Scholar, Scopus database,
      the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2020 proceedings, and
      the references and citations of all identified papers. A total of 29 papers
      were analyzed from two perspectives: a theme-based perspective showcasing the
      relation between AR and AI, and an application-based analysis highlighting how
      the robotics application was affected. These two sections are further categorized
      based on the type of robotics platform and the type of robotics application,
      respectively. We analyze the work done and highlight some of the prevailing
      limitations hindering the field. Results also explain how AR and AI can be combined
      to solve the model-mismatch paradigm by creating a closed feedback loop between
      the user and the robot. This forms a solid base for increasing the efficiency
      of the robotic application and enhancing the user\u2019s situational awareness,
      safety, and acceptance of AI robots. Our findings affirm the promising future
      for robust integration of AR and AI in numerous robotic applications.", "venue":

      with the future, our memories define our sense of identity. Because human memory
      engages the conscious realm, its examination has historically been approached
      from language and introspection and proceeded largely along separate parallel
      paths in humans and other animals. Here, we first highlight the achievements
      and limitations of this mind-based approach and make the case for a new brain-based
      understanding of declarative memory with a focus on hippocampal physiology.
      Next, we discuss the interleaved nature and common physiological mechanisms
      of navigation in real and mental spacetime. We suggest that a distinguishing
      feature of memory types is whether they subserve actions for single or multiple
      uses. Finally, in contrast to the persisting view of the mind as a highly plastic
      blank slate ready for the world to make its imprint, we hypothesize that neuronal
      networks are endowed with a reservoir of neural trajectories, and the challenge
      faced by the brain is how to select and match preexisting neuronal trajectories
      with events in the world. Expected final online publication date for the Annual

      study is to develop a synthesized conceptual framework for artificial intelligence
      (AI) adoption in the field of business-to-business (B2B) marketing.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA
      conceptual development approach has been adopted, based on a content analysis
      of 59 papers in peer-reviewed academic journals, to identify drivers, barriers,
      practices and consequences of AI adoption in B2B marketing. Based on these analyses
      and findings, a conceptual model is developed.\n\n\nFindings\nThis paper identifies
      the following two key drivers of AI adoption: the shortcomings of current marketing
      activities and the external pressure imposed by informatization. Seven outcomes
      are identified, namely, efficiency improvements, accuracy improvements, better
      decision-making, customer relationship improvements, sales increases, cost reductions
      and risk reductions. Based on information processing theory and organizational
      learning theory (OLT), an integrated conceptual framework is developed to explain
      the relationship between each construct of AI adoption in B2B marketing.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis
      study is the first conceptual paper that synthesizes drivers, barriers and outcomes
      of AI adoption in B2B marketing. The conceptual model derived from the combination
      of information processing theory and OLT provides a comprehensive framework
      for future work and opens avenues of research on this topic. This paper contributes
      to both AI literature and B2B literature.\n", "venue": "The journal of business

      "title": "How Biological Concepts and Evolutionary Theories Are Inspiring Advances
      in Machine Intelligence", "abstract": "Since its advent in the mid-twentieth
      century, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been heavily influenced
      by biology. From the structure of the brain to evolution by natural selection,
      core biological concepts underpin many of the fundamental breakthroughs in modern
      AI. Here, focusing specifically on artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have
      become commonplace in machine learning, we show the numerous connections between
      theories based on coevolution, multi-level selection, modularity and competition
      and related developments in ANNs. Our aim is to illuminate the valuable but
      often overlooked inspiration biologists have provided AI research and to spark
      future contributions at this intersection of biology and computer science. Although
      recent advances in AI have been swift, many significant challenges remain requiring
      innovative solutions. Thankfully, biology in all its forms still has a lot to
      teach us, especially when trying to create truly intelligent machines.", "venue":

      "title": "The mathematics of adversarial attacks in AI - Why deep learning is
      unstable despite the existence of stable neural networks", "abstract": "The
      unprecedented success of deep learning (DL) makes it unchallenged when it comes
      to classification problems. However, it is well established that the current
      DL methodology produces universally unstable neural networks (NNs). The instability
      problem has caused an enormous research effort -- with a vast literature on
      so-called adversarial attacks -- yet there has been no solution to the problem.
      Our paper addresses why there has been no solution to the problem, as we prove
      the following mathematical paradox: any training procedure based on training
      neural networks for classification problems with a fixed architecture will yield
      neural networks that are either inaccurate or unstable (if accurate) -- despite
      the provable existence of both accurate and stable neural networks for the same
      classification problems. The key is that the stable and accurate neural networks
      must have variable dimensions depending on the input, in particular, variable
      dimensions is a necessary condition for stability. Our result points towards
      the paradox that accurate and stable neural networks exist, however, modern
      algorithms do not compute them. This yields the question: if the existence of
      neural networks with desirable properties can be proven, can one also find algorithms
      that compute them? There are cases in mathematics where provable existence implies
      computability, but will this be the case for neural networks? The contrary is
      true, as we demonstrate how neural networks can provably exist as approximate
      minimisers to standard optimisation problems with standard cost functions, however,
      no randomised algorithm can compute them with probability better than 1/2.",

      be found of man''s characteristic desire for knowledge beyond, and far beyond,
      the limits of the authentic scientific discoveries of his own day than his wish
      to understand in complete detail the relationship between brain and mind-the
      one so finite, the other so amorphous and elusive. It is a subject which at
      present awakes a renewed interest, because we are invaded by the physicists
      and mathematicians-an invasion by no means unwelcome, bringing as it does new
      suggestions for analogy and comparison. We feel perhaps that we are being pushed,
      gently not roughly pushed, to accept the great likeness between the actions
      of electronic machines and those of the nervous system. At the same time we
      may misunderstand this invitation, and go beyond it to too ready an affirmation
      that there is identity. We should be wise to examine the nature of this concept
      and to see how far the electro-physicists share with us a common road. Medicine
      is placed by these suggestions in a familiar predicament. I refer to the dangers
      of our being unintentionally misled by pure science. Medical history furnishes
      many examples, such as the planetary and chemical theories of disease that were
      the outcome of the Scientific Renaissance. We are the same people as our ancestors
      and prone to their mistakes. We should reflect that if we go too far and too
      fast no one will deride us more unashamedly than the scientists who have tempted
      us. Discussion of mind-brain relations is, I know well, premature, but I suspect
      that it always will be premature, taking heart from a quotation that I shall
      make from Hughlings Jackson-not one of his best-known passages -because it may
      have been thought to be a sad lapse on his part. I believe it myself to be both
      true and useful, and so I repeat it.", "venue": "British medical journal", "year":
