      "Most Difference-in-Difference (DD) papers rely on many years of data and focus
      on serially correlated outcomes. Yet almost all these papers ignore the bias
      in the estimated standard errors that serial correlation introduce4s. This is
      especially troubling because the independent variable of interest in DD estimation
      (e.g., the passage of law) is itself very serially correlated, which will exacerbate
      the bias in standard errors. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly
      generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population
      Survey. For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its ''effect''
      as well as the standard error for this estimate. The standard errors are severely
      biased: with about 20 years of data, DD estimation finds an ''effect'' significant
      at the 5% level of up to 45% of the placebo laws. Two very simple techniques
      can solve this problem for large sample sizes. The first technique consists
      in collapsing the data and ignoring the time-series variation altogether; the
      second technique is to estimate standard errors while allowing for an arbitrary
      covariance structure between time periods. We also suggest a third technique,
      based on randomization inference testing methods, which works well irrespective
      of sample size. This technique uses the empirical distribution of estimated
      effects for placebo laws to form the test distribution.", "venue": "", "year":
