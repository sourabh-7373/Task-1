      to borrow, microcredit access led to a significant rise in investment in assets

      a reduction in income from casual labor. Overall there was no gain in income

      plan to what is called the \u201cEnsemble of Alternative Plans.\u201d This ensemble

      metrics. Second, the same outcome was found when the GMM system was examined.

      regarding the relationship between education and voter turnout. Moreover country-specific
      institutional and economic factors do not explain the heterogeneity in the relationship
      of interest. Alternatively, we show that disenfranchisement laws in the U.S.
      mediates the effect of education on voter turnout, such that the education gradient
      in voting is greater in U.S. States with the harshest disenfranchisement legislature.

      the causes and consequences of sudden policy U\u2010turns", "abstract": "Past
      research has long documented that voters dislike parties and leaders who reverse
      their policy positions. But would they tolerate (principled) policy U\u2010turns
      if they are motivated by external events, such as a large\u2010scale crisis
      or scientific evidence? In this study, we explore whether the motivation behind
      positional shifts affects voter evaluations of political parties. To do so,
      we seek to connect the causes and consequences of policy shifts, a synergy still
      unexplored in the literature. We suggest that, while U\u2010turns, in general,
      can be damaging to a party''s reputation, principled changes brought about by
      new scientific evidence or major crises should not necessarily have negative
      implications, because these changes can be necessary for the public good. We
      conducted a nationally representative survey experiment in Germany (n = 3127)
      featuring two classes of policy reversals: strategic and principled. Surprisingly,
      however, we find that voters by and large hold negative views of different types
      of policy U\u2010turns, thus including when external circumstances suggest change
      may be necessary. Interestingly, our empirical analysis reveals intriguing patterns.
      First, voters are willing to tolerate all sorts of policy reversals if the party
      ends up adopting their positions, suggesting that proximity matters even in
      the event of exogenous events. Second, voters with high levels of political
      trust tolerate different types of policy reversals, even when the party changes
      for mere strategic office\u2010seeking motivations. Coming from the premise
      that political and societal change is imperative, these findings have direct

      that economic decline makes individuals less tolerant of paying taxes, because
      tax increases would imply a reduction of their consumption level. We test this
      argument using longitudinal data from both repeated cross-sections and panel
      surveys in the United States, Canada and Japan. Our main finding is that tolerance
      of paying taxes is lower when individuals perceive that their economic situation

      "title": "CAN INCENTIVES INCREASE THE WRITING OF WILLS? AN EXPERIMENT", "abstract":
      "Writing a will can improve the transmission of wealth across generations, by
      preventing the dissipation of assets such as a family home when divided among
      multiple heirs, as well as, potentially, by focusing the mind of donors on their
      legacy and promoting savings. However, many individuals do not have a will,
      a particularly common situation among Black and lower socioeconomic status individuals.
      This paper reports on a randomized control trial testing whether the occasion
      of getting a mortgage might be an opportune time to encourage individuals to
      write a will. The findings are that the mortgage setting is already overwhelming
      for many individuals and is not a good time for additional bureaucratic burdens.
      This is particularly true for Black and less financially-sophisticated individuals.
      Furthermore, offering modest monetary incentives to write a will is suggestively
      effective, but mostly for those individuals who have little need of a will and
      are most sophisticated in their thinking about it. Thus, the findings suggest
      that the setting of when to approach individuals about writing a will is extremely
      important and that such overtures are most likely to succeed in contexts where
      individuals are not overly preoccupied with more immediate concerns.", "venue":

      Brazil is an emblematic financialization case in which a high Selic interest
      rate benefited financial institutions. However, the real Selic rate has historically
      declined, becoming negative in 2020. As a result, one should expect banks\u2019
      incomes to be negatively affected, yet this was not the case. Banks overcame
      this macroeconomic challenge by increasing credit operations. Within this context,
      our study confirms that the increasing credit spread income is inversely correlated
      to the declining Selic rate. Hence, we conclude that banks have maintained a
      rentier behavior: security gains derived from the past high Selic rate phase
      were replaced by a high spread charged to credit consumers.", "venue": "Brazilian

      Using a policy change in 2016 as a natural experiment, we employ a Difference-in-Difference
      (DID) model to analyse the effects of mobile payments development on crime rates
      in Chinese prefectures from 2015 to 2019. Our findings indicate that mobile
      payments expansion has a significant negative effect on theft, with the reduction
      of residents\u2019 cash holdings serving as a potential mechanism. However,
      we find no significant impact on non-economic crimes like sexual assault and
      murder. This study provides evidence supporting the role of policies and technologies
      enabling mobile payments development in deterring crime and enhancing social
      security.", "venue": "Applied Economics", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 18,

      "\n This article evaluates the implementation of the cartel leniency programme
      by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) using comprehensive data covering
      all related decisions of the CCI from 2009 to 2021. All other things remaining
      the same prima facie discoveries of cartels should have resulted in a \u2018shock\u2019
      to ex ante expected returns of cartels, thereby encouraging more leniency applications.
      But, we find no such results or rather no \u2018race\u2019 to the agency. A
      successful leniency programme requires a transparent and deterrent penalty,
      plus consistency in applying leniency provisions. However, inconsistencies in
      the choice of penalty base and uncertainties in determining final penalties
      while using mitigating and aggravating factors have led to a poor correlation
      of penalties with cartel gain or harm. Strategic or otherwise, this has encouraged
      appeals to the appellate authority, thereby reducing the effective penalty to
      levels below deterrence. Many acts of bid rigging have been penalized using
      less stringent criteria and, in a few circumstances, also provided the benefit
      of leniency. Further, while individuals concerned in leniency cases have always
      been penalized, the CCI has not been so consistent in non-leniency cartel cases.
      These asymmetries and \u2018other\u2019 costs create disincentives for exercising
      the leniency option. We offer suggestions for enhancing the possibility of a

      "\n We explore electoral explanations for U.S. governors\u2019 willingness to
      commute death sentences in their state. Across descriptive tests and pre-registered
      regression specifications, we find little evidence that election timing or term
      limits affect either the probability of commuting death sentences or the proportion
      of such sentences governors might commute. However, we do find evidence that
      governors are more likely to commute sentences \u2013 and commute sentences
      for a higher proportion of defendants \u2013 during the \u201clame duck\u201d
      period after their successor\u2019s election but before their inauguration.",

      the payment obligation) induces a 1.2 percentage point decline in timely payments.
      The implied revenue elasticity is about 0.9. Expressed in absolute terms, a
