      from the McKay''s catalog of non-isomorphic graphs and checks all these graphs

      from the list of all non-isomorphic trees and adding edges to them in all possible

      "The weighted ancestor problem on a rooted node-weighted tree $T$ is a generalization
      of the classic predecessor problem: construct a data structure for a set of
      integers that supports fast predecessor queries. Both problems are known to
      require $\\Omega(\\log\\log n)$ time for queries provided $\\mathcal{O}(n\\text{
      poly} \\log n)$ space is available, where $n$ is the input size. The weighted
      ancestor problem has attracted a lot of attention by the combinatorial pattern
      matching community due to its direct application to suffix trees. In this formulation
      of the problem, the nodes are weighted by string depth. This attention has culminated
      in a data structure for weighted ancestors in suffix trees with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      query time and an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time construction algorithm [Belazzougui
      et al., CPM 2021]. In this paper, we consider a different version of the weighted
      ancestor problem, where the nodes are weighted by any function $\\textsf{weight}$
      that maps the nodes of $T$ to positive integers, such that $\\textsf{weight}(u)\\le
      \\textsf{size}(u)$ for any node $u$ and $\\textsf{weight}(u_1)\\le \\textsf{weight}(u_2)$
      if node $u_1$ is a descendant of node $u_2$, where $\\textsf{size}(u)$ is the
      number of nodes in the subtree rooted at $u$. In the size-constrained weighted
      ancestor (SWAQ) problem, for any node $u$ of $T$ and any integer $k$, we are
      asked to return the lowest ancestor $w$ of $u$ with weight at least $k$. We
      show that for any rooted tree with $n$ nodes, we can locate node $w$ in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      time after $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time preprocessing. In particular, this implies
      a data structure for the SWAQ problem in suffix trees with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      query time and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time preprocessing, when the nodes are weighted
      by $\\textsf{weight}$. We also show several string-processing applications of

      set of G, denoted by \u0303\u03b3conh(G), is called the outer-convex hop domination

      "abstract": "We study search trees with 2-way comparisons (2WCST''s), which
      involve separate less-than and equal-to tests in their nodes, each test having
      two possible outcomes, yes and no. These trees have a much subtler structure
      than standard search trees with 3-way comparisons (3WCST''s) and are still not
      well understood, hampering progress towards designing an efficient algorithm
      for computing minimum-cost trees. One question that attracted attention in the
      past is whether there is an easy way to determine which type of comparison should
      be applied at any step of the search. Anderson, Kannan, Karloff and Ladner studied
      this in terms of the ratio between the maximum and total key weight, and defined
      two threshold values: $\\lambda^-$ is the largest ratio that forces the less-than
      test, and $\\lambda^+$ is the smallest ratio that forces the equal-to test.
      They determined that $\\lambda^- = 1/4$, but for the higher threshold they only
      showed that $\\lambda^+\\in [3/7,4/9]$. We give the tight bound for the higher
      threshold, by proving that in fact $\\lambda^+ = 3/7$.", "venue": "", "year":

      is the problem of finding a minimal set of edge modifications to transform a
      given graph into a cluster graph - a graph whose connected components are cliques.
      A set of induced, vertex pair disjoint paths of length two in the given graph
      is a lower bound for the number of required edge modifications. To find such
      sets, we define and examine a type of intersection graph, the P 3 - intersection
      graph , that models which induced paths of length two, called P 3 s, in a given
      graph share a vertex pair. Now, any independent set on the P 3 -intersection
      graph yields a lower bound for the Cluster Editing problem on the given graph.
      Unfortunately, Maximum Independent Set generally is NP-hard. However, the complexity
      on P 3 -intersection graphs is unknown. In this work, we show that the neighbourhood
      of every vertex in a P 3 -intersection graph can be partitioned into three cliques
      characterized by which vertex pair the contained vertices share with the respective
      vertex. We also prove that edges between these cliques strictly follow a specific
      structure. Additionally, we briefly discuss possible approaches to show the
      NP-hardness of Maximum Independent Set on P 3 -intersection graphs. Finally,

      t . Assume that a tree decomposition of treewidth t on a beer digraph with n
      vertices is given. We show that after O ( t 3 n ) time preprocessing on the
      beer digraph, ( i ) a beer distance query can be answered in O ( t 3 \u03b1
      ( n )) time, where \u03b1 ( n ) is the inverse Ackermann function, and (ii)
      a shortest beer path can be reported in O ( t 3 \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time, where
      L is the number of edges on the path. In the process we show an improved O (
      t 3 \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time shortest path query algorithm, compared with the currently
      best O ( t 4 \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time algorithm [Chaudhuri & Zaroliagis, 2000].
      We also consider queries in a dynamic setting where the weight of an edge in
      G can change over time. We show two data structures. Assume t is constant and
      let \u03b2 be any constant in (0 , 1). The first data structure uses O ( n )
      preprocessing time, answers a beer distance query in O ( \u03b1 ( n )) time
      and reports a shortest beer path in O ( \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time. It can be updated
      in O ( n \u03b2 ) time after an edge weight change. The second data structure
      has O ( n ) preprocessing time, answers a beer distance query in O (log n )
      time, reports a shortest beer path in O (log n + L ) time, and can be updated
      in O (log n ) time after an edge weight change.", "venue": "International Symposium

      "title": "On the Complexity of Simultaneous Geometric Embedding for Edge-Disjoint
      Graphs", "abstract": "Simultaneous Geometric Embedding (SGE) asks whether, for
      a given collection of graphs on the same vertex set V, there is an embedding
      of V in the plane that admits a crossing-free drawing with straightline edges
      for each of the given graphs. It is known that SGE is $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete,
      that is, the problem is polynomially equivalent to deciding whether a system
      of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer coefficients has a real
      solution. We prove that SGE remains $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete for edge-disjoint
      input graphs, that is, for collections of graphs without so-called public edges.
      As an intermediate result, we prove that it is $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete
      to decide whether a directional walk without repeating edges is realizable.
      Here, a directional walk consists of a sequence of not-necessarily distinct
      vertices (a walk) and a function prescribing for each inner position whether
      the walk shall turn left or shall turn right. A directional walk is realizable,
      if there is an embedding of its vertices in the plane such that the embedded
      walk turns according to the given directions. Previously it was known that realization
      is $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete to decide for directional walks repeating
      each edge at most 336 times. This answers two questions posed by Schaefer [\"On
      the Complexity of Some Geometric Problems With Fixed Parameters\", JGAA 2021].",

      these problems can be solved via inclusion-exclusion in O*(2^n) time [BjorklundHK09].
      Quantumly, there are faster algorithms for graph coloring with running time

      running time O(1.7274^n |F|^O(1)) [AmbainisBIKPV19]. In this paper, we give
      a quantum speedup for Set Partition, Set Cover, and Set Packing whenever there

      "title": "In search of the lost tree: Hardness and relaxation of spanning trees
      in temporal graphs", "abstract": "A graph whose edges only appear at certain
      points in time is called a temporal graph (among other names). These graphs
      are temporally connected if all ordered pairs of vertices are connected by a
      path that traverses edges in chronological order (a temporal path). Reachability
      in temporal graphs departs significantly from standard reachability; in particular,
      it is not transitive, with structural and algorithmic consequences. For instance,
      temporally connected graphs do not always admit spanning trees, i.e., subsets
      of edges that form a tree and preserve temporal connectivity among the nodes.
      In this paper, we revisit fundamental questions about the loss of universality
      of spanning trees. To start, we show that deciding if a spanning tree exists
      in a given temporal graph is NP-complete. What could be appropriate replacement
      for the concept? Beyond having minimum size, spanning trees enjoy the feature
      of enabling reachability along the same underlying paths in both directions,
      a pretty uncommon feature in temporal graphs. We explore relaxations in this
      direction and show that testing the existence of bidirectional spanning structures
      (bi-spanners) is tractable in general. On the down side, finding \\emph{minimum}
      such structures is NP-hard even in simple temporal graphs. Still, the fact that

      for short), we focus on efficiently finding non-colliding paths for a set of

      "abstract": "In graph theory we are often interested in a given property (such
      as being distance-regular or vertex-transitive) and we want to classify all
      members of a certain class of graphs that have this property. Usually, the class
      of graphs under consideration is infinite, and so one cannot simply use a computer
      to run through all the examples and test for the given property. Instead, one
      usually first studies \u201csmall\u201d examples in the class, makes conjectures
      and then tries to prove them. One of the first problems that can occur while
      trying to follow this strategy is that the number of \u201csmall\u201d members
      of the class that a computer can handle brute force is too small to allow for
      good conjectures. In such cases one tries to obtain theoretical results that
      either considerably reduce the search space within the class of studied graphs
      or makes the search over members of the class considerably faster. The next
      problem we often encounter is that one either finds no \u201csmall\u201d examples
      and then conjectures that there are no other examples in the studied class,
      or finds that (at least for small orders) all examples seem to be of a \u201ccertain
      kind\u201d. How do we then prove that this is indeed the case? In this talk
      we will consider at least two examples of such situations. In the first one
      we will see that brute force search is so hopeless that there is no way one
      can make any reasonable conjectures. We will then show a nice theoretical argument
      that drastically reduces the search space in a very efficient way. In the second
      example we will see that a brute force computer search seems to indicate that

      of a Mycielski graph when the diameter of the underlying graph is greater than
      4. To achieve this, the closeness of the Mycielski transformation of a path
      graph plays an important role. Additionally, leveraging the obtained results,

      finding a maximum size triangle-free $2$-matching in a graph $G$. A $2$-matching
      is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two
      edges from the subset. We present a fast combinatorial algorithm for the problem.
      Our algorithm and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the very complicated
      result by Hartvigsen from 1984. In the design of this algorithm we use several
      new concepts. It has been proven before that for any triangle-free $2$-matching
      $M$ which is not maximum the graph contains an $M$-augmenting path, whose application
      to $M$ results in a bigger triangle-free $2$-matching. It was not known how
      to efficiently find such a path. A new observation is that the search for an
      augmenting path $P$ can be restricted to so-called {\\em amenable} paths that
      go through any triangle $t$ contained in $P \\cup M$ a limited number of times.
      To find an augmenting path that is amenable and hence whose application does
      not create any triangle we forbid some edges to be followed by certain others.
      This operation can be thought of as using gadgets, in which some pairs of edges
      get disconnected. To be able to disconnect two edges we employ {\\em half-edges}.
      A {\\em half-edge} of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing
      exactly one of its endpoints. This is another novel application of half-edges
      that were already been used for TSP and other matching problems. Additionally,
      gadgets are not fixed during any augmentation phase, but are dynamically changing
      according to the currently discovered state of reachability by amenable paths.",

      Networks", "abstract": "Mesh, hypercube, HHN, bubbls-sort, star, transposition,
      and macro-star graphs have been proposed as interconnection networks used in
      high-performance parallel computer structures. A hypercube expresses a node
      with n binary numbers, and has an edge between 1-bit other nodes. A hypercube
      is an excellent network from a graph-theoretic point of view, such as node symmetry,
      fault tolerance, recursive scalability, and Hamiltonian cycles. However, compared
      to the increase in the number of nodes, the number of edges increases proportionally,
      so the network cost is not good. The HHN graph was proposed as a network that
      improved the network cost by improving the disadvantages of the hypercube. HHN
      graph uses hypercube as a basic module. The HHN graph is a network that has
      improved network cost by designing it to have a hierarchical structure based
      on a hypercube. HHN graphs have a simple routing algorithm with fewer branches
      and fewer links than hypercubes. Although HHN''s routing algorithm has a simple
      advantage, it has a disadvantage that the path length is long via unnecessary
      nodes. In this study, we propose a new routing algorithm that improves the path
      length of the HHN graph and analyze its efficiency. The improved routing algorithm
      proposed in this study has the result of improving the existing algorithm by
      30% on average. In addition, we analyze the embedding of one interconnection
      network into another is a very important issue in the design and analysis of
      parallel algorithms. Through such embeddings the algorithms originally developed
      for one architecture can be directly mapped to another architecture. This paper

      "title": "Vines and MAT-labeled graphs", "abstract": "The present paper explores
      a connection between two concepts arising from different fields of mathematics.
      The first concept, called vine, is a graphical model for dependent random variables.
      This concept first appeared in a work of Joe (1994), and the formal definition
      was given later by Cooke (1997). Vines have nowadays become an active research
      area whose applications can be found in probability theory and uncertainty analysis.
      The second concept, called MAT-freeness, is a combinatorial property in the
      theory of freeness of logarithmic derivation module of hyperplane arrangements.
      This concept was first studied by Abe-Barakat-Cuntz-Hoge-Terao (2016), and soon
      afterwards investigated further by Cuntz-M\\\"ucksch (2020). In the particular
      case of graphic arrangements, the last two authors (2023) recently proved that
      the MAT-freeness is completely characterized by the existence of certain edge-labeled
      graphs, called MAT-labeled graphs. In this paper, we first introduce a poset
      characterization of a vine, the so-called vineposet. Then we show that, interestingly,
      there exists an explicit equivalence between the categories of locally regular
      vineposets and MAT-labeled graphs. In particular, we obtain an equivalence between
      the categories of regular vineposets and MAT-labeled complete graphs. Several
      applications will be mentioned to illustrate the interaction between the two
      concepts. Notably, we give an affirmative answer to a question of Cuntz-M\\\"ucksch
      that MAT-freeness can be characterized by a generalization of the root poset
      in the case of graphic arrangements.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      Steiner Tree problem, we are given as input a set of points (called terminals)
      in the $\\ell_2$-metric space and the goal is to find the minimum-cost tree
      connecting them. Additional points (called Steiner points) from the space can
      be introduced as nodes in the solution. The seminal works of Arora [JACM''98]
      and Mitchell [SICOMP''99] provide a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS)
      for solving the Euclidean Steiner Tree problem in fixed dimensions. However,
      the problem remains poorly understood in higher dimensions (such as when the
      dimension is logarithmic in the number of terminals) and ruling out a PTAS for
      the problem in high dimensions is a notoriously long standing open problem (for
      example, see Trevisan [SICOMP''00]). Moreover, the explicit construction of
      optimal Steiner trees remains unknown for almost all well-studied high-dimensional
      point configurations. Furthermore, a vast majority the state-of-the-art structural
      results on (high-dimensional) Euclidean Steiner trees were established in the
      1960s, with no noteworthy update in over half a century. In this paper, we revisit
      high-dimensional Euclidean Steiner trees, proving new structural results. We
      also establish a link between the computational hardness of the Euclidean Steiner
      Tree problem and understanding the optimal Steiner trees of regular simplices
      (and simplicial complexes), proposing several conjectures and showing that some
      of them suffice to resolve the status of the inapproximability of the Euclidean
      Steiner Tree problem. Motivated by this connection, we investigate optimal Steiner
      trees of regular simplices, proving new structural properties of their optimal
      Steiner trees, revisiting an old conjecture of Smith [Algorithmica''92] about
      their optimal topology, and providing the first explicit, general construction

      that the pseudo\ufb02ow algorithm is very ef\ufb01cient in practice, and that
      the highest label version of the algorithm tends to perform best. Here, we improve
      the running time of the highest label pseudo\ufb02ow algorithm to O ( n 3 )
      using simple data structures and to O ( nm log ( n 2 / m )) using the dynamic
      trees data structure. Both these algorithms use a new form of Depth-First-Search
      implementation that is likely to be fast in practice as well. In addition, we
      give a new simpler description of the pseudo\ufb02ow algorithm by relating it
      to the simplex algorithm as applied to the maximum pre\ufb02ow problem de\ufb01ned

      is a string whose characters are common among all of them with two properties
      of being ordered but not consecutive. The general form of LCS problem belongs
      to the NP-hard problems, therefore, finding the exact LCS cannot be done in
      a reasonable time. Thus, heuristic methods have been proposed to find the best
      possible LCS. However, each heuristic is useful for a specific type of set.
      Some of them are useful for highly correlated strings and others are useful
      for less-correlated sets. Therefore, there is no single heuristic for any type
      of the set. This work introduces a hyper-heuristic that computes the correlation
      among a given set and accordingly assigns the given set to the proper heuristic.
      To compute a correlation measure, it uses the concepts of the Lempel-Ziv complexity
      and the longest common substring. The results show that the proposed hyper-heuristic

      A spanning tree with at most k leaves is referred to as a spanning k-ended tree.
      Spanning k-ended trees are important in various fields such as network design,
      graph theory, and communication networks. They provide a structured way to connect
      all the nodes in a network while ensuring efficient communication and minimizing
      unnecessary connections. In addition, they serve as fundamental components for
      algorithms in routing, broadcasting, and spanning tree protocols. However, determining
      whether a connected graph has a spanning k-ended tree or not is NP-complete.
      Therefore, it is important to identify sufficient conditions for the existence
      of such trees. The implicit-degree proposed by Zhu, Li, and Deng is an important
      indicator for the Hamiltonian problem and the spanning k-ended tree problem.
      In this article, we provide two sufficient conditions for K1,4-free connected
      graphs to have spanning k-ended trees for k = 2, 3. We prove the following:
      Let G be a K1,4-free connected n-graph. For k = 2, 3, if the implicit-degree
      sum of any k + 1 independent vertices of G is at least n \u2212 k + 2, then

      graph can be represented by a graph with an edge labelling, such that an edge
      is present in the network if and only if the edge is assigned the corresponding
      time label. A journey is a labelled path in a temporal graph such that labels
      on successive edges of the path are increasing, and if all vertices admit journeys
      to all other vertices, the temporal graph is temporally connected. A temporal
      spanner is a sublabelling of the temporal graph such that temporal connectivity
      is maintained. The study of temporal spanners has raised interest since the
      early 2000''s. Essentially two types of studies have been conducted: the positive
      side where families of temporal graphs are shown to (deterministically or stochastically)
      admit sparse temporal spanners, and the negative side where constructions of
      temporal graphs with no sparse spanners are of importance. Often such studies
      considered temporal graphs with happy or simple labellings, which associate
      exactly one label per edge. In this paper, we focus on the negative side and

      "title": "ANALYSIS OF THE DEFERRED SOLUTIONS METHOD FOR FINDING OF HAMILTONIAN
      CYCLE ON A GRAPH", "abstract": "The subject of research is the solving of the
      problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle on a graph, which belongs to the NP complexity
      class. The purpose of the work is to develop an effective polynomial algorithm
      for its optimal solving. This work is a continuation of the author''s previous
      work, where the method of deferred solutions is proposed, which uses a iterating
      over acceptable solutions scheme, which is explaining by the inability to formulate
      conditions for directly finding the optimal solution. For a graph of n \u00a0vertices,
      the size of the iteration space is (n-1)!. For large values n, the time costs
      are unacceptably large and their reduction is required. During the operation
      of the deferred solutions method, until the generated solution of the problem
      becomes a Hamiltonian cycle, it has name \u2013 a partial solution. The scheme
      underlying the deferred solutions method provides: the rejection of the complete
      construction of all solutions, the simultaneous formation of a set of partial
      solutions, the discarding of unpromising solutions, the possibility of returning
      to deferred partial solutions if necessary, the exclusion of the loss of the
      optimal solution when discarding partial solutions. However, as shown, only
      when choosing the correct estimate of partial solutions. At first, the real
      length of the partial solution path was using as an estimate. For an incomplete
      graph of 20 vertices, the optimal solution found in 0.005 minutes, but on a
      complete graph of 20 vertices, the search time was commensurate with the search
      of all possible solutions to the problem. The article analyzes and shows that
      the real length of the path as an estimate is logically justified and guarantees
      finding the optimal solution. However, does not always guarantee the minimum
      time spent searching for it, since when searching through the space of acceptable
      solutions, a search in width scheme worked out, which entails the construction
      of almost all acceptable solutions. This explains the different time spent on
      finding the optimal solution for tests incomplete and complete graphs \u2013
      the sets of acceptable solutions differ significantly. In this work, as an alternative,
      another estimate is proposing \u2013 the path length of the partial solution,
      measured in the arcs of the graph. As shown that the use of this estimate leads
      to a search of solutions in depth. This estimate reduces the time to find a
      solution, but does not guarantee an optimal result. For the successful application
      of the method, it is necessary to develop a new estimate of partial solutions
      that would combine the qualities of the estimates considered.", "venue": "Bulletin

      Set of Objects problem, we are given an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ and a family
      $\\mathcal{D}$ of $N$ objects, where each object is a connected subgraph of
      $G$. The task is to find a subfamily $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}$
      of maximum cardinality that consists of pairwise disjoint objects. This problem
      is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard and is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum
      number of pairwise disjoint polygons in a given family of polygons in the plane.
      As shown by Adamaszek et al. (J. ACM ''19), the problem admits a \\emph{quasi-polynomial
      time approximation scheme} (QPTAS): a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
      whose running time is bounded by $2^{\\mathrm{poly}(\\log(N),1/\\epsilon)} \\cdot

      regime only the trivial $\\mathcal{O}(N)$-approximation is known for the problem
      in full generality. In the restricted setting where the objects are pseudolines
      in the plane, Fox and Pach (SODA ''11) gave an $N^{\\varepsilon}$-approximation

      exist an orientation of the edges such that the resulting directed graph is
      strongly connected? Robbins\u2019 theorem [Robbins, Am. Math. Monthly, 1939]
      asserts that such an orientation exists if and only if the graph is 2-edge connected.
      A natural extension of this problem is the following: Suppose that the edges
      of the graph are partitioned into trails. Can the trails be oriented consistently
      such that the resulting directed graph is strongly connected? We show that 2-edge
      connectivity is again a su\ufb03cient condition and we provide a linear time
      algorithm for \ufb01nding such an orientation. The generalised Robbins\u2019
      theorem [Boesch, Am. Math. Monthly, 1980] for mixed multigraphs asserts that
      the undirected edges of a mixed multigraph can be oriented to make the resulting
      directed graph strongly connected exactly when the mixed graph is strongly connected
      and the underlying graph is bridgeless. We consider the natural extension where
      the undirected edges of a mixed multigraph are partitioned into trails. It turns
      out that in this case the condition of the generalised Robbin\u2019s Theorem
      is not su\ufb03cient. However, we show that as long as each cut either contains
      at least 2 undirected edges or directed edges in both directions, there exists
      an orientation of the trails such that the resulting directed graph is strongly

      set D in a graph G is a subset of its vertices such that every vertex of the
      graph which does not belong to set D is adjacent to at least one vertex from
      set D. A set of vertices of graph G is a global dominating set if it is a dominating
      set for both, graph G and its complement. The objective is to find a global
      dominating set with the minimum cardinality. The problem is known to be NP-hard.
      Neither exact nor approximation algorithm existed . We propose two exact solution
      methods, one of them being based on an integer linear program (ILP) formulation,
      three heuristic algorithms and a special purification procedure that further
      reduces the size of a global dominated set delivered by any of our heuristic
      algorithms. We show that the problem remains NP-hard for restricted types of
      graphs and specify some families of graphs for which the heuristics guarantee
      the optimality. The second exact algorithm turned out to be about twice faster
      than ILP for graphs with more than 230 vertices and up to 1080 vertices, which
      were the largest benchmark instances that were solved optimally. The heuristics
      were tested for the existing 2284 benchmark problem instances with up to 14000
      vertices and delivered solutions for the largest instances in less than one
      minute. Remarkably, for about 52% of the 1000 instances with the obtained optimal

      integers, such that the vertices at distance j should have at least p j as their
      label difference. If m\u00a0=\u00a03 and p 1\u00a0=\u00a03, \u2002p 2\u00a0=\u00a02,
      \u2002p 3\u00a0=\u00a01, it is called an L\u00a0(3, \u20022, \u20021)-labeling
      which is widely studied in the literature. In this paper, we define an L\u00a0(3,
      \u20022, \u20021)-path coloring of G as a labeling g\u00a0:\u00a0V\u00a0(G)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Z
      + such that between every pair of vertices there exists at least one path P
      where in the labeling restricted to this path is an L\u00a0(3, \u20022, \u20021)-labeling.
      Among the labels assigned to any vertex of G under g, the maximum label is called
      the span of g. The L\u00a0(3, \u20022, \u20021)-connection number of a graph
      G, denoted by k 3c \u00a0(G) is defined as the minimum value of span of g taken
      over all such labelings g. We call graphs with the special property that k 3c
      \u00a0(G)\u00a0=\u00a0|V\u00a0(G)\u00a0| as L\u00a0(3, \u20022, \u20021)-path
      graceful. In this paper, we obtain k 3c \u00a0(G) of graphs that possess a Hamiltonian
      path and carry forward the discussion to certain classes of graphs which do
      not possess a Hamiltonian path, which is novel to this paper. Although different
      kinds of labeling are studied in the literature with different mathematical
      constraints imposed, the idea of showing the existence of a graph with a given
      number as its minimum labeling number has rarely been addressed. We show that
      given any positive integer, there always exists an L\u00a0(3, \u20022, \u20021)-path
      graceful graph with the given integer as its k 3c \u00a0(G), thus addressing
      the inverse question. Finally exploiting the fact that there is no gap on the
      k 3c \u00a0(G) number line, we give an application of path colorings for secure
      communication on social networking sites. Efforts to deploy graph coloring in
      task scheduling, interference-free transmission, etc have been dealt by earlier
      researchers. In this paper, we deploy the L\u00a0(3, \u20022, \u20021)-path

      "title": "Asymptotic bounds for clustering problems in random graphs", "abstract":
      "Graph clustering is an important problem in network analysis. This problem
      can be approached by first finding a large cluster subgraph (i.e., a subgraph
      in which every connected component is a complete graph), perhaps in a relaxed
      form (connected components may have missing edges), and then assigning each
      of the remaining vertices to one of the connected components of the cluster
      subgraph according to some optimization criteria. The more vertices can be included
      in the initial cluster subgraph (also referred to as independent union of clusters),
      the more \u201cclusterable\u201d the graph is. This paper proposes a framework
      for establishing asymptotic bounds on the cardinality of independent unions
      of clusters in Erd\u0151s\u2010R\u00e9nyi random graphs with constant , referred
      to as uniform random graphs. In particular, sufficient conditions ensuring (where
      is the number of nodes) upper bounds with probability 1 are developed and shown
      to be applicable for the maximum independent union of cliques as well as some
      clique relaxations. In addition, it is shown that every graph must have an independent
      union of cliques of cardinality at least . Since this bound is asymptotically
      tight on uniform random graphs, this suggests that these graphs can be viewed
      as a \u201cleast clusterable\u201d class of graphs.", "venue": "Networks", "year":

      "title": "Cell-Probe Lower Bound for Accessible Interval Graphs", "abstract":
      "We spot a hole in the area of succinct data structures for graph classes from
      a universe of size at most $n^n$. Very often, the input graph is labeled by
      the user in an arbitrary and easy-to-use way, and the data structure for the
      graph relabels the input graph in some way. For any access, the user needs to
      store these labels or compute the new labels in an online manner. This might
      require more bits than the information-theoretic minimum of the original graph
      class, hence, defeating the purpose of succinctness. Given this, the data structure
      designer must allow the user to access the data structure with the original
      labels, i.e., relabeling is not allowed. We call such a graph data structure
      ``accessible''''. In this paper, we study the complexity of such accessible
      data structures for interval graphs, a graph class with information-theoretic
      minimum less than $n\\log n$ bits. - We formalize the concept of\"accessibility\"(which
      was implicitly assumed), and propose the\"universal interval representation\",
      for interval graphs. - Any data structure for interval graphs in universal interval
      representation, which supports both adjacency and degree query simultaneously
      with time cost $t_1$ and $t_2$ respectively, must consume at least $\\log_2(n!)+n/(\\log
      n)^{O(t_1+t_2)}$ bits of space. This is also the first lower bound for graph
      classes with information-theoretic minimum less than $n\\log_2n$ bits. - We
      provide efficient succinct data structures for interval graphs in universal
      interval representation supporting adjacency query and degree query individually
      in constant time and space costs. Therefore, two upper bounds together with
      the lower bound show that the two elementary queries for interval graphs are
      incompatible with each other in the context of succinct data structure. To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the first proof of such incompatibility phenomenon.",

      a vertex to divisors that are reduced with respect to a set of vertices. As
