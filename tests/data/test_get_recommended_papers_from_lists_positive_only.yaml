      simple, fast, dynamic", "abstract": "Dijkstra''s algorithm is the standard method
      for computing shortest paths on arbitrary graphs. However, it is slow for large
      graphs, taking at least linear time. It has been long known that for real world
      road networks, creating a hierarchy of well-chosen shortcuts allows fast distance
      and path computation, with exact distance queries seemingly being answered in
      logarithmic time. However, these methods were but heuristics until the work
      of Abraham et al.~[JACM 2016], where they defined a graph parameter called highway
      dimension which is constant for real-world road networks, and showed that in
      graphs of constant highway dimension, a shortcut hierarchy exists that guarantees
      shortest distance computation takes $O(\\log (U+V))$ time and $O(V \\log (U+V))$
      space, where $U$ is the ratio of the smallest to largest edge, and $V$ is the
      number of vertices. The problem is that they were unable to efficiently compute
      the hierarchy of shortcuts. Here we present a simple and efficient algorithm
      to compute the needed hierarchy of shortcuts in time and space $O(V \\log (U+V))$,
      as well as supporting updates in time $O( \\log (U+V))$.", "venue": "", "year":

      Longest Path Problem is a question of finding the maximum length between pairs
      of vertices of a graph. In the general case, the problem is NP-hard. However,
      there is a small collection of graph classes for which there exists an efficient
      solution. Current approaches involve either approximation or computational enumeration.
      For Tree-like classes of graphs, there are approximation and enumeration algorithms

      the longest path problem with algebraic operations and conditions that exactly
      identify and or approximate the solution in polynomial time. We next introduce
      a ''booleanize'' mapping on the adjacency matrix of a graph which we prove identifies
      the solution for trees, uniform block graphs, block graphs, and directed acyclic
      graphs, with approached conditions. Finally, we display the algorithms to find
      the solution, in addition to algorithms that generate all the longest paths.",

      "title": "Shortest Beer Path Queries in Digraphs with Bounded Treewidth", "abstract":
      "A beer digraph G is a real-valued weighted directed graph where some of the
      vertices have beer stores. A beer path from a vertex u to a vertex v in G is
      a path in G from u to v that visits at least one beer store. In this paper we
      consider the online shortest beer path query in beer digraphs with bounded treewidth
      t . Assume that a tree decomposition of treewidth t on a beer digraph with n
      vertices is given. We show that after O ( t 3 n ) time preprocessing on the
      beer digraph, ( i ) a beer distance query can be answered in O ( t 3 \u03b1
      ( n )) time, where \u03b1 ( n ) is the inverse Ackermann function, and (ii)
      a shortest beer path can be reported in O ( t 3 \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time, where
      L is the number of edges on the path. In the process we show an improved O (
      t 3 \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time shortest path query algorithm, compared with the currently
      best O ( t 4 \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time algorithm [Chaudhuri & Zaroliagis, 2000].
      We also consider queries in a dynamic setting where the weight of an edge in
      G can change over time. We show two data structures. Assume t is constant and
      let \u03b2 be any constant in (0 , 1). The first data structure uses O ( n )
      preprocessing time, answers a beer distance query in O ( \u03b1 ( n )) time
      and reports a shortest beer path in O ( \u03b1 ( n ) L ) time. It can be updated
      in O ( n \u03b2 ) time after an edge weight change. The second data structure
      has O ( n ) preprocessing time, answers a beer distance query in O (log n )
      time, reports a shortest beer path in O (log n + L ) time, and can be updated
      in O (log n ) time after an edge weight change.", "venue": "International Symposium

      tree) succinctly represents $(s, t)$ min-cuts (and therefore, $(s, t)$ max-flow

      we give an $m^{1+o(1)}$-time algorithm for constructing a Gomory-Hu tree for

      same running time as the single-pair max-flow problem, up to a subpolynomial
      factor. Prior to our work, the best known Gomory-Hu tree algorithm was obtained

      A natural extension of this problem is the following: Suppose that the edges
      of the graph are partitioned into trails. Can the trails be oriented consistently
      such that the resulting directed graph is strongly connected? We show that 2-edge
      connectivity is again a su\ufb03cient condition and we provide a linear time

      the undirected edges of a mixed multigraph can be oriented to make the resulting

      for short), we focus on efficiently finding non-colliding paths for a set of

      finding a maximum size triangle-free $2$-matching in a graph $G$. A $2$-matching
      is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two
      edges from the subset. We present a fast combinatorial algorithm for the problem.
      Our algorithm and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the very complicated
      result by Hartvigsen from 1984. In the design of this algorithm we use several
      new concepts. It has been proven before that for any triangle-free $2$-matching
      $M$ which is not maximum the graph contains an $M$-augmenting path, whose application
      to $M$ results in a bigger triangle-free $2$-matching. It was not known how
      to efficiently find such a path. A new observation is that the search for an
      augmenting path $P$ can be restricted to so-called {\\em amenable} paths that
      go through any triangle $t$ contained in $P \\cup M$ a limited number of times.
      To find an augmenting path that is amenable and hence whose application does
      not create any triangle we forbid some edges to be followed by certain others.
      This operation can be thought of as using gadgets, in which some pairs of edges
      get disconnected. To be able to disconnect two edges we employ {\\em half-edges}.
      A {\\em half-edge} of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing
      exactly one of its endpoints. This is another novel application of half-edges
      that were already been used for TSP and other matching problems. Additionally,
      gadgets are not fixed during any augmentation phase, but are dynamically changing
      according to the currently discovered state of reachability by amenable paths.",

      time, where n is the number of vertices currently in G . Under incremental (insertion

      that support distance queries in O (lg n ) worst-case time and vertex insertion
      or deletion in O (lg n ) amortized time, where n is the maximum number of vertices

      Given a Hamiltonian graph G , and a Hamiltonian cycle C of G , can we compute
      a second Hamiltonian cycle C \u2032 \u0338 = C of G , and if yes, how quickly?
      If the input graph G satisfies certain conditions (e.g. if every vertex of G
      is odd, or if the minimum degree is large enough), it is known that such a second
      Hamiltonian cycle always exists. Despite substantial efforts, no subexponential-time
      algorithm is known for this problem. In this paper we relax the problem of computing
      a second Hamiltonian cycle in two ways. First, we consider approximating the
      length of a second cycle on n -vertex graphs with minimum degree \u03b4 and
      maximum degree \u2206. We provide a linear-time algorithm for computing a cycle

      of the problem is probabilistic. We propose a randomized algorithm which computes

      algorithm for the maximum cardinality matching problem in the CONGEST model,
      where $\\mu(G)$ means the maximum size of a matching of the input graph $G$.
      The proposed algorithm substantially improves the current best worst-case running

      an augmenting path of length $\\ell$ with high probability within $\\tilde{O}(\\ell)$
      rounds, which positively settles an open problem left in the prior work by Ahmadi
      and Kuhn [DISC''20]. The idea of our augmenting path algorithm is based on a
      recent result by Kitamura and Izumi [IEICE Trans.''22], which efficiently identifies
      a sparse substructure of the input graph containing an augmenting path, following
      a new concept called \\emph{alternating base trees}. Their algorithm, however,
      resorts to a centralized approach of collecting the entire information of the
      substructure into a single vertex for constructing an augmenting path. The technical
      highlight of this paper is to provide a fully-decentralized counterpart of such
      a centralized method. To develop the algorithm, we prove several new structural

      is the problem of finding a minimal set of edge modifications to transform a
      given graph into a cluster graph - a graph whose connected components are cliques.
      A set of induced, vertex pair disjoint paths of length two in the given graph
      is a lower bound for the number of required edge modifications. To find such
      sets, we define and examine a type of intersection graph, the P 3 - intersection
      graph , that models which induced paths of length two, called P 3 s, in a given
      graph share a vertex pair. Now, any independent set on the P 3 -intersection
      graph yields a lower bound for the Cluster Editing problem on the given graph.
      Unfortunately, Maximum Independent Set generally is NP-hard. However, the complexity
      on P 3 -intersection graphs is unknown. In this work, we show that the neighbourhood
      of every vertex in a P 3 -intersection graph can be partitioned into three cliques
      characterized by which vertex pair the contained vertices share with the respective
      vertex. We also prove that edges between these cliques strictly follow a specific
      structure. Additionally, we briefly discuss possible approaches to show the
      NP-hardness of Maximum Independent Set on P 3 -intersection graphs. Finally,
      we transfer the concept of P 3 -intersection graphs to stars and paths of arbitrary

      of U. We consider the problems of partitioning U into k sets from F, covering
      U with k sets from F, and packing k non-intersecting sets from F into U. Classically,
      these problems can be solved via inclusion-exclusion in O*(2^n) time [BjorklundHK09].
      Quantumly, there are faster algorithms for graph coloring with running time
      O(1.9140^n) [ShimizuM22] and for Set Cover with a small number of sets with
      running time O(1.7274^n |F|^O(1)) [AmbainisBIKPV19]. In this paper, we give
      a quantum speedup for Set Partition, Set Cover, and Set Packing whenever there
      is a classical enumeration algorithm that lends itself to a quadratic quantum
      speedup, which, for any subinstance on a subset X of U, enumerates at least

      Coloring, we further improve the running time to O(1.7956^n) by leveraging faster

      set of connected subgraphs in a planar graph", "abstract": "In the Maximum Independent
      Set of Objects problem, we are given an $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ and a family
      $\\mathcal{D}$ of $N$ objects, where each object is a connected subgraph of
      $G$. The task is to find a subfamily $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}$
      of maximum cardinality that consists of pairwise disjoint objects. This problem
      is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard and is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum
      number of pairwise disjoint polygons in a given family of polygons in the plane.
      As shown by Adamaszek et al. (J. ACM ''19), the problem admits a \\emph{quasi-polynomial
      time approximation scheme} (QPTAS): a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
      whose running time is bounded by $2^{\\mathrm{poly}(\\log(N),1/\\epsilon)} \\cdot
      n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, in the polynomial-time
      regime only the trivial $\\mathcal{O}(N)$-approximation is known for the problem
      in full generality. In the restricted setting where the objects are pseudolines
      in the plane, Fox and Pach (SODA ''11) gave an $N^{\\varepsilon}$-approximation
      algorithm with running time $N^{2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\varepsilon)}}$,
      for any $\\varepsilon>0$. In this work, we present an $\\text{OPT}^{\\varepsilon}$-approximation
      algorithm for the problem that runs in time $N^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\varepsilon^2)}
      n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, thus improving upon the result
      of Fox and Pach both in terms of generality and in terms of the running time.
      Our approach combines the methodology of Voronoi separators, introduced by Marx
      and Pilipczuk (TALG ''22), with a new analysis of the approximation factor.",

      in temporal graphs", "abstract": "A graph whose edges only appear at certain
      points in time is called a temporal graph (among other names). These graphs
      are temporally connected if all ordered pairs of vertices are connected by a
      path that traverses edges in chronological order (a temporal path). Reachability
      in temporal graphs departs significantly from standard reachability; in particular,
      it is not transitive, with structural and algorithmic consequences. For instance,
      temporally connected graphs do not always admit spanning trees, i.e., subsets
      of edges that form a tree and preserve temporal connectivity among the nodes.
      In this paper, we revisit fundamental questions about the loss of universality
      of spanning trees. To start, we show that deciding if a spanning tree exists
      in a given temporal graph is NP-complete. What could be appropriate replacement
      for the concept? Beyond having minimum size, spanning trees enjoy the feature
      of enabling reachability along the same underlying paths in both directions,
      a pretty uncommon feature in temporal graphs. We explore relaxations in this
      direction and show that testing the existence of bidirectional spanning structures
      (bi-spanners) is tractable in general. On the down side, finding \\emph{minimum}
      such structures is NP-hard even in simple temporal graphs. Still, the fact that
      bidirectionality can be tested efficiently may find applications, e.g. for routing
      and security, and the corresponding primitive that we introduce in the algorithm
      may be of independent interest.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

      beauty and unique cultural richness. There are 19 interesting tourist attractions
      spread throughout the area, but tourists often face difficulties in planning
      efficient visiting routes. From this case, it can be solved by applying graph
      theory in terms of searching for the shortest distance which is completed using
      the shortest path search algorithm. Then these 19 tourist objects are used to
      build a weighted graph, where the nodes represent the tourist objects and the
      edges of the graph describe the distance or travel time between these objects.
      Therefore, this research aims to compare the shortest path search algorithm
      with parameters to compare the shortest distance results, algorithm complexity
      and execution time for tourism in the Sumba area. The results of this research
      involve a comparison of several shortest path search algorithms, with the aim
      of finding the shortest distance results, algorithm complexity, and execution
      time for tourism in the Sumba area. Based on the test results of the five algorithms
      with the parameters that have been prepared, and the findings show that each
      algorithm has its own characteristics, the results are as follows: Dijkstra''s
      algorithm can be used to calculate the shortest route for single-source and
      single-destination types. This resembles the Bellman-Ford algorithm, only the
      Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used simultaneously on graphs that have negative
      weight values. Meanwhile, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is suitable for use on
      the all-pairs type. Then, the Johnson Algorithm can be used to determine the
      shortest path from all pairs of paths where the destination node is located

      smaller. There is not much known about these graphs. We obtained a list of diameter-2-critical
      graphs with at most 10 nodes using two different methods. The first method starts
      from the McKay''s catalog of non-isomorphic graphs and checks all these graphs

      from the list of all non-isomorphic trees and adding edges to them in all possible

      In recent years, several algorithms with different time complexities have been
      proposed for the construction of greedy spanners. However, a not so apparently
      suitable algorithm with running time complexity \ud835\udc42(\ud835\udc5b 3
      log \ud835\udc5b) , namely the FG algorithm, is proved to be practically the
      fastest algorithm known for this task. One of the common bottlenecks in the
      greedy spanner construction algorithms is their use of the shortest path search
      operation (usually using Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm). In this paper, we propose
      some improvements to the FG algorithm in order to reduce the imposed costs of
      the shortest path search operation, and therefore to reduce the time required
      for the construction of greedy spanners. In the first improvement, we reduce
      the number of this operation calls and in the second one, we reduce the cost
      of each run of the operation. Experimental results show these improvements are
      able to significantly accelerate the construction of greedy spanners, compared

      "We study several graph layout problems with a min max objective. Here, given
      a graph we wish to find a linear ordering of the vertices that minimizes some
      worst case objective over the natural cuts in the ordering; which separate an
      initial segment of the vertices from the rest. A prototypical problem here is
      cutwidth, where we want to minimize the maximum number of edges crossing a cut.
      The only known algorithm here is by [Leighton-Rao J.ACM 99] based on recursively
      partitioning the graph using balanced cuts. This achieves an $O(\\log^{3/2}{n})$
      approximation using the $ O(\\log^{1/2}{n})$ approximation of [Arora-Rao-Vazirani
      J.ACM 09] for balanced cuts. We depart from the above approach and give an improved
      $ O(\\log^{1+o(1)}{n})$ approximation for cutwidth. Our approach also gives
      a similarly improved $ O(\\log^{1+o(1)}{n})$ approximation for finding the pathwidth
      of a graph. Previously, the best known approximation for pathwidth was $O(\\log^{3/2}{n})$.",

      "The weighted ancestor problem on a rooted node-weighted tree $T$ is a generalization
      of the classic predecessor problem: construct a data structure for a set of
      integers that supports fast predecessor queries. Both problems are known to
      require $\\Omega(\\log\\log n)$ time for queries provided $\\mathcal{O}(n\\text{
      poly} \\log n)$ space is available, where $n$ is the input size. The weighted
      ancestor problem has attracted a lot of attention by the combinatorial pattern
      matching community due to its direct application to suffix trees. In this formulation
      of the problem, the nodes are weighted by string depth. This attention has culminated
      in a data structure for weighted ancestors in suffix trees with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      query time and an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time construction algorithm [Belazzougui
      et al., CPM 2021]. In this paper, we consider a different version of the weighted
      ancestor problem, where the nodes are weighted by any function $\\textsf{weight}$
      that maps the nodes of $T$ to positive integers, such that $\\textsf{weight}(u)\\le
      \\textsf{size}(u)$ for any node $u$ and $\\textsf{weight}(u_1)\\le \\textsf{weight}(u_2)$
      if node $u_1$ is a descendant of node $u_2$, where $\\textsf{size}(u)$ is the
      number of nodes in the subtree rooted at $u$. In the size-constrained weighted
      ancestor (SWAQ) problem, for any node $u$ of $T$ and any integer $k$, we are
      asked to return the lowest ancestor $w$ of $u$ with weight at least $k$. We
      show that for any rooted tree with $n$ nodes, we can locate node $w$ in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      time after $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time preprocessing. In particular, this implies
      a data structure for the SWAQ problem in suffix trees with $\\mathcal{O}(1)$
      query time and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time preprocessing, when the nodes are weighted
      by $\\textsf{weight}$. We also show several string-processing applications of

      sparsification for directed Eulerian graphs is a key component in the design
      of fast algorithms for solving directed Laplacian linear systems. Directed Laplacian
      linear system solvers are crucial algorithmic primitives to fast computation
      of fundamental problems on random walks, such as computing stationary distribution,
      hitting and commute time, and personalized PageRank vectors. While spectral
      sparsification is well understood for undirected graphs and it is known that
      for every graph $G,$ $(1+\\varepsilon)$-sparsifiers with $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$
      edges exist [Batson-Spielman-Srivastava, STOC ''09] (which is optimal), the
      best known constructions of Eulerian sparsifiers require $\\Omega(n\\varepsilon^{-2}\\log^4
      n)$ edges and are based on short-cycle decompositions [Chu et al., FOCS ''18].
      In this paper, we give improved constructions of Eulerian sparsifiers, specifically:
      1. We show that for every directed Eulerian graph $\\vec{G},$ there exist an
      Eulerian sparsifier with $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2} \\log^2 n \\log^2\\log n + n\\varepsilon^{-4/3}\\log^{8/3}
      n)$ edges. This result is based on combining short-cycle decompositions [Chu-Gao-Peng-Sachdeva-Sawlani-Wang,
      FOCS ''18, SICOMP] and [Parter-Yogev, ICALP ''19], with recent progress on the
      matrix Spencer conjecture [Bansal-Meka-Jiang, STOC ''23]. 2. We give an improved
      analysis of the constructions based on short-cycle decompositions, giving an
      $m^{1+\\delta}$-time algorithm for any constant $\\delta>0$ for constructing

      Mincuts", "abstract": "A cactus representation of a graph, introduced by Dinitz
      et al. in 1976, is an edge sparsifier of $O(n)$ size that exactly captures all
      global minimum cuts of the graph. It is a central combinatorial object that
      has been a key ingredient in almost all algorithms for the connectivity augmentation
      problems and for maintaining minimum cuts under edge insertions (e.g. [NGM97],
      [CKL+22], [Hen97]). This sparsifier was generalized to Steiner cactus for a
      vertex set $T$, which can be seen as a vertex sparsifier of $O(|T|)$ size that
      captures all partitions of $T$ corresponding to a $T$-Steiner minimum cut, and
      also hypercactus, an analogous concept in hypergraphs. These generalizations
      further extend the applications of cactus to the Steiner and hypergraph settings.
      In a long line of work on fast constructions of cactus and its generalizations,
      a near-linear time construction of cactus was shown by [Karger and Panigrahi
      2009]. Unfortunately, their technique based on tree packing inherently does
      not generalize. The state-of-the-art algorithms for Steiner cactus and hypercactus
      are still slower than linear time by a factor of $\\Omega(|T|)$ [DV94] and $\\Omega(n)$
      [CX17], respectively. We show how to construct both Steiner cactus and hypercactus
      using polylogarithmic calls to max flow, which gives the first almost-linear
      time algorithms of both problems. The constructions immediately imply almost-linear-time
      connectivity augmentation algorithms in the Steiner and hypergraph settings,
      as well as speed up the incremental algorithm for maintaining minimum cuts in
      hypergraphs by a factor of $n$. The key technique behind our result is a novel
      variant of the influential isolating mincut technique [LP20, AKL+21] which we
      called maximal isolating mincuts. This technique makes the isolating mincuts
      to be\"more balanced\"which, we believe, will likely be useful in future applications.",

      a new heuristic algorithm for computing a minimum FAS in directed graphs. The

      the FAS size by more than 50%. The heuristic is based on computing the PageRank
      score of the nodes of the directed line graph of the input directed graph. Although
      the time required by our heuristic is heavily influenced by the size of the
      produced line graph, our experimental results show that it runs very fast even
      for very large graphs used in graph drawing. We compare results produced by
      our heuristic to known exact results for specific graphs used in a previous
      study and discuss the interesting trade-off. Finally, our experimental results

      "abstract": ". The problem of finding the shortest path between a source and
      a destination node, commonly represented by graphs, has several computational
      algorithms as an attempt to find what is called the minimum path. Depending
      on the number of nodes in-between the source and destination, the process of
      finding the shortest path can demand a high computational cost (with polynomial
      complexity). A solution to reduce the computational cost is the use of the concept
      of parallelism, which divides the algorithm tasks between the processing cores.
      This article presents a comparative analysis of the main algorithms of the shortest
      path class: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall and Johnson. The performance
      of each algorithm was evaluated considering different parallelization approaches
      and they were applied on general and open-pit mining databases present in the
      literature. The experimental results showed an improvement in performance of
      about 55% on the execution time depending on the chosen parallelization point",

      "title": "Multicut Problems in Embedded Graphs: The Dependency of Complexity
      on the Demand Pattern", "abstract": "The Multicut problem asks for a minimum
      cut separating certain pairs of vertices: formally, given a graph $G$ and demand
      graph $H$ on a set $T\\subseteq V(G)$ of terminals, the task is to find a minimum-weight
      set $C$ of edges of $G$ such that whenever two vertices of $T$ are adjacent
      in $H$, they are in different components of $G\\setminus C$. Colin de Verdi\\`{e}re
      [Algorithmica, 2017] showed that Multicut with $t$ terminals on a graph $G$
      of genus $g$ can be solved in time $f(t,g)n^{O(\\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$. Cohen-Addad
      et al. [JACM, 2021] proved a matching lower bound showing that the exponent
      of $n$ is essentially best possible (for fixed values of $t$ and $g$), even
      in the special case of Multiway Cut, where the demand graph $H$ is a complete
      graph. However, this lower bound tells us nothing about other special cases
      of Multicut such as Group 3-Terminal Cut. We show that if the demand pattern
      is, in some sense, close to being a complete bipartite graph, then Multicut
      can be solved faster than $f(t,g)n^{O(\\sqrt{g^2+gt+t})}$, and furthermore this
      is the only property that allows such an improvement. Formally, for a class
      $\\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, Multicut$(\\mathcal{H})$ is the special case where
      the demand graph $H$ is in $\\mathcal{H}$. For every fixed class $\\mathcal{H}$
      (satisfying some mild closure property), fixed $g$, and fixed $t$, our main
      result gives tight upper and lower bounds on the exponent of $n$ in algorithms
      solving Multicut$(\\mathcal{H})$. In addition, we investigate a similar setting
      where, instead of parameterizing by the genus $g$ of $G$, we parameterize by
      the minimum number $k$ of edges of $G$ that need to be deleted to obtain a planar
      graph. Interestingly, in this setting it makes a significant difference whether
      the graph $G$ is weighted or unweighted: further nontrivial algorithmic techniques
      give substantial improvements in the unweighted case.", "venue": "", "year":

      prove that isomorphism of tournaments of twin width at most $k$ can be decided
      in time $k^{O(\\log k)}n^{O(1)}$. This implies that the isomorphism problem
      for classes of tournaments of bounded or moderately growing twin width is in
      polynomial time. By comparison, there are classes of undirected graphs of bounded
      twin width that are isomorphism complete, that is, the isomorphism problem for
      the classes is as hard as the general graph isomorphism problem. Twin width
      is a graph parameter that has been introduced only recently (Bonnet et al.,
      FOCS 2020), but has received a lot of attention in structural graph theory since
      then. On directed graphs, it is functionally smaller than clique width. We prove
      that on tournaments (but not on general directed graphs) it is also functionally
      smaller than directed tree width (and thus, the same also holds for cut width
      and directed path width). Hence, our result implies that tournament isomorphism
      testing is also fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by any of these
      parameters. Our isomorphism algorithm heavily employs group-theoretic techniques.
      This seems to be necessary: as a second main result, we show that the combinatorial
      Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm does not decide isomorphism of tournaments of twin
      width at most 35 if its dimension is $o(\\sqrt n)$. (Throughout this abstract,
      $n$ is the order of the input graphs.)", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023,

      "Popularity is an approach in mechanism design to find fair structures in a
      graph, based on the votes of the nodes. Popular matchings are the relaxation
      of stable matchings: given a graph G=(V,E) with strict preferences on the neighbors
      of the nodes, a matching M is popular if there is no other matching M'' such
      that the number of nodes preferring M'' is more than those preferring M. This
      paper considers the popularity testing problem, when the task is to decide whether
      a given matching is popular or not. Previous algorithms applied reductions to
      maximum weight matchings. We give a new algorithm for testing popularity by
      reducing the problem to maximum matching testing, thus attaining a linear running
      time O(|E|). Linear programming-based characterization of popularity is often
      applied for proving the popularity of a certain matching. As a consequence of
      our algorithm we derive a more structured dual witness than previous ones. Based
      on this result we give a combinatorial characterization of fractional popular
      matchings, which are a special class of popular matchings.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "We provide a deterministic algorithm for computing the $5$-edge-connected components
      of an undirected multigraph in linear time. There were probably good indications
      that this computation can be performed in linear time, but no such algorithm
      was actually known prior to this work. Thus, our paper answers a theoretical
      question, and sheds light on the possibility that a solution may exist for general
      $k$. A key component in our algorithm is an oracle for answering connectivity
      queries for pairs of vertices in the presence of at most four edge-failures.
      Specifically, the oracle has size $O(n)$, it can be constructed in linear time,
      and it answers connectivity queries in the presence of at most four edge-failures
      in worst-case constant time, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the
      graph. We note that this is a result of independent interest. Our paper can
      be considered as a follow-up of recent work on computing the $4$-edge-connected
      components in linear time. However, in dealing with the computation of the $5$-edge-connected
      components, we are faced with unique challenges that do not appear when dealing
      with lower connectivity. The problem is that the $4$-edge cuts in $3$-edge-connected
      graphs are entangled in various complicated ways, that make it difficult to
      organize them in a compact way. Here we provide a novel analysis of those cuts,
      that reveals the existence of various interesting structures. These can be exploited
      so that we can disentangle and collect only those cuts that are essential in
      computing the $5$-edge-connected components. This analysis may provide a clue

      graph can be represented by a graph with an edge labelling, such that an edge
      is present in the network if and only if the edge is assigned the corresponding
      time label. A journey is a labelled path in a temporal graph such that labels
      on successive edges of the path are increasing, and if all vertices admit journeys
      to all other vertices, the temporal graph is temporally connected. A temporal
      spanner is a sublabelling of the temporal graph such that temporal connectivity
      is maintained. The study of temporal spanners has raised interest since the
      early 2000''s. Essentially two types of studies have been conducted: the positive
      side where families of temporal graphs are shown to (deterministically or stochastically)
      admit sparse temporal spanners, and the negative side where constructions of
      temporal graphs with no sparse spanners are of importance. Often such studies
      considered temporal graphs with happy or simple labellings, which associate
      exactly one label per edge. In this paper, we focus on the negative side and
      consider proper labellings, where multiple labels per edge are allowed. More
      precisely, we aim to construct dense temporally connected graphs such that all
      labels are necessary for temporal connectivity. Our contributions are multiple:
      we present the first labellings maximizing a local density measure; exact or
      asymptotically tight results for basic graph families, which are then extended
      to larger graph families; an extension of an efficient temporal graph labelling
      generator; and overall denser labellings than previous work even when restricted

      e.g., routing, vulnerability detection, and biology analysis. While the top
      K shortest simple paths offer invaluable insights, computing them is time-consuming.
      For example, on a Twitter graph (61.6M vertices and 1.5B edges), the best parallel
      method needs about 20 minutes to get 128 shortest paths between two vertices.
      A key observation we made is existing works search K shortest paths from the
      original graph, while top K shortest paths only cover a meager portion of the
      original graph, e.g., less than 0.001% on a Twitter graph for K = 128. This
      paper introduces PeeK, a pruning-centric approach for KSP computation. First,
      PeeK applies K upper bound pruning to prune the vertices and edges that will
      not appear in any of the K shortest paths. Second, PeeK adaptively compacts
      the graph that, not only removes the deleted vertices or edges but also efficiently
      computes the downstream task. Furthermore, we design efficient techniques to
      parallelize and distribute PeeK. We compare PeeK with five algorithms on various
      graphs. For parallel computation with 32 threads, PeeK achieves 5.1\u00d7 and
      28.8\u00d7 speedup over the state-of-the-art for K = 8, 128, respectively. More
      importantly, when K increases, the runtime of PeeK is barely affected. In particular,
      when K increases from 2 to 128 (64\u00d7), the runtime of PeeK only increases
      1.1\u00d7, while the state-of-the-art method increases 10.3\u00d7.", "venue":

      is one of the most pressing issues confronting technology today. Experts in
      computer science anticipate that future supercomputers will be built on large-scale
      parallel processing. A system with multiple processors and memories will be
      used in such a computer. The interconnection network that allows communication
      between the system\u2019s processors and memories is a critical component of
      such systems. In the topic of interconnection networks for parallel computer
      architectures, graph embedding problems have grown in relevance. Network embedding
      has been recognized as a valuable method for developing efficient algorithms
      and simulating various architectures in parallel and distributed computing.
      In this paper, we obtain the maximum subgraph of the generalized Sierpinski
      graphs S ( n, m ) , n \u2265 2 , m \u2265 3, and calculate the minimum linear
      arrangement of generalized Sierpinski graphs by graph embeddings.", "venue":

      "We define a range of new coarse geometric invariants based on various graph-theoretic
      measures of complexity for finite graphs, including: treewidth, pathwidth, cutwidth,
      search number, topological bandwidth, bandwidth, minimal linear arrangment,
      sumcut, profile, vertex and edge separation. We prove that, for bounded degree
      graphs, these invariants can be used to define functions which satisfy a strong
      monotonicity property, namely they are monotonically non-decreasing with respect
      to regular maps, and as such have potential applications in coarse geometry
      and geometric group theory. On the graph-theoretic side, we prove asymptotically
      optimal upper bounds on the treewidth, pathwidth, cutwidth, search number, topological
      bandwidth, vertex separation, edge separation, minimal linear arrangement, sumcut
      and profile for the family of all finite subgraphs of any bounded degree graph
