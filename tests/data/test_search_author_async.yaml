      "title": "Dystopian or Utopian? Two Images of Alan Turing", "abstract": "Turing
      made intriguing statements about the future of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI)
      in society. He predicted that machines would eventually \u2018compete with men
      in all purely intellectual \ufb01elds,\u2019 and added that at some stage they
      could be expected \u2018to take control.\u2019 Turing has been associated by
      his biographer, Andrew Hodges, with Dr. Frankenstein from Mary Shelley\u2019s
      dystopian novel. However, he has also been described by his contemporary Geoffrey
      Jefferson as a \u2018scienti\ufb01c\u2019 Percy B. Shelley, the English Romantic
      poet who was posthumously championed as a utopian and radical thinker. This
      article then asks: in what way did Turing envision a society permeated with
      intelligent machines? Did he see it as a utopia or a dystopia? These questions
      are thoroughly examined using Turing\u2019s own texts and related sources. This
      study reconstructs Turing\u2019s historical context in postwar England and analyzes
      his irony and sense of humor, as well as the in\ufb02uence of Samuel Butler
      on his vision. Contrary to recent views in AI science and \ufb01ction, on the
      one hand, a mismatch is shown between Turing and the incautious Frankenstein;
      on the other hand, Turing\u2019s radical Shelley-like qualities are substantiated.
      The article shows that Turing\u2019s utopianism entrusted intelligent machines
      with the task of teaching lessons of rationality and intellectual integrity
      over our place in nature and prejudices. Further, Turing\u2019s irony is shown
      to have targeted intellectuals who sacri\ufb01ce independent thinking to retain
      their power. These, he hoped, would be eventually rivaled and surpassed by intelligent
      machines.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount":

      "title": "Review of two collections of essays about Alan Turing", "abstract":
      "2012 was the Alan Turing Year \u2014 the celebration of the 100th anniversary
      of Alan Turing\u2019s birth. Turing\u2019s biographer Andrew Hodges in the \u201cForward\u201d
      to The Turing Guide comments that \u201cTuring\u2019s centenary year reflected
      a general public sense that the issues of Alan Turing\u2019s life and work are
      as relevant as ever in the twentyfirst century.\u201d The Turing Guide consists
      of 42 essays that are written for general readers and that celebrate Turing\u2019s:
      life (38 pages), accomplishments in mathematics (44 pages), codebreaking (120
      pages), On Computable Numbers and the Turing machine (36 pages), postwar work
      on computers (67 pages), contributions to morphogenesis (32 pages), ideas related
      to machine intelligence (86 pages), and legacy (32 pages). Eleven essays deal
      directly with codebreaking. Copeland either wrote, participated in the writing
      of, or revised 16 of the essays. Of the eight essays in the section \u201cArtificial
      Intelligence and the Mind,\u201d three were written by Diane Proudfoot and one
      includes her as a coauthor with Copeland (who wrote one other essay and coauthored
      a third essay in that section). The book begins with an overview of Turing\u2019s
      life and work by Copeland and Bowen. The essay is mostly a timeline of Turing\u2019s
      life. The authors suggest that Turing\u2019s death might have been accidental.
      Chapter 3, \u201cMeeting a Genius\u201d (4 pages), is by mathematician and Bletchley
      Park codebreaker Peter Hilton (1923\u20132010). Notes to the chapter (p. 485)
      state that the chapter was \u201cassembled by Jack Copeland\u201d and \u201cpublished
      with the permission of [Hilton\u2019s] wife.\u201d It is also noted that \u201c[in]
      2001 and again in 2002 [Hilton] visited Copeland at the University of Canterbury
      in New Zealand, where he delivered lectures on Turing and codebreaking. [The]
      chapter is a compilation of extracts from [Hilton\u2019s] papers and notes left
      in New Zealand, together with extracts from [Hilton\u2019s]", "venue": "Cryptologia",

      network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this
      paper. The network is self-organized by \"learning without a teacher\", and
      acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical
      similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This
      network is given a nickname \"neocognitron\". After completion of self-organization,
      the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous
      system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer
      (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular
      structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a
      cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \"S-cells'', which show
      characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and
      the second layer consists of \"C-cells\" similar to complex cells or higher
      order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity
      and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We
      do not need any \"teacher\" during the process of selforganization, and it is
      only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer
      of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After
      repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern
      has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer,
      and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus
      pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than
      one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected
      by the pattern''s position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change
      in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount":

      "title": "Five 1951 BBC Broadcasts on Automatic Calculating Machines", "abstract":
      "Researchers of Britain\u2019s early postwar history of computing have known
      for some time that a series of five British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio
      broadcasts under the general title of \u201cAutomatic Calculating Machines\u201d
      was broadcast on the BBC\u2019s Third Programme radio service in May\u2013June
      1951. In these broadcasts, five British pioneers of computing spoke about their
      work. In the order of their broadcasts, they were Douglas Hartree, Max Newman,
      Alan Turing, Frederic (\u201cFreddie\u201d) Williams, and Maurice Wilkes. Apart
      from Turing\u2019s broadcast, which has been discussed by B. Jack Copeland1
      and Andrew Hodges,2 these broadcasts have received little attention from historians
      of computing. No sound recordings of the broadcasts survive, although they all
      were recorded on acetate phonograph discs prior to transmission. However, texts
      of all five broadcasts survive as BBC transcripts, which were taken from the
      recordings shortly after they were made. These transcripts are held at the BBC\u2019s
      Written Archives Centre in Caversham, near Reading, and are the basis for this
      article. In addition to the existence of the five BBC transcripts, three of
      the speakers\u2019 scripts are known to have survived. These are Turing\u2019s,
      held at the Alan Turing archive at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, and those
      of Wilkes and Newman, copies of which are held by Wilkes. Turing\u2019s script
      has been published,3 although curiously not in the Collected Works of A.M. Turing,4

      "title": "Computer poker", "abstract": "Games are an interesting and challenging
      domain for computer science research, having the nice characteristics of a clearly
      deened set of rules and a speciic goal. Developing a program to play a strategic
      game well often involves the application of theoretical concepts to practical
      situations, and the relative success of that endeavour can be measured with
      quantiiable results. The game of poker is logistically simple yet strategically
      complex, and ooers many properties not exhibited by chess, checkers, and most
      other well-studied games. Most importantly, poker is a non-deterministic game
      with imperfect (hidden) information. Handling unreliable or incomplete information
      is a fundamental problem in computer science, and poker provides an excellent
      domain for investigating problems of decision making under conditions of uncertainty.
      Somewhat surprisingly, the potential beneets of studying poker have been largely
      overlooked by computer scientists and game researchers. In this essay we survey
      what resources are available for academic researchers, and lay some foundations
      for the sci-entiic exploration of this fascinating game.", "venue": "", "year":

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence : Usfssg Computers to Think about Thinking
      . Part 1", "abstract": "In 1950, Alan M. Turing, the late deputy director of
      the University of Manchester\u2019s Computing Laboratory in England, proposed
      a novel test to determine whether a machine was capable of thinking. In thk
      test, an interrogator has a teletype conversation with a man and a woman, both
      of whom must try to convince the interrogator that they are the woman. At some
      point unknown to the interrogator, the man is replaced by a machine. If the
      interrogator is fooled as often by the machine as by the man, that machine can
      be said to have displayed intelligent behavior. 1 Some 30 years after Turing
      proposed this test, many aspects of human behavior have been simulated by a
      computer. Programs have been designed to play checkersz and chess,J prove mathematical
      theorems ,4,5 and even mimic the behavior of a paranoid human being.b Despite
      the success of these and many other programs, none of the researchers investigating
      what\u2019s been variously cafled \u201capplied epistemology\u201d or \u201cartificial
      intelligence\u201d (AI) would claim this means the \u201cthinking machine\u201d
      has arrived. Instead, they would agree that these programs have contributed
      important information about human behavior, and how computers can simulate it.
      The first part of this two-part essay will review some of the theones AI researchers
      have developed to explain human \u201cinformation processing.\u201d The second
      part of the essay will cover some applications of AI research. These include
      programs used in robotics, programs that communicate with computer users in
      natural languages such as English, and \u201cexpert systems\u201d which help
      chemists, physicians, and others perform decision-making tasks. The \u201cpioneer\u201d
      expert system, DENDRAL, will be discussed in some detail.T.~ AI grew out of
      the convergence of ideas in several different fields, and the availability of
      new technologies. According to Avrom Barr and Edward A. Feigenbaum, Stanford
      University, California, the single most important factor contributing to the
      birth of the field was the invention of the computer.9 They point out that human
      beings have always drawn analogies between mechanical devices and their own
      behavior. Computers, with their memories and information-processing abilities,
      naturafly invited analogies with the human brain. Shortly after digital computers
      became available, computer scientists began creating programs that, they hoped,
      would perform tasks generally considered to require intelligence. Their earliest
      efforts were directed at programming computers to solve puzzles, play games
      such as chess, backgammon, and checkers, solve mathematical theorems, and translate
      text from one language to another. The early computer programs performed these
      tasks, but not very well. For example, chess programs were successful at following
      the step-by-step instructions for moving chessmen. But computers couldn\u2019t

      note is concerned with the logical formalism with types recently introduced
      by Church [1] (and called (C) in this note) It was shewn in his paper (Theorem
      26\u03b1) that if Y\u03b1 stands for (a form of the \u201caxiom of infinity\u201d
      for the type \u03b1), Y\u03b1 can be proved formally, from Y\u03b9 and the axioms
      1 to 7, for all types \u03b1 of the forms \u03b9\u2032, \u03b9\u2033, \u2026.
      For other types the question was left open, but for the purposes of an intrinsic
      characterisation of the Church type-stratification given by one of us, it is
      desirable to have the remaining cases cleared up. A formal proof of Y\u03b1
      is now given for all types \u03b1 containing \u03b9, but the proof uses, in
      addition to Axioms 1 to 7 and Y\u03b9, also Axiom 9 (in connection with Def.
      4), and Axiom 10 (in Theorem 9).", "venue": "Journal of Symbolic Logic (JSL)",

      logical system, if its use is to be carried beyond a rather elementary stage,
      needs powerful conventions about abbreviations: in particular one usually wants
      to modify the bracketing so as to make the formulae more readable, and also
      possibly shorter. The present note has been written in the belief that Church''s
      formulation of the simple theory of types is particularly suitable as a basis
      for work on that theory, and that it is therefore worth while introducing special
      conventions which take into account the needs of this particular system. The
      conventions which I shall describe are ones which I have used a good deal myself,
      and have always found adequate. I intend to make use of them in forthcoming
      papers. They may be regarded as an extension of Curry''s conventions. I shall
      begin with a general discussion of punctuation by means of groups of dots. This
      general theory is applicable, with some modifications, to Russell''s, Quine''s,
      and Curry''s bracketing systems as well as to the present one.", "venue": "Journal

      have been given to express an exact meaning corresponding to the intuitive idea
      of \u2018effective calculability\u2019 as applied for instance to functions
      of positive integers. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the computable
      functions introduced by the author are identical with the \u03bb-definable functions
      of Church and the general recursive functions due to Herbrand and G\u00f6del
      and developed by Kleene. It is shown that every \u03bb-definable function is
      computable and that every computable function is general recursive. There is
      a modified form of \u03bb-definability, known as \u03bb-K-definability, and
      it turns out to be natural to put the proof that every \u03bb-definable function
      is computable in the form of a proof that every \u03bb-K-definable function
      is computable; that every \u03bb-definable function is \u03bb-K-definable is
      trivial. If these results are taken in conjunction with an already available
      proof that every general recursive function is \u03bb-definable we shall have
      the required equivalence of computability with \u03bb-definability and incidentally
      a new proof of the equivalence of \u03bb-definability and \u03bb-K-definability.
      A definition of what is meant by a computable function cannot be given satisfactorily
      in a short space. I therefore refer the reader to Computable pp. 230\u2013235
      and p. 254. The proof that computability implies recursiveness requires no more

      \u2014 Alan Turing Centenary Special Issue", "abstract": "Preface We can only
      see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.
      Year 2012 is both the centenary of Alan Turing''s birth and the 60th anniversary
      of the famous paper The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, in which he established
      foundations of the mathematical theory of biological and chemical pattern formation.
      The story started much earlier, in spring 1923, as documented by his mother
      in a caricature entitled Hockey or Watching the Daisies Grow. Crucial motif
      in the drawing is that, while most players are engaged by the game, Alan is
      investigating a flower emerging just off the field. Always fascinated by the
      relationship between matter and spirit, especially in the processes of thinking
      , Turing started from the assumption that the operation of human brain is completely
      physical. This led him to invention of an abstract computing machine named after
      him, which laid the foundations of modern computer science. In recognition of
      his enormous contribution to the growth of the field, the most prestigious award
      in computer science, called \" Nobel Prize of computing \" , is named after
      Turing. Success has many fathers, but it was Alan Turing to whom we owe the
      final breaking of the Enigma code. He extended the idea of so-called \" Cryptology
      bombs \" , i.e., machines aimed at breaking codes, constructed before World
      War II by Polish mathematicians: Rejewski, R\u00f3\u02d9 zycki and Zygalski.
      His solution ensured the information advantage of the Allies during the Battle
      of the Atlantic, which had a direct bearing on the success of operations in
      Normandy and the defeat of Nazi Germany. After the war, Turing took up marathon
      running to relieve the stress, studied why spots on the leop-ard''s body are
      in the shape of a rosette or ring, and proposed a test to measure the machine''s
      ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. For this last reason, Turing is regarded
      as a founder of artificial intelligence. He left this world prematurely in the
      age of 42, but managed to finish the race with the highest score, in fact more
      than one race.. . In this special issue, we present a selection of papers commemorating
      Alan Turing and arguing that he should be also considered the co-founder of
      biomathematics and bioinformatics. His late works were", "venue": "", "year":

      "I propose to consider the question, \"Can machines think?\" This should begin
      with definitions of the meaning of the terms \"machine\" and \"think.\" The
      definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use
      of the words, but this attitude is dangerous. If the meaning of the words \"machine\"
      and \"think\" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is
      difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question,
      \"Can machines think?\" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup
      poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace
      the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in
      relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the problem can be described in
      terms of a game which we call the \"imitation game.\" It is played with three
      people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either
      sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart'' from the other two. The object
      of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the
      man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end
      of the game he says either \"X is A and Y is B\" or \"X is Band Y is A.\" The
      interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: C: Will X please tell
      me the length of his or her hair? Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer.
      It is A''s object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification.
      His answer might therefore be: \"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands
      are about nine inches long. \" 11", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount":

      "title": "Some Calculations of the Riemann Zeta-Function", "abstract": "Introduction
      IN June 1950 the Manchester University Mark 1 Electronic Computer was used to
      do some calculations concerned with the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann
      zeta-function. It was intended in fact to determine whether there are any zeros
      not on the critical line in certain particular intervals. The calculations had
      been planned some time in advance, but had in fact to be carried out in great
      haste. If it had not been for the fact that the computer remained in serviceable
      condition for an unusually long period from 3 p.m. one afternoon to 8 a.m. the
      following morning it is probable that the calculations would never have been
      done at all. As it was, the interval 2TT.63 < t < 2?r.64 was investigated during
      that period, and very little more was accomplished. The calculations were done
      in an optimistic hope that a zero would be found off the critical line, and
      the calculations were directed more towards finding such zeros than proving
      that none existed. The procedure was such that if it had been accurately followed,
      and if the machine made no errors in the period, then one could be sure that
      there were no zeros off the critical line in the interval in question. In practice
      only a few of the results were checked by repeating the calculation, so that
      the machine might well have made an error. If more time had been available it
      was intended to do some more calculations in an altogether different spirit.
      There is no reason in principle why computation should not be carried through
      with the rigour usual in mathematical analysis. If definite rules are laid down
      as to how the computation is to be done one can predict bounds for the errors
      throughout. When the computations are done by hand there are serious practical
      difficulties about this. The computer will probably have his own ideas as to
      how certain steps should be done. When certain steps may be omitted without
      serious loss of accuracy he will wish to do so. Furthermore he will probably
      not see the point of the ''rigorous'' computation and will probably say ''If
      you want more certainty about the accuracy why not just take more figures?''
      an argument difficult to counter. However, if the calculations are being done
      by an automatic computer one can feel sure that this kind of indiscipline",

      "title": "The chemical basis of morphogenesis", "abstract": "It is suggested
      that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and
      diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of
      morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous,
      may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous
      equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion
      systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells,
      a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation
      is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are
      six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting
      form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account,
      for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves. A system
      of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears
      to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives
      rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary
      waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis.The purpose
      of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote
      may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory
      does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known
      physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding
      of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some
      elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all
      of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be
      found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.",

      linear transformations'' it is clear that we cannot hope to approximate a general
      Lie group with finite subgroups. I shall show that we cannot approximate even
      with groups which are ''approximately subgroups'': in fact the only approximable
      Lie groups are the compact Abelian groups. The key to the situation is again
      afforded by Jordan''s theorem, but it is not immediately applicable. It is necessary
      to find representations of the approximating groups whose degree depends only
      on the group approximated.", "venue": "", "year": 1938, "referenceCount": 0,

      by these two historians address an important but undervalued subject - the role
      of Canada in the American Civil War. Richard Reid has examined the role of African-Canadian
      soldiers fighting in the civil war. John Boyko has attempted to provide a more
      general account of Canada''s experience of the civil war through the stories
      of six different Canadians.Richard Reid has made a meticulous study of the federal
      pension records and enlistment records to provide an account of African-Canadian
      experience in the American Civil War. He has taken on the daunting task of calculating
      the number of African-Canadians who actually participated in the war. Through
      painstaking research, he has identified 2,500 African-Canadians, resident in
      Canada, who fought for either the Union Army or Navy. Reid has demonstrated
      that Canadian participation was roughly equivalent to that of the New England
      states. Previous historians have portrayed the role of Canadianborn soldiers
      in the civil war as either mercenaries or victims of crimping (the illegal recruitment
      of soldiers through kidnapping or coercion). Reid amply demonstrates, at least
      in the case of African-Canadians, that this simply was not the case. He shows
      that the monetary benefits available for black soldiers through pay and bounties
      were unlikely to exceed what one could make by remaining in Canada, particularly
      for those with families. Furthermore, the timing of African-Canadian enrolment
      did not at all coincide with increasing bounties. Far more important in their
      decision-making was the equitable treatment of black soldiers. When black soldiers
      were first allowed to enrol, they found themselves limited by unequal pay, prevented
      from obtaining commissions and subject to excessive fatigue duty. There is little
      to object to in Reid''s new book. Perhaps one could have asked for a more in-depth
      account of how these black Canadian soldiers interacted with their American-born
      counterparts, and ideally he would provide more detail on how these soldiers
      related back to their friends and family in Canada, but the fragmentary nature
      of the source material likely makes such an endeavour unreasonable.Despite the
      seemingly narrow focus of the title, this book sheds light on a number of important
      issues: the issue of race in mid-nineteenth century North America; the porous
      border between the United States and Canada; and the importance of transnational
      ideologies and identities in the pre-Confederation era. Through a chapter on
      African-Canadian doctors, he tells the story of how blacks were able to break
      through into the medical industry in Canada more easily than in the United States.
      Later he demonstrates that the story does not simply end in 1865, as their war
      experiences influenced their lives long afterwards. \u2026", "venue": "", "year":

      "On 15th May, 1951, on the Third Programme, Alan gave his first broadcast, which
      was one of a series with the general title \u201cAutomatic Calculating Machines.\u201d
      His lecture, the second in the series, bore the sub-title, \u201cCan Digital
      Computers Think?\u201d I heard at his house its recording, but he stoutly refused
      to join me, though he plucked up courage to listen to its repetition on 3rd
      July, 1951. It was, as far as I know, generally agreed that he put his case
      very clearly. The other participants in the series were: Professor M.H.A. Newman,
      F.R.S.; Professor F.C. Williams, F.R.S.; and Mr. M.V. Wilkes (later F.R.S.),
      who gave no sub-title to their lectures. These talks were all reasonably long,
      not those very short affairs that stop just as one is beginning to get interested.
      These lectures were followed on 14th January, 1952, by a fourcornered broadcast
      discussion on the Third Programme between Professor Sir Geoffrey Jefferson,
      F.R.S., Professor M.H.A. Newman, F.R.S., Mr. R.B. Braithwaite, Fellow of King''s
      College, Cambridge, and Alan. The subject was, \u201cCan Automatic Calculating
      Machines be said to Think?\u201d Alan vigorously maintained, with some mild
      support from Professor Newman, that they could be said to think and bore the
      brunt of their opponents'' objections, particularly those of Sir Geoffrey Jefferson.
      The general impression of my non-expert friends was that the subject had been
      presented most amusingly and in such a way as to be, on the whole, within the
      comprehension of those to whom it was quite new.", "venue": "", "year": 2012,

      "title": "Generative Grammar", "abstract": "AuQ: Please provide information
      for Greenblatt et al. (See text.) This text has been added to the text as a
      placeholder for that reference. text has been added to the text as a placeholder
      for that reference. This text has been added to the text as a placeholder for
      that reference. The motivating idea of generative grammar is that we can gain
      insight into human language through the construction of explicit grammars. A
      language is taken to be a collection of structured symbolic expressions, and
      a generative grammar is simply an explicit theoretical account of one such collection.
      Simple finite sets of rules can describe infinite languages with interesting
      structure. For example, the following instruction describes all palindromes
      over the alphabet {A, B}: Start with S and recursively replace S by ASA, BSB,
      or nothing. We prove that ABBA is a palindrome by constructing the sequence
      S\u2014ASA\u2014ABSBA\u2014ABBA, which represents a derivation of the string.
      The instruction, or rule, constitutes a generative grammar for the language
      comprising such pal-indromes; for every palindrome over the alphabet {A,B} the
      grammar provides a derivation. S can be regarded as a grammatical category analogous
      to a sentence, and A and B are analogous to words in a language. The following
      condition on nodes in trees turns out to be equivalent to the above grammar:
      Nodes labeled S have left and right daughters either both labeled A or both
      labeled B; optionally these are separated by a node labeled S; nodes labeled
      A or B have no daughters. If a set of trees T satisfies this condition, then
      its frontier (the sequence of daughterless nodes) is a palindrome of A''s and
      B''s; and any such palindrome is the frontier of some such tree. This is a declarative
      definition of a set of trees, not a procedure for deriving strings. But it provides
      an alternative way of defining the same language of strings, a different type
      of generative grammar. Studying English in generative terms involves trying
      to determine whether some finite set of rules could generate the entire set
      of strings of words that a native speaker of (say) English would find acceptable.
      It presumably is possible , because speakers, despite their finite mental capacities,
      seem to have a full grasp of what is in their language. A fundamental early
      insight was that limitations on the format of rules or constraints set limits
      on definable languages , \u2026", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount":

      of reconciliation between Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism and McCarthy\u2019s
      epistemological point of view on artificial intelligence, which are at first
      glance likely to be considered contradictory. For this, characterizing the standpoint
      of J. McCarthy, who coined the word \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 as scientific
      realism and that of A. Turing, who provided a crucial thought experiment that
      shaped the contemporary conception of artificial intelligence as behaviorism,
      we shall compare these two standpoints with the transcendental idealism of I.
      Kant, who conferred on us a monumental indicator for understanding the human
      reason. T\ufeffhrough this comparison, we shall argue that scientific realism,
      which is currently a prominent philosophical standpoint of artificial intelligence,
      is not compatible with Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism but assumes a standpoint
      strikingly analogous to behaviorism. Nevertheless, we shall also argue that
      once transcendental idealism is looked at from the viewpoint of behaviorism,
      scientific realism can be seen as compatible with transcendental idealism. T\ufeffhis
      compatibility we name the possibility of artificial reason in this paper.",

      ELEMENTS DURING A SNOWFALL NEAR A BUILDING", "abstract": ". Atmospheric electrical
      elements during a snowfall near a building were examined by means of two dimensional
      numerical experiments which took into account a cylindrical building 10 m in
      radius and 22 m in height. Wilson''s selective ion capture process and the supplement
      of ions due to the corona discharge from the ground surface are considered in
      these experiments. As the electric field on the roof of the building is intensified,
      a corona discharge is liable to occur there and a large number of ions are emitted
      from the roof into the atmosphere. Although the ions move upward owing to the
      electric force, they cannot reach higher altitude and a high concentra tion
      of ions appear below a 40 m level. On the other hand, snow particles are rapidly
      electrified below the 60 m level. Therefore, ions emitted from the roof of the
      building are captured by snow particles and the charges on snow particles are
      released to the ground surface. These calculated results qualitatively agree
      with the observation results described in a previous paper (Asuma et al., 1988).",

      "title": "Reliable detection and characterization of low-frequency polarized
      sources in the LOFAR M51 field", "abstract": "Context. The new generation of
      broad-band radio continuum surveys will provide large data sets with polarization
      information. New algorithms need to be developed to extract reliable catalogs
      of linearly polarized sources that can be used to characterize those sources
      and produce a dense rotation measure (RM) grid to probe magneto-ionized structures
      along the line of sight via Faraday rotation.\nAims. The aim of the paper is
      to develop a computationally efficient and rigorously defined source-finding
      algorithm for linearly polarized sources.\nMethods. We used a calibrated data
      set from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 150 MHz centered on the nearby galaxy
      M 51 to search for polarized background sources. With a new imaging software,
      we re-imaged the field at a resolution of 18\u2033 \u00d7 15\u2033 and cataloged
      a total of about 3000 continuum sources within 2.5\u00b0 of the center of M
      51. We made small Stokes Q and U images centered on each source brighter than
      100 mJy in total intensity (201 sources) and used RM synthesis to create corresponding
      Faraday cubes that were analyzed individually. For each source, the noise distribution
      function was determined from a subset of the measurements at high Faraday depths
      where no polarization is expected; the peaks in polarized intensity in the Faraday
      spectrum were identified and the p-value of each source was calculated. Finally,
      the false discovery rate method was applied to the list of p-values to produce
      a list of polarized sources and quantify the reliability of the detections.
      We also analyzed sources fainter than 100 mJy but that were reported as polarized
      in the literature at at least another radio frequency.\nResults. Of the 201
      sources that were searched for polarization, six polarized sources were detected
      confidently (with a false discovery rate of 5%). This corresponds to a number
      density of one polarized source per 3.3 square degrees, or 0.3 source per square
      degree. Increasing the false discovery rate to 50% yields 19 sources. A majority
      of the sources have a morphology that is indicative of them being double-lobed
      radio galaxies, and the ones with literature redshift measurements have 0.5
      < z < 1.0.\nConclusions. We find that this method is effective in identifying
      polarized sources, and is well suited for LOFAR observations. In the future,
      we intend to develop it further and apply it to larger data sets such as the
      LOFAR Two-meter Survey of the whole northern sky, LOTSS, and the ongoing deep
      LOFAR observations of the GOODS-North field.", "venue": "Astronomy & Astrophysics",

      NGC 5322", "abstract": "We have analysed a new high-resolution e-MERLIN 1.5
      GHz radio continuum map together with HST and SDSS imaging of NGC 5322, an elliptical
      galaxy hosting radio jets, aiming to understand the galaxy\u2019s central structure
      and its connection to the nuclear activity. We decomposed the composite HST
      + SDSS surface brightness profile of the galaxy into an inner stellar disc,
      a spheroid, and an outer stellar halo. Past works showed that this embedded
      disc counter-rotates rapidly with respect to the spheroid. The HST images reveal
      an edge-on nuclear dust disc across the centre, aligned along the major-axis
      of the galaxy and nearly perpendicular to the radio jets. After careful masking
      of this dust disc, we find a central stellar mass deficit Mdef in the spheroid,
      scoured by SMBH binaries with final mass MBH such that Mdef/MBH \u223c 1.3 \u2212
      3.4. We propose a three-phase formation scenario for NGC 5322 where a few (2
      \u2212 7) \u2018dry\u2019 major mergers involving SMBHs built the spheroid with
      a depleted core. The cannibalism of a gas-rich satellite subsequently creates
      the faint counter-rotating disc and funnels gaseous material directly onto the
      AGN, powering the radio core with a brightness temperature of TB, core \u223c
      4.5 \u00d7 107 K and the low-power radio jets (Pjets \u223c 7.04 \u00d7 1020
      W Hz\u22121) which extend \u223c1.6 kpc. The outer halo can later grow via minor
      mergers and the accretion of tidal debris. The low-luminosity AGN/jet-driven
      feedback may have quenched the late-time nuclear star formation promptly, which
      could otherwise have replenished the depleted core.", "venue": "", "year": 2018,

      "The Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) is a legacy programme
      designed to map a set of nested fields totalling \u223c380\u2009deg^2. Fields
      range in size from 0.01 to \u223c20\u2009deg^2, using the Herschel-Spectral
      and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) (at 250, 350 and 500\u2009\u03bcm)
      and the Herschel-Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) (at 100
      and 160\u2009\u03bcm), with an additional wider component of 270\u2009deg^2
      with SPIRE alone. These bands cover the peak of the redshifted thermal spectral
      energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capture the reprocessed
      optical and ultraviolet radiation from star formation that has been absorbed
      by dust, and are critical for forming a complete multiwavelength understanding
      of galaxy formation and evolution. \n \nThe survey will detect of the order
      of 100\u2009000 galaxies at 5\u03c3 in some of the best-studied fields in the
      sky. Additionally, HerMES is closely coordinated with the PACS Evolutionary
      Probe survey. Making maximum use of the full spectrum of ancillary data, from
      radio to X-ray wavelengths, it is designed to facilitate redshift determination,
      rapidly identify unusual objects and understand the relationships between thermal
      emission from dust and other processes. Scientific questions HerMES will be
      used to answer include the total infrared emission of galaxies, the evolution
      of the luminosity function, the clustering properties of dusty galaxies and
      the properties of populations of galaxies which lie below the confusion limit
      through lensing and statistical techniques. \n \nThis paper defines the survey
      observations and data products, outlines the primary scientific goals of the
      HerMES team, and reviews some of the early results.", "venue": "", "year": 2012,

      "abstract": "Context. The 6.7 GHz methanol maser marks an early stage of high-mass
      star formation, but the origin of this maser is currently a matter of debate.
      In particular it is unclear whether the maser emission arises in discs, outflows
      or behind shocks running into rotating molecular clouds. Aims. We investigated
      which structures the methanol masers trace in the environment of high-mass protostar
      candidates by observing a homogenous sample of methanol masers selected from
      Torun surveys. We also probed their origins by looking for associated H II regions
      and IR emission. Methods. We selected 30 methanol sources with improved position
      accuracies achieved using MERLIN and another 3 from the literature. We imaged
      31 of these using the European VLBI Network\u2019s expanded array of telescopes
      with 5-cm (6-GHz) receivers. We used the VLA to search for 8.4 GHz radio continuum
      counterparts and inspected Spitzer GLIMPSE data at 3.6\u20138 \u03bcm from the
      archive. Results. High angular resolution images allowed us to analyze the morphology
      and kinematics of the methanol masers in great detail and verify their association
      with radio continuum and mid-infrared emission. A new class of \u201cring-like\u201d
      methanol masers in starforming regions appeared to be suprisingly common, 29%
      of the sample. Conclusions. The new morphology strongly suggests that methanol
      masers originate in the disc or torus around a proto- or a young massive star.
      However, the maser kinematics indicate the strong influence of outflow or infall.
      This suggests that they form at the interface between the disc/torus and a flow.
      This is also strongly supported by Spitzer results because the majority of the
      masers coincide with 4.5 \u03bcm emission to within less than 1 \ufffd\ufffd
      . Only four masers are associated with the central parts of UC H II regions.
      This implies that 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission occurs before H II region
      observable at cm wavelengths is formed.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount":

      The VDM2000 is image based and provides a criterion-independent measure of target
      conspicuity, referred to as the vehicle metric (VM). A large data set of human
      responses to photographs of military vehicles in a field setting was used to
      validate the model. The VM adjusted by a single calibration parameter accounts
      for approximately 80% of the variance in the validation data. The primary application
      of this model is to predict detection of military targets in daylight with the
      unaided eye. The model also has application to target detection prediction using
      infrared night vision systems. The model has potential as a tool to evaluate

      computer architectures. The references to Occam, Turing, and von Neumann are
      canonical. The reference to Jaynes is in the following context. Recently, cellular
      automata have been found to be \\unreasonably eeective\" in modeling by simple

      "title": "CSDs and Participant Default", "abstract": "Since the financial crisis
      there has been an increase in the degree and detail of regulation of CSDs, which
      are rightly recognised to be a core component in the smooth functioning of the
      financial system. One feature of the regulation of CSDs, as with other types
      of financial market infrastructure, is the requirement for default rules. The
      principal actions of a CSD when faced with a participant default will be to
      freeze the defaulter\u2019s accounts and cancel processing of unexecuted instructions.
      These actions are intended to protect the settlement system, and also appear
      to be a response to insolvency laws which disallow movements of an insolvent
      entity\u2019s property.<br><br>But the nature of \u2018default\u2019 has also
      changed since the crisis. In particular, there are new ways of dealing with
      failing firms, through resolution. This paper argues that how CSDs should react
      to the failure of a participating financial institution has lagged behind developments
      in the handling of financial firm failures. In particular, the freeze-and-cancel
      principle seems less necessary in the context of modern settlement processing,
      and at odds with the objective of resolution, which is to continue, or restore,
      critical functions without undue fuss or delay. Given that at least some participants
      in CSDs are intermediaries, whose accounts contain securities belonging to customers,
      the policy of freeze-and-cancel could add to the disruption caused by a firm\u2019s
      failure rather than reduce it.<br><br>The paper argues that there is no need
      for freeze-and-cancel as regards client securities, or even proprietary assets.
      Furthermore, the process of resolution, which commonly involves the transfer
      of client-facing functions to a \u2018bridge bank\u2019, seems not to be fully
      catered for in CSD default or membership rules. Trying to create new arrangements
      in an emergency over a resolution weekend seems a poor way to achieve continuity.
      It is therefore suggested that CSDs should overhaul their approach to membership
      in relation to bridge banks, and facilitate the transfer of client accounts
      during resolution.<br>", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 2, "citationCount":

      "title": "The Extra-Territorial Regulation of Clearinghouses", "abstract": "This
      Article argues that post-Crisis reform of over-the-counter derivatives is in
      trouble. While regulators agree on the broad strokes of regulation, they diverge
      on detail, often on core issues like how clearinghouses should manage risk.
      In examining divergences between United States and Europe, this Article makes
      three points. First, divergences in clearinghouse regulation matter in derivatives
      markets because these markets are uniquely international in scope. Contracts
      involve counterparties in different countries. Many transactions comprise cross-border
      aspects lacking a geographical anchor. Where derivatives traders face uncertainty,
      they can be dis-incentivized from observing laws or motivated to seek out lowest-cost
      compliance options. Secondly, although both the United States and European Union
      have adopted common ground-rules, their approaches to implementation differ
      in matters of detail. Such divergences prevent regulators from recognizing each
      other\u2019s clearinghouses as sufficiently robust. Thirdly, while acknowledging
      that mutual recognition is the most appropriate way forward, substantial shortcomings
      exist with this approach. This Article highlights continuing areas of structural
      divergence \u2013 like access to emergency funding and bailouts \u2013 that
      impact the costs of E.U. and U.S. regimes. Where costs diverge, traders seek
      out avenues for regulatory arbitrage to lower their costs of compliance. In
      concluding, this Article explores implications for reform.", "venue": "", "year":

      a classical reaction-diusion system undergoing Tur- ing instability and augment
      it by an additional unilateral source term. We investigate its inuence on the
      Turing instability and on the character of re- sulting patterns. The nonsmooth
      positively homogeneous unilateral term v has favourable properties in spite
      of the fact that the standard linear stability analysis cannot be performed.
      We illustrate the importance of the nonsmooth- ness by a numerical case study,
      which shows that the Turing instability can considerably change if we replace
      this term by its arbitrarily precise smooth approximation. However, the nonsmooth
      unilateral term and all its approxi- mations yield qualitatively same patterns
      although not necessarily developing from arbitrarily small disturbances of the
      spatially homogeneous steady state. Further, we show that inserting the unilateral
      source into a classical system breaks the approximate symmetry and regularity
      of the classical patterns and yields asymmetric and irregular patterns. Moreover,
      a given system with a unilateral source produces spatial patterns even for diusion
      parameters with ratios closer to 1 than the same system without any unilateral
      term. Biologi- cally, these ndings can contribute to the understanding of symmetry

      "abstract": "(technical evolutionism) does not necessarily result in more social
      morality (social evolutionism). But I do not suggest that we can blame Shurkin
      for not exploring this differing interpretation. After all, merging the technical
      and the social history of computing was not very typical for the first generation
      of the historiography of computing-Shurkin''s generation. The title of this
      work comes from an essay by Samuel Butler published in 1863, which illustrates
      the reach of this work and the scholarship on which it is based. George Dyson
      collects, relates, and extends what he sees as evidence that biology and technology
      reveal \" parallel tendencies toward collective, hierarchical processes based
      on information exchange \" (p. 7)-an evolutionary process, hence the reference
      to Charles Darwin. The biological evidence collected comes from Smee and is
      packaged in a fairly traditional reading. This evidence is, however , melded
      and contrasted with materials from the writings of from the computing area,
      especially relating to concerns in the cognitive sciences. The objective is
      to illustrate that development in information processing can be explained in
      a Darwinian fashion similar to explanations in biology. Dyson states: As information
      is distributed, it tends to be represented (encoded) in increasingly economical
      (meaningful) forms. This evolutionary process, whereby the most economical or
      meaningful representation wins, leads to a hierarchy of languages , encoding
      meaning on levels that transcend comprehension by the system''s individual components-whether
      genes, insects, microprocessors, or human minds (p. 8). Whether the reader concludes
      this is profound or bunkum depends on one''s attitude toward the presupposition
      behind this extended essay. That presupposition is the placement of machines
      on a par with organic life. Acceptance of this presupposition sidesteps any
      need to justify areas like artificial intelligence and questioning about when
      machines with artificial intelligence equal or exceed human capability. Dyson
      is not talking about computer programs and the existence of qualities in these
      programs (unknown to the developers) that exhibit evolutionary steps when they
      are revealed, a point I have also heard argued by the late Allen Newell. His
      analysis is much deeper than that. He is looking to see if a principle akin
      to natural selection in biology is operating in the machine domain, and many
      of his justifications come from computing. We may be asking too much of the
      Darwinian principle of natural selection when we apply it to machines and nebulae.

      "STUDY OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the efficacy and toxicity of intralesionally
      administered interferons in the treatment of condyloma acuminatum.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized,
      double-blind, and placebo-controlled study.\n\n\nSETTING\nOutpatient clinics
      at university medical centers.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nSeventy-nine patients with biopsy-proved
      condyloma acuminatum that was refractory to conventional therapy were enrolled
      in the study.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nAlpha-2b, alpha-nl-, and beta-interferons
      were used. One wart on each patients was injected three times per week for 4
      weeks with either 1 x 10(6) units of interferon or placebo.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS
      AND MAIN RESULTS\nForty-seven percent of warts injected with interferon resolved
      completely, compared with 22% of placebo-injected warts (P = 0.009). In addition,
      more recipients of interferon had a complete resolution of uninjected lesions.
      No differences in rates of response were noted among the different interferon
      groups. Approximately one third of interferon-injected warts recurred, compared
      with none of four placebo-injected warts. Intralesionally administered interferon
      was nontoxic and well tolerated, although transient pain on injection was observed
      frequently.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIntralesional administration of each of these
      three interferons appears to be useful in treating condyloma acuminatum. However,
      the frequent recurrence of disease and the failure of many lesions to resolve
      indicate that different regimens, such as longer courses of therapy or different
      routes of administration, should be evaluated to maximize beneficial effects
      of interferon for treating this common sexually transmitted disease.", "venue":

      Twin of the Active Electronically Scanned Array", "abstract": "A weather radar
      using an active electronically scanned array (AESA) enables rapid scanning of
      the antenna beam for Doppler and polarimetric radar observation measurements.
      An AESA consists of radiating elements, power amplifiers, attenuators, phase
      shifters, array controllers, and digital converters. This paper describes a
      digital twin, the AESA Simulator, which models both the AESA and weather radar
      returns, developed to explore and validate the optimal configuration of the
      APAR subsystems. Using a hybrid digital beamforming architecture, multiple,
      simultaneous receive beams are realized upon reception. Traditional analog beamforming
      will be performed along each row, while digital beamforming will be performed
      across the per-row outputs of the AESA. The simulator sums over a spatial grid,
      rather than using a prescribed antenna pattern, in order to support testing
      of multiple receive beams, clutter mitigation algorithms, and other developments
      that require accurate modeling of spatial diversity. The digital twin allowed
      NCAR/EOL to accelerate the timeline for engineering development of the APAR
      radar back end (RBE) and provides the necessary configurability to conform to
      the eventual AESA digital data acquisition and control interfaces as AESA and
      RBE development converge. Together the simulator and RBE are used to evaluate/validate
      the radar at the system level.", "venue": "IEEE International Symposium on Phased

      "title": "Alan M. Turing: Broadcasts and Intelligent Machinery", "abstract":
      "On 15th May, 1951, on the Third Programme, Alan gave his first broadcast, which
      was one of a series with the general title \u201cAutomatic Calculating Machines.\u201d
      His lecture, the second in the series, bore the sub-title, \u201cCan Digital
      Computers Think?\u201d I heard at his house its recording, but he stoutly refused
      to join me, though he plucked up courage to listen to its repetition on 3rd
      July, 1951. It was, as far as I know, generally agreed that he put his case
      very clearly. The other participants in the series were: Professor M.H.A. Newman,
      F.R.S.; Professor F.C. Williams, F.R.S.; and Mr. M.V. Wilkes (later F.R.S.),
      who gave no sub-title to their lectures. These talks were all reasonably long,
      not those very short affairs that stop just as one is beginning to get interested.
      These lectures were followed on 14th January, 1952, by a fourcornered broadcast
      discussion on the Third Programme between Professor Sir Geoffrey Jefferson,
      F.R.S., Professor M.H.A. Newman, F.R.S., Mr. R.B. Braithwaite, Fellow of King''s
      College, Cambridge, and Alan. The subject was, \u201cCan Automatic Calculating
      Machines be said to Think?\u201d Alan vigorously maintained, with some mild
      support from Professor Newman, that they could be said to think and bore the
      brunt of their opponents'' objections, particularly those of Sir Geoffrey Jefferson.
      The general impression of my non-expert friends was that the subject had been
      presented most amusingly and in such a way as to be, on the whole, within the
      comprehension of those to whom it was quite new.", "venue": "", "year": 2012,

      method is an informal one, and attempts to characterise effectiveness, such
      as the above, lack rigour, for the key requirement that the method demand no
      insight or ingenuity is left unexplicated. One of Turing''s achievements in
      his paper of 1936 was to present a formally exact predicate with which the informal
      predicate \u2018can be calculated by means of an effective method\u2019 may
      be replaced. Church did the same (1936a). The replacement predicates that Turing
      and Church proposed were, on the face of it, very different from one another,
      but they turned out to be equivalent, in the sense that each picks out the same
      set of mathematical functions. The Church-Turing thesis is the assertion that
      this set contains every function whose values can be obtained by a method satisfying
      the above conditions for effectiveness. (Clearly, if there were functions of
      which the informal predicate, but not the formal predicate, were true, then
      the latter would be less general than the former and so could not reasonably
      be employed to replace it.) When the thesis is expressed in terms of the formal
      concept proposed by Turing, it is appropriate to refer to the thesis also as
      \u2018Turing''s thesis\u2019; and mutatis mutandis in the case of Church.",

      of revolution\u2019. In so doing, they demonstrated an ideology eerily similar
      to that of the American Patriots three quarters of a century earlier. They held
      a conditional conception of loyalty as a social contract between monarch and
      subject. The British Crown was seen to have broken this contract through its
      sanctioning of the Rebellion Losses Bill and its implicit support of \u2018French

      you will be welcomed into federal court. On its face, this seems like a straightforward
      process. However, consider the following example: John and Mike enter an agreement

      chooses to compel arbitration and seeks $100,000 from Mike. After the arbitration,
      John is awarded $70,000. John sues in federal court to confirm the arbitration
      award. Assuming John is seeking to establish diversity jurisdiction, John will
      have to satisfy the $75,000 amount in controversy requirement. Is the amount
      in controversy satisfied because John originally sought $100,000, or is $70,000
      the amount in controversy in this dispute? The obvious answer is to look at
      how courts have handled similar disputes. Unfortunately, the answer will change

      the level of praise that has been lavished on Turing is justified. Yes, the
      1936 paper in which he defined what are now known as Turing machines is a landmark
      in the history of science, but other logicians at the time were involved in
      the development of formal models of computation, including Herbrand, G\u00f6del,
      Post, and Church. And, although Turing played an important part in the development
      of the modern electronic computer, his role should not be overstated: a number
      of early computing devices were built from the late 1930\u2019s to mid-1940\u2019s
      with little or no influence of Turing\u2019s early foundational work, and the
      real history involves a complex mix of theoretical and practical insights, with
      contributions from a substantial cast of researchers and engineers alongside
      Turing. Finally, although the hideous abuses that Turing was subjected to as
      a homosexual in postwar Britain are made even more ironic by the role he played
      in helping the allies win the war, those abuses are no more morally offensive
      than those suffered by countless others whose lives are left uncelebrated. With
      all this in mind, it is reasonable to ask: was all the hoopla really called
      for? One need only sit down with Turing\u2019s work for an hour or two, however,
      to find such doubts pushed aside. His papers are full of technical detail, but
      are surprisingly easy to read. His writing is careful and methodical, but even
      after all these years the work feels creatively fresh and original. He dealt
      with weighty topics and raised important questions, but relied on technical
      mastery and a good deal of hard work to back up his answers. When we read",

      effects on patient outcomes: Evaluation via simulation", "abstract": "Where
      performance comparison of healthcare providers is of interest, characteristics
      of both patients and the health condition of interest must be balanced across
      providers for a fair comparison. This is unlikely to be feasible within observational
      data, as patient population characteristics may vary geographically and patient
      care may vary by characteristics of the health condition. We simulated data
      for patients and providers, based on a previously utilized real-world dataset,
      and separately considered both binary and continuous covariate-effects at the
      upper level. Multilevel latent class (MLC) modelling is proposed to partition
      a prediction focus at the patient level (accommodating casemix) and a causal
      inference focus at the provider level. The MLC model recovered a range of simulated
      Trust-level effects. Median recovered values were almost identical to simulated
      values for the binary Trust-level covariate, and we observed successful recovery
      of the continuous Trust-level covariate with at least 3 latent Trust classes.
      Credible intervals widen as the error variance increases. The MLC approach successfully
      partitioned modelling for prediction and for causal inference, addressing the
      potential conflict between these two distinct analytical strategies. This improves
      upon strategies which only adjust for differential selection. Patient-level
      variation and measurement uncertainty are accommodated within the latent classes.",

      we introduce a new class of probabilistic graphical models called the Reduced
      Dynamic Chain Event Graph (RDCEG) which is a novel mixture of a Chain Event
      Graph (CEG) and a semi-Markov process (SMP). It has been demonstrated that many
      real-world scenarios, particularly in the domain of public health and security,
      can be modelled as an unfolding of events in the life histories of individuals.
      Our interest not only lies in the future trajectories of an individual with
      a specified history and set of characteristics but also in the timescale associated
      with these developments. Such information is critical in developing suitable
      interventions and informs the prioritisation of policy decisions. The RDCEG
      was born out of the need for such a model. It is a coloured graph which inherits
      useful properties like fast conjugate model selection, conditional independence
      interrogations and a support for causal interventions from the family of probabilistic
      graphical models. Its novelty lies in its underlying semi-Markov structure which
      offers the flexibility of the holding time at each state being any arbitrary
      distribution. We demonstrate this new decision support system with a simulated
      intervention to reduce falls in the elderly.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      "title": "An AI tool for automated analysis of large-scale unstructured clinical
      cine CMR databases", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have
      been proposed for automating analysis of short axis (SAX) cine cardiac magnetic
      resonance (CMR), but no CMR analysis tool exists to automatically analyse large
      (unstructured) clinical CMR datasets. We develop and validate a robust AI tool
      for start-to-end automatic quantification of cardiac function from SAX cine
      CMR in large clinical databases. Our pipeline for processing and analysing CMR
      databases includes automated steps to identify the correct data, robust image
      pre-processing, an AI algorithm for biventricular segmentation of SAX CMR and
      estimation of functional biomarkers, and automated post-analysis quality control
      to detect and correct errors. The segmentation algorithm was trained on 2793
      CMR scans from two NHS hospitals and validated on additional cases from this
      dataset (n=414) and five external datasets (n=6888), including scans of patients
      with a range of diseases acquired at 12 different centres using CMR scanners
      from all major vendors. Median absolute errors in cardiac biomarkers were within
      the range of inter-observer variability:<8.4mL (left ventricle volume),<9.2mL
      (right ventricle volume),<13.3g (left ventricular mass), and<5.9% (ejection
      fraction) across all datasets. Stratification of cases according to phenotypes
      of cardiac disease and scanner vendors showed good performance across all groups.
      We show that our proposed tool, which combines image pre-processing steps, a
      domain-generalisable AI algorithm trained on a large-scale multi-domain CMR
      dataset and quality control steps, allows robust analysis of (clinical or research)
      databases from multiple centres, vendors, and cardiac diseases. This enables
      translation of our tool for use in fully-automated processing of large multi-centre
      databases.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 32, "citationCount":

      "abstract": "The XENON1T experiment uses a time projection chamber (TPC) with
      liquid Xenon to search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), a proposed
      Dark Matter particle, via direct detection. As this experiment relies on capturing
      rare events, the focus is on achieving a high recall of WIMP events. Hence the
      ability to distinguish between WIMP and the background is extremely important.
      To accomplish this, we suggest using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs); a
      Machine Learning procedure mainly used in image recognition tasks. To explore
      this technique we use XENON collaboration open-source software to simulate the
      TPC graphical output of Dark Matter signals and main backgrounds. A CNN turns
      out to be a suitable tool for this purpose, as it can identify features in the
      images that differentiate the two types of events without the need to manipulate
      or remove data in order to focus on a particular region of the detector. We
      find that the CNN can distinguish between the dominant background events (ER)
      and 500 GeV WIMP events with a recall of 93.4\\%, precision of 81.2\\% and an
      accuracy of 87.2\\%.", "venue": "Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle

      vertical orientations. We illustrate our approach on schlieren images taken
      from a wind tunnel sting model, a supersonic aircraft in flight, and a high-order
      numerical shock tube simulation.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":
