      Large-Scale Generative Language Model", "abstract": "Pretrained general-purpose
      language models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in various natural language
      processing domains by adapting to downstream tasks via zero-shot, few-shot and
      fine-tuning techniques. Because of their success, the size of these models has
      increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic
      techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort
      between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest
      monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG),
      with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure
      as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed
      and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
      corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
      to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results,
      as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
      We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
      accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.
      We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale
      training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language
      generations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount":

      hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is
      presented explicitly as a physical principle: \u2018every finitely realizible
      physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine
      operating by finite means\u2019. Classical physics and the universal Turing
      machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey
      the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing
      machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines
      is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ''universal quantum
      computer\u2019 are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling
      the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have
      many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do
      not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include
      \u2018quantum parallelism\u2019, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks
      can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
      restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable
      strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett\u2019s. Some
      of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the
      rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically
      more reasonable definition of the \u2018complexity\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019

      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands,
      which prove to be better for water desalination. Science, this issue p. 518
      Turing structures generated via diffusion-driven instabilities make polyamide
      membranes for water desalination. The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental
      importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications
      have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based
      on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for
      water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions
      enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes
      exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound
      line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence
      of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport
      through the membranes is enhanced.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "title": "Dissecting the NVidia Turing T4 GPU via Microbenchmarking", "abstract":
      "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs, coupled
      with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a hurdle
      for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
      Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
      using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s
      latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine
      Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations.
      Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications.
      We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the
      P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
      higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study
      the performance of the T4''s TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on
      low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces
      new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s
      instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions.
      We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as
      the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large
      as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4
      memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over
      its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
      workloads that hit power or thermal limits. \nMany of our findings are novel,
      published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software
      developers get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "Stochastic Turing patterns in a synthetic bacterial population", "abstract":
      "Significance In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could
      arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing
      inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing\u2019s conditions are disappointingly
      hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts
      pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered
      bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor
      system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered
      patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively
      with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms,
      driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much
      broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin of biological
      morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our
      understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952,
      Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability
      of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion
      systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing
      activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and
      the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called
      into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator\u2013inhibitor
      birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts
      the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with
      no severe requirement on the ratio of activator\u2013inhibitor diffusion coefficients.
      To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically
      engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules
      form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming
      gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered
      bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale
      much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental
      patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These
      results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity,
      can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings
      provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising
      from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.",

      as malignant or benign is still an underlying challenge. To address this challenge,
      radiologists need computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can assist in
      learning discriminative imaging features corresponding to malignant and benign
      nodules. However, learning highly discriminative imaging features is an open
      problem. In this paper, our aim is to learn the most discriminative features
      pertaining to lung nodules by using an adversarial learning methodology. Specifically,
      we propose to use un-supervised learning with Deep Convolutional-Generative
      Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) to generate lung nodule samples realistically.
      We hypothesize that imaging features of lung nodules will be discriminative
      if it is hard to differentiate them (fake) from real (true) nodules. To test
      this hypothesis, we present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order
      to evaluate the quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons
      are performed in discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules.
      This experimental set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated
      nodules, which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining
      highly discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational

      but less is known concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous
      media. It is non-trivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent
      spatial heterogeneity from emergent patterning due to nonlinear instability.
      We employ WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
      which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions. We find that the
      structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical trigonometric
      functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of different growth
      rates are localized to different spatial regions. This localization helps explain
      common amplitude modulations observed in simulations of Turing systems in heterogeneous
      settings. We numerically demonstrate this theory, giving an illustrative example
      of the emergent instabilities and the striking complexity arising from spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion systems. Our results give insight both
      into systems driven by exogenous heterogeneity, as well as successive pattern
      forming processes, noting that most scenarios in biology do not involve symmetry
      breaking from homogeneity, but instead consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous

      Spiking neural P systems with communication on request (SNQ P systems) are a

      paper studies a simplified version of SNQ P systems, i.e. SNQ P systems with

      the Turing universality of SNQ P systems. Theoretical results are shown in the
      cases of the SNQ P system used in both generating and accepting modes. Furthermore,
      the influence of the number of unbounded neurons (the number of spikes in a
      neuron is not bounded) on the computation power of SNQ P systems with one type

      researchers today believe that each finger forms because of its unique position
      within the early limb bud. However, 30 years ago, developmental biologists proposed
      that the arrangement of fingers followed the Turing pattern, a self-organizing
      process during early embryo development. Raspopovic et al. provide evidence
      to support a Turing mechanism (see the Perspective by Zuniga and Zeller). They
      reveal that Bmp and Wnt signaling pathways, together with the gene Sox9, form
      a Turing network. The authors used this network to generate a computer model
      capable of accurately reproducing the patterns that cells follow as the embryo
      grows fingers. Science, this issue p. 566; see also p. 516 Modeling and experiments
      reveal how limb digits are patterned by three components. [Also see Perspective
      by Zuniga and Zeller] During limb development, digits emerge from the undifferentiated
      mesenchymal tissue that constitutes the limb bud. It has been proposed that
      this process is controlled by a self-organizing Turing mechanism, whereby diffusible
      molecules interact to produce a periodic pattern of digital and interdigital
      fates. However, the identities of the molecules remain unknown. By combining
      experiments and modeling, we reveal evidence that a Turing network implemented
      by Bmp, Sox9, and Wnt drives digit specification. We develop a realistic two-dimensional
      simulation of digit patterning and show that this network, when modulated by
      morphogen gradients, recapitulates the expression patterns of Sox9 in the wild
      type and in perturbation experiments. Our systems biology approach reveals how
      a combination of growth, morphogen gradients, and a self-organizing Turing network

      "title": "Visual Turing test for computer vision systems", "abstract": "Significance
      In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods
      of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations
      measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according
      to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding.
      We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares
      a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to
      probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition
      to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy
      in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated
      by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a
      story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted
      device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given
      test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides
      the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes
      the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered
      to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s
      answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question.
      Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural
      language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned
      from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the
      answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,
      is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test
      is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions
      that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object,
      through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other
      uniquely instantiated objects.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy

      Vertebrates have a vast array of epithelial appendages, including scales, feathers,

      explained by Alan Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion system. However, the role
      of this system in epithelial appendage patterning of early diverging lineages
      (compared to tetrapods), such as the cartilaginous fishes, is poorly understood.
      We investigate patterning of the unique tooth-like skin denticles of sharks,
      which closely relates to their hydrodynamic and protective functions. We demonstrate
      through simulation models that a Turing-like mechanism can explain shark denticle
      patterning and verify this system using gene expression analysis and gene pathway
      inhibition experiments. This mechanism bears remarkable similarity to avian
      feather patterning, suggesting deep homology of the system. We propose that
      a diverse range of vertebrate appendages, from shark denticles to avian feathers

      "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during
      embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular
      mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that
      tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of
      chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously
      arising from specific chemical interactions (such as \u201cTuring-patterns\u201d).
      Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products
      of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories,
      and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively
      influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus
      on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development.
      On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical
      simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of
      the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical
      behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied
      using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis
      to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development.
      On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even
      simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead
      to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that
      the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories
      are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning
      theory.", "venue": "PLoS Comput. Biol.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 102,

      "What can artificial intelligence teach us about the mind? If AI''s underlying
      concept is that thinking is a computational process, then how can computation
      illuminate thinking? It''s a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the buzziest
      AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer systems that learn intelligent
      behavior from massive amounts of data. This is what powers a driverless car,
      for example. In this book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to \"good
      old fashioned artificial intelligence,\" which is based not on heaps of data
      but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind of artificial intelligence
      is equipped to handle situations that depart from previous patterns -- as we
      do in real life, when, for example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when
      the barista informs us there''s no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
      of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that passes the famous
      Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he proposes another way to test
      for intelligence -- the Winograd Schema Test, developed by Levesque and his
      colleagues. \"If our goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we had better
      understand the difference between making it and faking it,\" he observes. He
      identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the capacity to call
      on background knowledge: the ability to represent objects of thought symbolically.
      As AI migrates more and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems
      without common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.", "venue":

      model explains how identical cells can self-organize to form spatial patterns.
      It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different
      diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous
      signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical
      analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals
      that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern
      with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients.
      We provide a software (available at http://www.RDNets.com) to explore these
      networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental
      data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control
      embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how
      existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form
      Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework
      to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use
      of mathematical biology to engineer synthetic patterning systems. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14022.001",

      estimate species richness if there are many almost undetectable species in a
      hyper\u2010diverse community. Practically, an accurate lower bound for species
      richness is preferable to an inaccurate point estimator. The traditional nonparametric
      lower bound developed by Chao (1984, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11,
      265\u2013270) for individual\u2010based abundance data uses only the information
      on the rarest species (the numbers of singletons and doubletons) to estimate
      the number of undetected species in samples. Applying a modified Good\u2013Turing
      frequency formula, we derive an approximate formula for the first\u2010order
      bias of this traditional lower bound. The approximate bias is estimated by using
      additional information (namely, the numbers of tripletons and quadrupletons).
      This approximate bias can be corrected, and an improved lower bound is thus
      obtained. The proposed lower bound is nonparametric in the sense that it is
      universally valid for any species abundance distribution. A similar type of
      improved lower bound can be derived for incidence data. We test our proposed
      lower bounds on simulated data sets generated from various species abundance
      models. Simulation results show that the proposed lower bounds always reduce
      bias over the traditional lower bounds and improve accuracy (as measured by
      mean squared error) when the heterogeneity of species abundances is relatively
      high. We also apply the proposed new lower bounds to real data for illustration

      lives the dramatic quest for an undetectable imitation of a man, a woman, a

      way to new scientific paths with major consequences for contemporary live and

      the passage from classical AI to today''s neural nets, the relevance of non-linearity
      in biological dynamics, but also their abuses, such as the myth of a computational
      world, from a Turing-machine like universe to an encoded homunculus in the DNA.

      power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential
      computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been
      more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number
      of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing
      Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even greater number
      of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its
      memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM
      can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory is relatively
      easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire memory content
      at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement a fast NTM.
      In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to access the memory,
      while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the memory. We call this
      model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access a constant number of
      memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation can be faster.
      The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn programs of unbounded
      running time. We successfully trained the RL-NTM to solve a number of algorithmic
      tasks that are simpler than the ones solvable by the fully differentiable NTM.
      As the RL-NTM is a fairly intricate model, we needed a method for verifying
      the correctness of our implementation. To do so, we developed a simple technique
      for numerically checking arbitrary implementations of models that use Reinforce,

      accumulators that allows for a small commitment to a much larger storage. The
      commitment is unconditionally sound for a select piece of the storage. This
      primitive serves as an \"iO-friendly\" tool that allows us to make two different
      programs equivalent at different stages of a proof. The pieces of storage that
      are selected depend on what hybrid stage we are at in a proof. We first build
      up our enforcement ideas in a simpler context of \"message hiding encodings\"

      "abstract": "Significance Turing proposed that intercellular reaction-diffusion
      of molecules is responsible for morphogenesis. The impact of this paradigm has
      been profound. We exploit an abiological experimental system of emulsion drops
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reactants ideally suited to test Turing\u2019s
      theory. Our experiments verify Turing\u2019s thesis of the chemical basis of
      morphogenesis and reveal a pattern, not previously predicted by theory, which
      we explain by extending Turing\u2019s model to include heterogeneity. Quantitative
      experimental results obtained using this artificial cellular system establish
      the strengths and weaknesses of the Turing model, applicable to biology and
      materials science alike, and pinpoint which directions are required for improvement.
      Alan Turing, in \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d [Turing AM (1952)
      Philos Trans R Soc Lond 237(641):37\u201372], described how, in circular arrays
      of identical biological cells, diffusion can interact with chemical reactions
      to generate up to six periodic spatiotemporal chemical structures. Turing proposed
      that one of these structures, a stationary pattern with a chemically determined
      wavelength, is responsible for differentiation. We quantitatively test Turing\u2019s
      ideas in a cellular chemical system consisting of an emulsion of aqueous droplets
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillatory chemical reactants, dispersed
      in oil, and demonstrate that reaction-diffusion processes lead to chemical differentiation,
      which drives physical morphogenesis in chemical cells. We observe five of the
      six structures predicted by Turing. In 2D hexagonal arrays, a seventh structure
      emerges, incompatible with Turing\u2019s original model, which we explain by
      modifying the theory to include heterogeneity.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "title": "Globally stable microresonator Turing pattern formation for coherent
      high-power THz radiation on-chip", "abstract": "In nonlinear microresonators
      driven by continuous-wave (cw) lasers, Turing patterns have been studied in
      the formalism of Lugiato-Lefever equation with emphasis on its high coherence
      and exceptional robustness against perturbations. Destabilization of Turing
      pattern and transition to spatio-temporal chaos, however, limits the available
      energy carried in the Turing rolls and prevents further harvest of their high
      coherence and robustness to noise. Here we report a novel scheme to circumvent
      such destabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations,
      and attain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear
      oscillators, achieving a record high power conversion efficiency of 45% and
      an elevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern is
      discretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency
      sideband non-uniformity measured at 7.3x10^-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous
      microwave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution stages
      through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free running Turing roll
      coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is transferred onto a
      plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest power THz coherent generation at
      room-temperature, with 1.1% optical-to-THz power conversion. Its long-term stability
      can be further improved by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching an Allan
      deviation of 6x10^-10 at 100 s, with a simple computer-aided slow feedback control.
      The demonstrated on-chip coherent high-power Turing-THz system is promising
      to find applications in astrophysics, medical imaging, and wireless communications.",

      for identifying security weaknesses, by conducting friendly attacks. Simulated
      pentesting automates this process, through designing a model of the system at
      hand, and using model-based attack planning to generate the attacks. Classical
      planning variants of this idea are being used commercially by the pentesting
      industry since 2010. Such models can pinpoint potentially dangerous combinations
      of known vulnerabilities, but ignore the incomplete knowledge characteristic
      of hacking from the attacker''s point of view. Yet, ideally, the simulation
      should conduct its attacks the same way a real attacker would. Hence the ultimate
      goal is much more ambitious: to realistically simulate a human hacker. This
      is a grand vision indeed; e.g., the classical Turing Test can be viewed as a
      sub-problem. Taking a more practical perspective, the simulated pentesting model
      space spans a broad range of sequential decision making problems. Analyzing
      prior work in AI and other relevant areas, we derive a systematization of this
      model space, highlighting a multitude of interesting challenges to AI sequential

      "Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning
      tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,
      add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly
      in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,
      and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
      \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
      For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following
      two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well
      as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to
      a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the
      best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but
      as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all
      symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
      over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant
      of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
      from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
      1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
      at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
      and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "Neural

      on Turing (1952) \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019", "abstract":
      "Alan Turing was neither a biologist nor a chemist, and yet the paper he published
      in 1952, \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019, on the spontaneous
      formation of patterns in systems undergoing reaction and diffusion of their
      ingredients has had a substantial impact on both fields, as well as in other
      areas as disparate as geomorphology and criminology. Motivated by the question
      of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such as
      a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random
      fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial uniformity.
      The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far away from its
      equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial
      ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms, of which Turing''s
      model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason, these patterns show
      striking similarities in systems that seem superficially to share nothing in
      common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation on a zebra skin.
      New examples of \u2018Turing patterns'' in biology and beyond are still being

      owing to a periodic modulation of the resonator dispersion. We show that the
      bistable switching dynamics is dramatically affected by the competition between
      the two instability mechanisms, which dictates two completely novel scenarios.
      At low detunings from resonance, switching occurs between the stable stationary
      lower branch and the Faraday-unstable upper branch, whereas at high detunings
      we observe the crossover between the Turing and Faraday periodic structures.
      The results are well explained in terms of the universal Lugiato-Lefever model.",

      "title": "Towards a Visual Turing Challenge", "abstract": "As language and visual
      understanding by machines progresses rapidly, we are observing an increasing
      interest in holistic architectures that tightly interlink both modalities in
      a joint learning and inference process. This trend has allowed the community
      to progress towards more challenging and open tasks and refueled the hope at
      achieving the old AI dream of building machines that could pass a turing test
      in open domains. In order to steadily make progress towards this goal, we realize
      that quantifying performance becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore we ask
      how we can precisely define such challenges and how we can evaluate different
      algorithms on this open tasks? In this paper, we summarize and discuss such
      challenges as well as try to give answers where appropriate options are available
      in the literature. We exemplify some of the solutions on a recently presented
      dataset of question-answering task based on real-world indoor images that establishes
      a visual turing challenge. Finally, we argue despite the success of unique ground-truth
      annotation, we likely have to step away from carefully curated dataset and rather
      rely on ''social consensus'' as the main driving force to create suitable benchmarks.
      Providing coverage in this inherently ambiguous output space is an emerging
      challenge that we face in order to make quantifiable progress in this area.",

      "title": "Diverse set of Turing nanopatterns coat corneae across insect lineages",
      "abstract": "Significance Corneal surfaces of some insects are coated with nipple-like
      nanostructures reducing the light reflection. Here we provide an extensive analysis
      of corneae across insect groups. Using atomic force microscopy, we discover
      a striking diversity of corneal nanocoatings, omnipresent in arthropods. These
      fascinating bionanostructures replicate the complete set of the Turing patterns\u2014shapes
      resulting from the reaction\u2212diffusion modeling underlying many examples
      of patterning in biological and physicochemical systems. Our work, verging on
      the interface of nanotechnology and zoology, evolution and biophysics, and ecology
      and genetics, sheds light on the molecular origin and evolutionary diversification
      of a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures. It also describes,
      to our knowledge, the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.
      Nipple-like nanostructures covering the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies,
      and Drosophila have been studied by electron and atomic force microscopy, and
      their antireflective properties have been described. In contrast, corneal nanostructures
      of the majority of other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined
      by methods that did not allow precise morphological characterization. Here we
      provide a comprehensive analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing
      a rich diversity of insect corneal nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are categorized
      into four major morphological patterns and various transitions between them,
      many, to our knowledge, never described before. Remarkably, this unexpectedly
      diverse range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing
      patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled by
      Alan Turing in his famous reaction\u2212diffusion system. These findings reveal
      a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures and shed light on their
      molecular origin and evolutionary diversification. They may also be the first-ever

      have been focused on analyzing the effect of small delays on the pattern formation

      on the formation of Turing patterns of reaction-diffusion equations. First,
      for a delay system in a general form, we propose a technique calculating the
      critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs. Then
      we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern formation
      of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find that when
      the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular patterns,
      which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large delay we find
      spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find that the critical
      delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying capacity to half saturation
      of the prey density.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      "abstract": "We study the computational capabilities of a biologically inspired
      neural model where the synaptic weights, the connectivity pattern, and the number
      of neurons can evolve over time rather than stay static. Our study focuses on
      the mere concept of plasticity of the model so that the nature of the updates
      is assumed to be not constrained. In this context, we show that the so-called
      plastic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of the precise super-Turing
      computational power--as the static analog neural networks--irrespective of whether
      their synaptic weights are modeled by rational or real numbers, and moreover,
      irrespective of whether their patterns of plasticity are restricted to bi-valued
      updates or expressed by any other more general form of updating. Consequently,
      the incorporation of only bi-valued plastic capabilities in a basic model of
      RNNs suffices to break the Turing barrier and achieve the super-Turing level
      of computation. The consideration of more general mechanisms of architectural
      plasticity or of real synaptic weights does not further increase the capabilities
      of the networks. These results support the claim that the general mechanism
      of plasticity is crucially involved in the computational and dynamical capabilities
      of biological neural networks. They further show that the super-Turing level

      "title": "Alan Turing : His Work and Impact", "abstract": "Some may wonder whether
      the level of praise that has been lavished on Turing is justified. Yes, the
      1936 paper in which he defined what are now known as Turing machines is a landmark
      in the history of science, but other logicians at the time were involved in
      the development of formal models of computation, including Herbrand, G\u00f6del,
      Post, and Church. And, although Turing played an important part in the development
      of the modern electronic computer, his role should not be overstated: a number
      of early computing devices were built from the late 1930\u2019s to mid-1940\u2019s
      with little or no influence of Turing\u2019s early foundational work, and the
      real history involves a complex mix of theoretical and practical insights, with
      contributions from a substantial cast of researchers and engineers alongside
      Turing. Finally, although the hideous abuses that Turing was subjected to as
      a homosexual in postwar Britain are made even more ironic by the role he played
      in helping the allies win the war, those abuses are no more morally offensive
      than those suffered by countless others whose lives are left uncelebrated. With
      all this in mind, it is reasonable to ask: was all the hoopla really called
      for? One need only sit down with Turing\u2019s work for an hour or two, however,
      to find such doubts pushed aside. His papers are full of technical detail, but
      are surprisingly easy to read. His writing is careful and methodical, but even
      after all these years the work feels creatively fresh and original. He dealt
      with weighty topics and raised important questions, but relied on technical
      mastery and a good deal of hard work to back up his answers. When we read",

      Game - Updated Edition", "abstract": "Alan Turing died in 1954, but the themes
      of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from
      a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations
      for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges: Alan had proved that there
      was no \"miraculous machine\" that could solve all mathematical problems, but
      in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea
      of a universal machine that could take over the work of any machine. During
      World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret
      British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German''s Enigma machine code
      was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because
      his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security,
      implemented with machines and remorseless logic: \"It was his own invention,
      and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.\" Andrew Hodges''s remarkable
      insight weaves Turing''s mathematical and computer work with his personal life
      to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek

      the intellectual significance of Turing''s work, while never losing sight of
      the human and social picture: In this sense his life belied his work, for it
      could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life
      raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the
      body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society,

      "abstract": "It is hard to bridge the gap between mathematical formulations
      and biological implementations of Turing patterns, yet this is necessary for
      both understanding and engineering these networks with synthetic biology approaches.
      Here, we model a reaction\u2013diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable
      regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology
      study in mammalian cells.1 The model employs a single promoter to express both
      the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large regions
      of parameter space, using biologically interpretable Hill function reactions.
      We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing biologically
      tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of successful patterning.
      We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time evolution by manipulating
      the values for production and degradation relationships. More importantly, our
      analysis predicts that steep dose\u2013response functions arising from cooperativity
      are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness increases parameter space
      and even reduces the requirement for differential diffusion between activator
      and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some of the limitations of linear scenarios
      for reaction\u2013diffusion systems and will help to guide projects to engineer

      "During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing 1912--1954 has been widely
      celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption,
      Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate Turing''s
      motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as
      expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments
      within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In
      particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also
      the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level
      AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine a machine
      which learns like an infant dominates the closing section of the paper, in which
      he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three
      alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: 1 AI by programming,
      2 AI by ab initio machine learning and 3 AI using logic, probabilities, learning
      and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in
      the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We
      compare Turing''s three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude
      with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper.",

      system to describe species anomalous superdiffusion. The effects of the superdiffusive
      exponent on pattern formation and pattern selection are studied. Our linear
      stability analysis shows that the wave number of the Turing pattern increases
      with the superdiffusive exponent. A weakly nonlinear analysis yields a system
      of amplitude equations and the analysis of these amplitude equations predicts
      parameter regimes where hexagons, stripes, and their coexistence are expected.
      Numerical simulations of the activator-inhibitor model near the stability boundaries
      confirm our analytical results. Since diffusion rate manifests in both diffusion
      constant and diffusion exponent, we numerically explore their interactions on
      the emergence of Turing patterns. When the activator and inhibitor have different
      superdiffusive exponents, we find that the critical ratio of the diffusion rate
      of the inhibitor to the activator, required for the formation of the Turing
      pattern, increases monotonically with the superdiffusive exponent. We conclude
      that small ratio (than unity) of anomalous diffusion exponent between the inhibitor

      Science\u2019", "abstract": "In the popular imagination, the relevance of Turing''s
      theoretical ideas to people producing actual machines was significant and appreciated
      by everybody involved in computing from the moment he published his 1936 paper
      \u2018On Computable Numbers\u2019. Careful historians are aware that this popular
      conception is deeply misleading. We know from previous work by Campbell-Kelly,
      Aspray, Akera, Olley, Priestley, Daylight, Mounier-Kuhn, Haigh, and others that
      several computing pioneers, including Aiken, Eckert, Mauchly, and Zuse, did
      not depend on (let alone were they aware of) Turing''s 1936 universal-machine
      concept. Furthermore, it is not clear whether any substance in von Neumann''s
      celebrated 1945 \u2018First Draft Report on the EDVAC\u2019 is influenced in
      any identifiable way by Turing''s work. This raises the questions: (i) When
      does Turing enter the field? (ii) Why did the Association for Computing Machinery
      (ACM) honor Turing by associating his name to ACM''s most prestigious award,
      the Turing Award? Previous authors have been rather vague about these questions,
      suggesting some date between 1950 and the early 1960s as the point at which
      Turing is retroactively integrated into the foundations of computing and associating
      him in some way with the movement to develop something that people call computer
      science. In this paper, based on detailed examination of hitherto overlooked
      primary sources, attempts are made to reconstruct networks of scholars and ideas
      prevalent in the 1950s, and to identify a specific group of actors interested
      in theorizing about computations in computers and attracted to the idea of language
      as a frame in which to understand computation. By going back to Turing''s 1936
      paper and, more importantly, to re-cast versions of Turing''s work published
      during the 1950s (Rosenbloom, Kleene, Markov), I identify the factors that made
      this group of scholars particularly interested in Turing''s work and provided
      the original vector by which Turing became to be appreciated in retrospect as
      the father of computer science.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

      presents some important issues on misidentification of human interlocutors in
      text-based communication during practical Turing tests. The study here presents
      transcripts in which human judges succumbed to theconfederate effect, misidentifying
      hidden human foils for machines. An attempt is made to assess the reasons for
      this. The practical Turing tests in question were held on 23 June 2012 at Bletchley
      Park, England. A selection of actual full transcripts from the tests is shown
      and an analysis is given in each case. As a result of these tests, conclusions
      are drawn with regard to the sort of strategies which can perhaps lead to erroneous
      conclusions when one is involved as an interrogator. Such results also serve
      to indicate conversational directions to avoid for those machine designers who
      wish to create a conversational entity that performs well on the Turing test.",

      of a Turing-Type Mechanism", "abstract": "Digit Determination Pentadactyly has
      been an early and rapid innovation of tetrapods. Sheth et al. (p. 1476) report
      that a dramatic reduction in distally expressed Hox genes, in the absence of
      a functional morphogen signaling pathway, results in extreme polydactyly in
      mice. Mutant digits exhibited patterns reminiscent of the endoskeleton of fins,
      suggesting that an ancestral patterning mechanism has been deeply conserved
      in evolution. Mouse genetics and computer modeling suggest that a reaction-diffusion
      mechanism defines digit pattern. The formation of repetitive structures (such
      as stripes) in nature is often consistent with a reaction-diffusion mechanism,
      or Turing model, of self-organizing systems. We used mouse genetics to analyze
      how digit patterning (an iterative digit/nondigit pattern) is generated. We
      showed that the progressive reduction in Hoxa13 and Hoxd11-Hoxd13 genes (hereafter
      referred to as distal Hox genes) from the Gli3-null background results in progressively
      more severe polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely packed digits. Combined
      with computer modeling, our results argue for a Turing-type mechanism underlying
      digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes modulates the digit
      period or wavelength. The phenotypic similarity with fish-fin endoskeleton patterns
      suggests that the pentadactyl state has been achieved through modification of
      an ancestral Turing-type mechanism.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

      "Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy, homogenous
      initial conditions and have been proposed as patterning mechanism for many developmental
      processes. However, the molecular components that give rise to Turing patterns
      have remained elusive, and the small size of the parameter space that permits
      Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to explain how Turing patterns
      could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing patterns can be obtained with
      a single ligand if the ligand-receptor interaction is taken into account. Here
      we show that the general properties of ligand-receptor systems result in very
      large Turing spaces. Thus, the restriction of receptors to single cells, negative
      feedbacks, regulatory interactions among different ligand-receptor systems,
      and the clustering of receptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the
      Turing space. We further show that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10-SHH
      network that controls lung branching morphogenesis are sufficient to result
      in large Turing spaces. We conclude that the cellular restriction of receptors
      provides a mechanism to sufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to
      make the evolution of Turing patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then
      have further enlarged the Turing space. Given their robustness and flexibility,
      we propose that receptor-ligand-based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism
      for patterning in biology.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      nonlinear diffusion on pattern formation in the Brusselator system. Through
      linear stability analysis of the basic solution we determine the Turing and
      the oscillatory instability boundaries. A comparison with the classical linear
      diffusion shows how nonlinear diffusion favors the occurrence of Turing pattern
      formation. We study the process of pattern formation both in one-dimensional
      and two-dimensional spatial domains. Through a weakly nonlinear multiple scales
      analysis we derive the equations for the amplitude of the stationary patterns.
      The analysis of the amplitude equations shows the occurrence of a number of
      different phenomena, including stable supercritical and subcritical Turing patterns
      with multiple branches of stable solutions leading to hysteresis. Moreover,
      we consider traveling patterning waves: When the domain size is large, the pattern
      forms sequentially and traveling wave fronts are the precursors to patterning.
      We derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation and describe the traveling front enveloping
      a pattern which invades the domain. We show the emergence of radially symmetric
      target patterns, and, through a matching procedure, we construct the outer amplitude

      Turing mechanism", "abstract": "The main signalling proteins that control early
      kidney branching have been defined. Yet the underlying mechanism is still elusive.
      We have previously shown that a Schnakenberg-type Turing mechanism can recapitulate
      the branching and protein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant lungs,
      but it is unclear whether this mechanism would extend to other branched organs
      that are regulated by other proteins. Here, we show that the glial cell line-derived
      neurotrophic factor\u2013RET regulatory interaction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type
      Turing model that reproduces the observed budding of the ureteric bud from the
      Wolffian duct, its invasion into the mesenchyme and the observed branching pattern.
      The model also recapitulates all relevant protein expression patterns in wild-type
      and mutant mice. The lung and kidney models are both based on a particular receptor\u2013ligand
      interaction and require (1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2)
      a lower diffusion coefficient for the receptor than for the ligand and (3) an
      increase in the receptor concentration in response to receptor\u2013ligand binding
      (by enhanced transcription, more recycling or similar). These conditions are
      met also by other receptor\u2013ligand systems. We propose that ligand\u2013receptor-based

      "title": "The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine", "abstract": "In honor of
      Alan Turing''s hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about one
      of Turing''s obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and free
      will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call \"Knightian freedom\":
      a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic
      unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as
      possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently
      by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries to find scope
      for \"freedom\" in the universe''s boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical
      laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems.
      I investigate how far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the
      way, encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement
      problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb''s
      paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior
      Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations
      of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time,
      quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which
      has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting
      empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old
      philosophical debate into some underexplored territory.", "venue": "The Once
