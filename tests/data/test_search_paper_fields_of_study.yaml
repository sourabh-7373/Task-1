      quantum computer", "abstract": "It is argued that underlying the Church\u2013Turing
      hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is
      presented explicitly as a physical principle: \u2018every finitely realizible
      physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine
      operating by finite means\u2019. Classical physics and the universal Turing
      machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey
      the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing
      machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines
      is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ''universal quantum
      computer\u2019 are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling
      the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have
      many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do
      not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include
      \u2018quantum parallelism\u2019, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks
      can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
      restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable
      strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett\u2019s. Some
      of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the
      rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically
      more reasonable definition of the \u2018complexity\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019
      in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.", "venue": "Proceedings

      "title": "Statistically Meaningful Approximation: a Case Study on Approximating
      Turing Machines with Transformers", "abstract": "A common lens to theoretically
      study neural net architectures is to analyze the functions they can approximate.
      However, constructions from approximation theory may be unrealistic and therefore
      less meaningful. For example, a common unrealistic trick is to encode target
      function values using infinite precision. To address these issues, this work
      proposes a formal definition of statistically meaningful (SM) approximation
      which requires the approximating network to exhibit good statistical learnability.
      We study SM approximation for two function classes: boolean circuits and Turing
      machines. We show that overparameterized feedforward neural nets can SM approximate
      boolean circuits with sample complexity depending only polynomially on the circuit
      size, not the size of the network. In addition, we show that transformers can
      SM approximate Turing machines with computation time bounded by $T$ with sample
      complexity polynomial in the alphabet size, state space size, and $\\log (T)$.
      We also introduce new tools for analyzing generalization which provide much
      tighter sample complexities than the typical VC-dimension or norm-based bounds,
      which may be of independent interest.", "venue": "Neural Information Processing

      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      of the primary instability mechanisms useful for studying the transition from
      homogeneous states to heterogeneous spatial or spatio-temporal states in reaction\u2013diffusion

      is non-autonomous or has a base state which varies in time, as in this case
      standard approaches, which rely on temporal eigenvalues, break down. We are
      able to establish respective criteria for the onset of each instability using

      the Turing and Benjamin\u2013Feir analysis amenable for a wide collection of

      is considered, in which it is of interest for the receiver to decide only whether
      a certain message has been sent or not, and the identification-feedback (IDF)
      capacity of channels with feedback is studied. The IDF capacity is shown to
      be discontinuous and super-additive for both deterministic and randomized encoding.
      For the deterministic IDF capacity the phenomenon of super-activation occurs,
      which is the strongest form of super-additivity. This is the first time that
      super-activation is observed for discrete memoryless channels. On the other
      hand, for the randomized IDF capacity, super-activation is not possible. Finally,
      the developed theory is studied from an algorithmic point of view by using the
      framework of Turing computability. The problem of computing the IDF capacity
      on a Turing machine is connected to problems in pure mathematics and it is shown
      that if the IDF capacity would be Turing computable, it would provide solutions
      to other problems in mathematics including Goldbach\u2019s conjecture and the
      Riemann Hypothesis. However, it is shown that the deterministic and randomized
      IDF capacities are not Banach-Mazur computable. This is the weakest form of
      computability implying that the IDF capacity is not computable even for universal
      Turing machines. On the other hand, the identification capacity without feedback
      is Turing computable revealing the impact of the feedback: It transforms the

      stable spatially homogeneous/inhomogeneous periodic solutions and steady states,

      "title": "Turing patterns mediated by network topology in homogeneous active
      systems.", "abstract": "Mechanisms of pattern formation-of which the Turing
      instability is an archetype-constitute an important class of dynamical processes
      occurring in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. Recently, it has
      been shown that the Turing instability can induce pattern formation in discrete
      media such as complex networks, opening up the intriguing possibility of exploring
      it as a generative mechanism in a plethora of socioeconomic contexts. Yet much
      remains to be understood in terms of the precise connection between network
      topology and its role in inducing the patterns. Here we present a general mathematical
      description of a two-species reaction-diffusion process occurring on different
      flavors of network topology. The dynamical equations are of the predator-prey
      class that, while traditionally used to model species population, has also been
      used to model competition between antagonistic features in social contexts.
      We demonstrate that the Turing instability can be induced in any network topology
      by tuning the diffusion of the competing species or by altering network connectivity.
      The extent to which the emergent patterns reflect topological properties is
      determined by a complex interplay between the diffusion coefficients and the
      localization properties of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We find
      that networks with large degree fluctuations tend to have stable patterns over
      the space of initial perturbations, whereas patterns in more homogenous networks
      are purely stochastic.", "venue": "Physical Review E", "year": 2019, "referenceCount":

      yields the occurrence of spatial patterns. Furthermore, some numerical simulations

      Essential properties of a Turing system, such as the conditions for the existence

      fundamental system properties and constraints has not be found. Here we provide
      a first general theory of Turing network topology, which proves why three key

      patterning with equally diffusing signals", "abstract": "The Turing reaction-diffusion
      model explains how identical cells can self-organize to form spatial patterns.
      It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different
      diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous
      signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical
      analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals
      that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern
      with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients.
      We provide a software (available at http://www.RDNets.com) to explore these
      networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental
      data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control
      embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how
      existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form
      Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework
      to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use
      of mathematical biology to engineer synthetic patterning systems. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14022.001",

      good\u2013turing frequency formula", "abstract": "It is difficult to accurately
      estimate species richness if there are many almost undetectable species in a
      hyper\u2010diverse community. Practically, an accurate lower bound for species
      richness is preferable to an inaccurate point estimator. The traditional nonparametric
      lower bound developed by Chao (1984, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11,
      265\u2013270) for individual\u2010based abundance data uses only the information
      on the rarest species (the numbers of singletons and doubletons) to estimate
      the number of undetected species in samples. Applying a modified Good\u2013Turing
      frequency formula, we derive an approximate formula for the first\u2010order
      bias of this traditional lower bound. The approximate bias is estimated by using
      additional information (namely, the numbers of tripletons and quadrupletons).
      This approximate bias can be corrected, and an improved lower bound is thus
      obtained. The proposed lower bound is nonparametric in the sense that it is
      universally valid for any species abundance distribution. A similar type of
      improved lower bound can be derived for incidence data. We test our proposed
      lower bounds on simulated data sets generated from various species abundance
      models. Simulation results show that the proposed lower bounds always reduce
      bias over the traditional lower bounds and improve accuracy (as measured by
      mean squared error) when the heterogeneity of species abundances is relatively
      high. We also apply the proposed new lower bounds to real data for illustration
      and for comparisons with previously developed estimators.", "venue": "Biometrics",

      "abstract": "Yao''s 1995 publication \u2018Quantum circuit complexity\u2019
      in Proceedings of the 34th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer
      Science, pp. 352\u2013361, proved that quantum Turing machines and quantum circuits
      are polynomially equivalent computational models: t\u2265n steps of a quantum
      Turing machine running on an input of length n can be simulated by a uniformly
      generated family of quantum circuits with size quadratic in t, and a polynomial-time
      uniformly generated family of quantum circuits can be simulated by a quantum
      Turing machine running in polynomial time. We revisit the simulation of quantum
      Turing machines with uniformly generated quantum circuits, which is the more
      challenging of the two simulation tasks, and present a variation on the simulation
      method employed by Yao together with an analysis of it. This analysis reveals
      that the simulation of quantum Turing machines can be performed by quantum circuits
      having depth linear in t, rather than quadratic depth, and can be extended to
      variants of quantum Turing machines, such as ones having multi-dimensional tapes.
      Our analysis is based on an extension of method described by Arright, Nesme
      and Werner in 2011 in Journal of Computer and System Sciences 77, 372\u2013378.

      driven instability has been hypothesized as a mechanism to drive spatial self-organization
      in biological systems since the seminal work of Turing. Such systems are often
      considered on a growing domain, but traditional theoretical studies have only
      treated the domain size as a bifurcation parameter, neglecting the system non-autonomy.
      More recently, the conditions for a diffusively driven instability on a growing
      domain have been determined under stringent conditions, including slow growth,
      a restriction on the temporal interval over which the prospect of an instability
      can be considered and a neglect of the impact that time evolution has on the
      stability properties of the homogeneous reference state from which heterogeneity
      emerges. Here, we firstly relax this latter assumption and observe that the
      conditions for the Turing instability are much more complex and depend on the
      history of the system in general. We proceed to relax all the above constraints,
      making analytical progress by focusing on specific examples. With faster growth,
      instabilities can grow transiently and decay, making the prediction of a prospective
      Turing instability much more difficult. In addition, arbitrarily high spatial
      frequencies can destabilize, in which case the continuum approximation is predicted
      to break down.", "venue": "Proceedings of the Royal Society A", "year": 2017,

      "title": "Turing mechanism underlying a branching model for lung morphogenesis",
      "abstract": "The mammalian lung develops through branching morphogenesis. Two
      primary forms of branching, which occur in order, in the lung have been identified:
      tip bifurcation and side branching. However, the mechanisms of lung branching
      morphogenesis remain to be explored. In our previous study, a biological mechanism
      was presented for lung branching pattern formation through a branching model.
      Here, we provide a mathematical mechanism underlying the branching patterns.
      By decoupling the branching model, we demonstrated the existence of Turing instability.
      We performed Turing instability analysis to reveal the mathematical mechanism
      of the branching patterns. Our simulation results show that the Turing patterns
      underlying the branching patterns are spot patterns that exhibit high local
      morphogen concentration. The high local morphogen concentration induces the
      growth of branching. Furthermore, we found that the sparse spot patterns underlie
      the tip bifurcation patterns, while the dense spot patterns underlies the side
      branching patterns. The dispersion relation analysis shows that the Turing wavelength
      affects the branching structure. As the wavelength decreases, the spot patterns
      change from sparse to dense, the rate of tip bifurcation decreases and side
      branching eventually occurs instead. In the process of transformation, there
      may exists hybrid branching that mixes tip bifurcation and side branching. Since
      experimental studies have reported that branching mode switching from side branching
      to tip bifurcation in the lung is under genetic control, our simulation results
      suggest that genes control the switch of the branching mode by regulating the
      Turing wavelength. Our results provide a novel insight into and understanding
      of the formation of branching patterns in the lung and other biological systems.",

      "title": "Competitive Distribution Estimation: Why is Good-Turing Good", "abstract":
      "Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning
      tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,
      add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly
      in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,
      and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
      \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
      For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following
      two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well
      as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to
      a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the
      best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but
      as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all
      symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
      over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant
      of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
      from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
      1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
      at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
      and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "Neural

      and can significantly change the dynamics of these systems. Quite a few works
      have been focused on analyzing the effect of small delays on the pattern formation
      of biological systems. In this paper, we investigate the effect of any delay
      on the formation of Turing patterns of reaction-diffusion equations. First,
      for a delay system in a general form, we propose a technique calculating the
      critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs. Then
      we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern formation
      of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find that when
      the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular patterns,
      which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large delay we find
      spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find that the critical
      delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying capacity to half saturation
      of the prey density.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      the level of praise that has been lavished on Turing is justified. Yes, the
      1936 paper in which he defined what are now known as Turing machines is a landmark
      in the history of science, but other logicians at the time were involved in
      the development of formal models of computation, including Herbrand, G\u00f6del,
      Post, and Church. And, although Turing played an important part in the development
      of the modern electronic computer, his role should not be overstated: a number
      of early computing devices were built from the late 1930\u2019s to mid-1940\u2019s
      with little or no influence of Turing\u2019s early foundational work, and the
      real history involves a complex mix of theoretical and practical insights, with
      contributions from a substantial cast of researchers and engineers alongside
      Turing. Finally, although the hideous abuses that Turing was subjected to as
      a homosexual in postwar Britain are made even more ironic by the role he played
      in helping the allies win the war, those abuses are no more morally offensive
      than those suffered by countless others whose lives are left uncelebrated. With
      all this in mind, it is reasonable to ask: was all the hoopla really called
      for? One need only sit down with Turing\u2019s work for an hour or two, however,
      to find such doubts pushed aside. His papers are full of technical detail, but
      are surprisingly easy to read. His writing is careful and methodical, but even
      after all these years the work feels creatively fresh and original. He dealt
      with weighty topics and raised important questions, but relied on technical
      mastery and a good deal of hard work to back up his answers. When we read",

      of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation for the local kinetics is proved. In the
      spatial case, initiation of morphological patterns induced by diffusion is shown
      to occur in a suitable region of the parameter space. The intriguing interplay
      between Hopf and Turing instability is also considered, by investigating the
      spatio-temporal behaviour of the system in the neighbourhood of the codimension-two
      Turing--Hopf bifurcation point. An ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) scheme
      based on high-order finite differences in space is applied to obtain numerical
      approximations of Turing patterns at the steady state and for the simulation

      system to describe species anomalous superdiffusion. The effects of the superdiffusive
      exponent on pattern formation and pattern selection are studied. Our linear
      stability analysis shows that the wave number of the Turing pattern increases
      with the superdiffusive exponent. A weakly nonlinear analysis yields a system
      of amplitude equations and the analysis of these amplitude equations predicts
      parameter regimes where hexagons, stripes, and their coexistence are expected.
      Numerical simulations of the activator-inhibitor model near the stability boundaries
      confirm our analytical results. Since diffusion rate manifests in both diffusion
      constant and diffusion exponent, we numerically explore their interactions on
      the emergence of Turing patterns. When the activator and inhibitor have different
      superdiffusive exponents, we find that the critical ratio of the diffusion rate
      of the inhibitor to the activator, required for the formation of the Turing
      pattern, increases monotonically with the superdiffusive exponent. We conclude
      that small ratio (than unity) of anomalous diffusion exponent between the inhibitor
      and activator is more likely to promote the emergence of the Turing pattern,
      relative to the normal diffusion.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical,

      are logically reversible and have a well-defined and consistent thermodynamic

      process on an enormously large state space, allows us to thoroughly investigate
      the thermodynamics of computation for this situation. Especially in the stationary
      regime we can well approximate the master equation by a simple Fokker-Planck
      equation in one dimension. We then show that the entropy production rate at
      steady state can be made arbitrarily small, but the total (integrated) entropy
      production is finite and grows logarithmically with the number of computational

      instability is a paradigmatic route to pattern formation in reaction-diffusion
      systems. Following a diffusion-driven instability, homogeneous fixed points
      can become unstable when subject to external perturbation. As a consequence,
      the system evolves towards a stationary, nonhomogeneous attractor. Stable patterns
      can be also obtained via oscillation quenching of an initially synchronous state
      of diffusively coupled oscillators. In the literature this is known as the oscillation
      death phenomenon. Here, we show that oscillation death is nothing but a Turing

      state. In particular, we obtain a set of approximated closed conditions for
      identifying the domain in the parameter space that yields the instability. This
      is a natural generalization of the original Turing relations, to the case where
      the homogeneous solution of the examined system is a periodic function of time.

      "Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy, homogenous
      initial conditions and have been proposed as patterning mechanism for many developmental
      processes. However, the molecular components that give rise to Turing patterns
      have remained elusive, and the small size of the parameter space that permits
      Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to explain how Turing patterns
      could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing patterns can be obtained with
      a single ligand if the ligand-receptor interaction is taken into account. Here
      we show that the general properties of ligand-receptor systems result in very
      large Turing spaces. Thus, the restriction of receptors to single cells, negative
      feedbacks, regulatory interactions among different ligand-receptor systems,
      and the clustering of receptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the
      Turing space. We further show that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10-SHH
      network that controls lung branching morphogenesis are sufficient to result
      in large Turing spaces. We conclude that the cellular restriction of receptors
      provides a mechanism to sufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to
      make the evolution of Turing patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then
      have further enlarged the Turing space. Given their robustness and flexibility,
      we propose that receptor-ligand-based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism
      for patterning in biology.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      nonlinear diffusion on pattern formation in the Brusselator system. Through
      linear stability analysis of the basic solution we determine the Turing and
      the oscillatory instability boundaries. A comparison with the classical linear
      diffusion shows how nonlinear diffusion favors the occurrence of Turing pattern
      formation. We study the process of pattern formation both in one-dimensional
      and two-dimensional spatial domains. Through a weakly nonlinear multiple scales
      analysis we derive the equations for the amplitude of the stationary patterns.
      The analysis of the amplitude equations shows the occurrence of a number of
      different phenomena, including stable supercritical and subcritical Turing patterns
      with multiple branches of stable solutions leading to hysteresis. Moreover,
      we consider traveling patterning waves: When the domain size is large, the pattern
      forms sequentially and traveling wave fronts are the precursors to patterning.
      We derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation and describe the traveling front enveloping
      a pattern which invades the domain. We show the emergence of radially symmetric
      target patterns, and, through a matching procedure, we construct the outer amplitude

      "title": "The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine", "abstract": "In honor of
      Alan Turing''s hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about one
      of Turing''s obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and free
      will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call \"Knightian freedom\":
      a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic
      unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as
      possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently
      by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries to find scope
      for \"freedom\" in the universe''s boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical
      laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems.
      I investigate how far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the
      way, encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement
      problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb''s
      paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior
      Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations
      of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time,
      quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which
      has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting
      empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old
      philosophical debate into some underexplored territory.", "venue": "The Once

      polarity switching of stochastic patterns occurs at a defined frequency. We
      find that it can do so in individual realizations of a stochastic simulation,
