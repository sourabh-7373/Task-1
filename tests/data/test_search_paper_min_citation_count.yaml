      quantum computer", "abstract": "It is argued that underlying the Church\u2013Turing
      hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is
      presented explicitly as a physical principle: \u2018every finitely realizible
      physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine
      operating by finite means\u2019. Classical physics and the universal Turing
      machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey
      the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing
      machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines
      is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ''universal quantum
      computer\u2019 are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling
      the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have
      many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do
      not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include
      \u2018quantum parallelism\u2019, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks
      can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
      restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable
      strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett\u2019s. Some
      of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the
      rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically
      more reasonable definition of the \u2018complexity\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019
      in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.", "venue": "Proceedings

      "title": "The chemical basis of morphogenesis", "abstract": "It is suggested
      that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and
      diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of
      morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous,
      may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous
      equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion
      systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells,
      a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation
      is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are
      six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting
      form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account,
      for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves. A system
      of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears
      to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives
      rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary
      waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis.The purpose
      of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote
      may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory
      does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known
      physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding
      of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some
      elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all
      of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be
      found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.",

      by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot

      models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models
      for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency
      (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention
      mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism
      that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a
      universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby
      preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the
      way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$
      global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the
      sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences
      of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As
      a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically
      improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.

      "abstract": "Handwritten characters drawn by a model Not only do children learn
      effortlessly, they do so quickly and with a remarkable ability to use what they
      have learned as the raw material for creating new stuff. Lake et al. describe
      a computational model that learns in a similar fashion and does so better than
      current deep learning algorithms. The model classifies, parses, and recreates
      handwritten characters, and can generate new letters of the alphabet that look
      \u201cright\u201d as judged by Turing-like tests of the model''s output in comparison
      to what real humans produce. Science, this issue p. 1332 Combining the capacity
      to handle noise with probabilistic learning yields humanlike performance in
      a computational model. People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully
      from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require
      tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also
      use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms\u2014for action,
      imagination, and explanation. We present a computational model that captures
      these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts:
      handwritten characters from the world\u2019s alphabets. The model represents
      concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian
      criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves
      human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches.
      We also present several \u201cvisual Turing tests\u201d probing the model\u2019s

      to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that
      are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems
      cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence
      [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in
      each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable.
      Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial
      optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of
      variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural
      attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead
      of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at
      each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the
      input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net).
      We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging
      geometric problems - finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations,
      and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem - using training examples alone.
      Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but
      also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that
      the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on.
      We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural
      learning for discrete problems.", "venue": "Neural Information Processing Systems",

      2007 ACM A.M. Turing Award. In 1981, Edmund M. Clarke and E. Allen Emerson,
      working in the USA, and Joseph Sifakis working independently in France, authored
      seminal papers that founded what has become the highly successful field of model
      checking. This verification technology provides an algorithmic means of determining
      whether an abstract model---representing, for example, a hardware or software
      design---satisfies a formal specification expressed as a temporal logic (TL)
      formula. Moreover, if the property does not hold, the method identifies a counterexample
      execution that shows the source of the problem. The progression of model checking
      to the point where it can be successfully used for complex systems has required
      the development of sophisticated means of coping with what is known as the state
      explosion problem. Great strides have been made on this problem over the past
      28 years by what is now a very large international research community. As a
      result many major hardware and software companies are beginning to use model
      checking in practice. Examples of its use include the verification of VLSI circuits,
      communication protocols, software device drivers, real-time embedded systems,
      and security algorithms. The work of Clarke, Emerson, and Sifakis continues
      to be central to the success of this research area. Their work over the years
      has led to the creation of new logics for specification, new verification algorithms,
      and surprising theoretical results. Model checking tools, created by both academic
      and industrial teams, have resulted in an entirely novel approach to verification
      and test case generation. This approach, for example, often enables engineers
      in the electronics industry to design complex systems with considerable assurance
      regarding the correctness of their initial designs. Model checking promises
      to have an even greater impact on the hardware and software industries in the
      future. ---Moshe Y. Vardi, Editor-in-Chief", "venue": "Communications of the

      "title": "Linear logic", "abstract": "1 Linear Logic Linear logic was introduced
      by Girard in 1987 11]. Since then many results have supported Girard''s claims
      such as \\Linear logic is a resource conscious logic\". Increasingly, computer
      scientists have recognized linear logic as an expressive and powerful logic,
      with deep connections to concepts from computer science. The expressive power
      of linear logic is evidenced by some very natural encodings of computational
      models such as Petri nets, counter machines, Turing machines, and others. This
      note presents an intuitive overview of linear logic, some recent theoretical
      results, and some interesting applications of linear logic to computer science.
      Other introductions to linear logic may be found in 12, 36]. 2 Linear Logic
      vs Classical and Intuitionistic Logics Linear logic diiers from classical and
      intuitionistic logic in several fundamental ways. Classical logic may be viewed
      as if it deals with static propositions about the world where each proposition
      is either true or false. Because of the static nature of propositions in classical
      logic, one may \\duplicate\" propositions: P implies (P and P). Implicitly we
      learn that \\one P is as good as two\". Also, one may discard propositions:
      (P and Q) implies P. Here the proposition Q has been \\thrown away\". Both of
      these sentences are valid in classical logic for any P and Q. In linear logic,
      these sentences are not valid. A linear logician might ask \\Where did the second
      P come from?\" and \\Where did the Q go?\". Of course these questions are nonse-quiturs
      in the classical setting, since propositions are assumed to be static, unchanging
      facts about the world. On the other hand, the rules of linear logic imply that
      linear propositions stand for dynamic properties or nite resources.", "venue":

      "title": "Real-Time Computing Without Stable States: A New Framework for Neural
      Computation Based on Perturbations", "abstract": "A key challenge for neural
      modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly
      changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of
      integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model
      for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to
      paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not
      require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based
      on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical
      learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent
      circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional
      dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit
      may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract
      in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information
      about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal
      states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal
      states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due
      to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on
      a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing
      machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete
      internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical
      results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions,
      but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of
      time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation
      of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology,

      computing automaton (e.g.. a Turing machine) is logically irreversible- its
      transition function lacks a single-valued inverse. Here it is shown that such
      machines may he made logically reversible at every step, while retainillg their
      simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great
      physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically
      reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed
      while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the
      first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels
      the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate
      results, there by avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second
      stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly
      disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of
      the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because
      the first stage has been carried out reversibly), there by restoring the machine
      (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final
      machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy
      of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated
      explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger
      RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation.", "venue":

      "Despite recent breakthroughs in the applications of deep neural networks, one
      setting that presents a persistent challenge is that of \"one-shot learning.\"
      Traditional gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn, often through
      extensive iterative training. When new data is encountered, the models must
      inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information
      without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities,
      such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and
      retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of
      conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented
      neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make
      accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also introduce a new method
      for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content, unlike previous
      methods that additionally use memory location-based focusing mechanisms.", "venue":

      simulations of artificial ecologies typically model the interactions of a population
      of independently acting, spatially situated, resource-restricted, differently
      structured, self-reproducing agents. The interactions in such systems are typically
      highly nonlinear, subject to random perturbation, executed in parallel, and
      coevolutionary in the sense that the agents interact with each other as well
      as their environment. Examples of artificial ecologies that possess the above
      characteristics include Skipper''s \"computer zoo\" of migrating flocks of hierarchically
      invokable fragments of assembly code [10], Shanahan''s populations of evolutionary
      automata [9], Lindgren''s coevolving populations of strategies for playing the
      iterated prisoner''s dilemma game [5], the Turing gas of self-organizing groups
      of autocatalytic algorithmic fragments of Rasmussen, KnudLsen, and Feldberg

      of the details. Moreover, all of these existing systems are computationally
      expensive and deliver little in the way of important emergent phenomena in relation
      to the amount of computational effort expended. This excessive overhead is not
      merely a matter of inefficiency or inconvenience; it may actually preclude emergence

      "Software protection is one of the most important issues concerning computer
      practice. There exist many heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but
      the problem as a whole has not received the theoretical treatment it deserves.
      In this paper, we provide theoretical treatment of software protection. We reduce
      the problem of software protection to the problem of efficient simulation on
      oblivious RAM.\nA machine is oblivious if thhe sequence in which it accesses
      memory locations is equivalent for any two inputs with the same running time.
      For example, an oblivious Turing Machine is one for which the movement of the
      heads on the tapes is identical for each computation. (Thus, the movement is
      independent of the actual input.) What is the slowdown in the running time of
      a machine, if it is required to be oblivious? In 1979, Pippenger and Fischer
      showed how a two-tape oblivious Turing Machine can simulate, on-line, a one-tape
      Turing Machine, with a logarithmic slowdown in the running time. We show an
      analogous result for the random-access machine (RAM) model of computation. In
      particular, we show how to do an on-line simulation of an arbitrary RAM by a
      probabilistic oblivious RAM with a polylogaithmic slowdown in the running time.
      On the other hand, we show that a logarithmic slowdown is a lower bound.", "venue":

      "title": "Quantum complexity theory", "abstract": "In this paper we study quantum
      computation from a complexity theoretic viewpoint. Our first result is the existence
      of an efficient universal quantum Turing machine in Deutsch''s model of a quantum
      Turing machine (QTM) [Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A, 400 (1985), pp. 97--117].
      This construction is substantially more complicated than the corresponding construction
      for classical Turing machines (TMs); in fact, even simple primitives such as
      looping, branching, and composition are not straightforward in the context of
      quantum Turing machines. We establish how these familiar primitives can be implemented
      and introduce some new, purely quantum mechanical primitives, such as changing
      the computational basis and carrying out an arbitrary unitary transformation
      of polynomially bounded dimension. \nWe also consider the precision to which
      the transition amplitudes of a quantum Turing machine need to be specified.
      We prove that $O(\\log T)$ bits of precision suffice to support a $T$ step computation.
      This justifies the claim that the quantum Turing machine model should be regarded
      as a discrete model of computation and not an analog one. \nWe give the first
      formal evidence that quantum Turing machines violate the modern (complexity
      theoretic) formulation of the Church--Turing thesis. We show the existence of
      a problem, relative to an oracle, that can be solved in polynomial time on a
      quantum Turing machine, but requires superpolynomial time on a bounded-error
      probabilistic Turing machine, and thus not in the class $\\BPP$. The class $\\BQP$
      of languages that are efficiently decidable (with small error-probability) on
      a quantum Turing machine satisfies $\\BPP \\subseteq \\BQP \\subseteq \\Ptime^{\\SP}$.
      Therefore, there is no possibility of giving a mathematical proof that quantum
      Turing machines are more powerful than classical probabilistic Turing machines
      (in the unrelativized setting) unless there is a major breakthrough in complexity
      theory.", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory of Computing", "year": 1993, "referenceCount":

      (Turing) model is a theoretical model used to explain self-regulated pattern
      formation in biology. Although many biologists have heard of this model, a better
      understanding of the concept would aid its application to many research projects
      and developmental principles. Kondo and Miura (p. 1616) now review the reaction-diffusion
      model. Despite the associated mathematics, the basic idea of the Turing model
      is relatively easy to understand and relates to morphogen gradients. In addition,
      user-friendly software makes it easy to understand how a whole variety of patterns
      can be produced by this simple mechanism. The Turing, or reaction-diffusion
      (RD), model is one of the best-known theoretical models used to explain self-regulated
      pattern formation in the developing animal embryo. Although its real-world relevance
      was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated
      much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide
      variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds
      of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application
      as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena.

      hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic
      would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems
      goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century
      and by Hilbert''s school in the 1920''s. Hilbert, noting that all of classical
      mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that
      the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula
      of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic.
      And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this \u201cdecision\u201d
      problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by
      Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable
      pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding
      significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival
      of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while
      no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof
      procedures available\u2014that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately
      locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which
      will usually involve seeking \u201cforever\u201d in the case of a formula which
      is not valid\u2014and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out
      to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery.\n Hao Wang [9] and P.
      C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures
      in quantification theory. Gilmore''s program employs a form of a basic theorem
      of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang''s makes use of a formulation
      of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both
      programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas
      of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional
      calculus. Wang''s program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves
      exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas
      Gilmore''s program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number
      of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods
      which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent
      important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly
      simple examples.\nIn the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification
      theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas
      and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the
      present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the
      fact that a formula on which Gilmore''s routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine
      to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully
      by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. \u00a76, below.\nIt
      should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures
      for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to \u201cgenuine\u201d
      mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are \u201cshort,\u201d must be obtained
      for various branches of mathematics. This last question will not be pursued
      further here; cf., however, Davis and Putnam [2], where one solution to this

      Theory Comput., 1993, pp. 11--20, SIAM J. Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1277--1339],
      [Simon, in Proc. 35th Annual IEEE Symposium Foundations Comput. Sci., 1994,
      pp. 116--123, SIAM J. Comput., 26 (1997), pp. 1340--1349], [Shor, in Proc. 35th
      Annual IEEE Symposium Foundations Comput. Sci., 1994, pp. 124--134] suggesting
      that quantum computers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers.
      Following Shor''s result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms
      are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all
      of $\\NP$ can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper,
      we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly
      at random with probability 1 the class $\\NP$ cannot be solved on a quantum
      Turing machine (QTM) in time $o(2^{n/2})$. We also show that relative to a permutation
      oracle chosen uniformly at random with probability 1 the class $\\NP \\cap \\coNP$
      cannot be solved on a QTM in time $o(2^{n/3})$. The former bound is tight since
      recent work of Grover [in {\\it Proc.\\ $28$th Annual ACM Symposium Theory Comput.},
      1996] shows how to accept the class $\\NP$ relative to any oracle on a quantum
      computer in time $O(2^{n/2})$.", "venue": "SIAM journal on computing (Print)",

      "title": "Outline for a Logical Theory of Adaptive Systems", "abstract": "The
      purpose of this paper is to outline a theory of automata appropriate to the
      properties, requirements and questions of adaptation. The conditions that such
      a theory should satisfy come from not one but several fields: It should be possible
      to formulate, at least in an abstract version, some of the key hypotheses and
      problems from relevant parts of biology, particularly the areas concerned with
      molecular control and neurophysiology. The work in theoretical genetics initiated
      by R. A. Fisher [5] and Sewall Wright [24] should find a natural place in the
      theory. At the same time the rigorous methods of automata theory should be brought
      to bear (particularly those parts concerned with growing automata [1, 2, 3,
      7, 8, 12, 15, 18, 23]). Finally the theory should include among its models abstract
      counterparts of artificial adaptive systems currently being studied, systems
      such as Newell-Shaw-Simon''s \"General Problem Solver\" [13], Selfridge''s \"Pandemonium\"
      [17], von Neumann''s self-reproducing automata [22] and Turing''s morphogenetic
      systems [19, 20]. The theory outlined here (which is intended as a theory and
      not the theory) is presented in four main parts. Section 2 discusses the study
      of adaptation via generation procedures and generated populations. Section 3
      defines a continuum of generation procedures realizable in a reasonably direct
      fashion. Section 4 discusses the realization of generation procedures as populations
      of interacting programs in an iterative circuit computer. Section 5 discusses
      the process of adaptation in the context of the earlier sections. The paper
      concludes with a discussion of the nature of the theorems of this theory. Before
      entering upon the detailed discussion, one general feature of the theory should
      be noted. The interpretations or models of the theory divide into two broad
      categories: \"complete\" models and \"incomplete\" models. The \"complete\"
      models comprise the artificial systems--systems with properties and specifications
      completely delimited at the outset (cf. the rules of a game). One set of \"complete\"
      models for the theory consists of various programmed parallel computers. The
      \"incomplete\" models encompass natural systems. Any natural system involves
      an unlimited number of factors and, inevitably, the theory can handle only a
      selected few of these. Because there will always be variables which do not have
      explicit counterparts in the theory, the derived statements must be approximate
      relative to natural systems. For this reason it helps greatly that", "venue":

      in unsupervised representation learning for natural language, we examine whether

      KNOWLEDGE", "abstract": "Humans are altering the composition of biological communities
      through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and
      species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components
      of the Earth''s biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons,
      but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the
      goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations,
      and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on
      biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present
      in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over
      space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate,
      resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties.
      Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification
      of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus
      on many aspects of the re- lationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning,
      including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress
      will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem
      properties, how ecological communities are struc- tured, and the forces driving
      species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management,
      we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the
      social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding
      this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species,
      is necessary for responsible management of Earth''s ecosystems and the diverse

      efficient method to determine high-resolution hypocenter locations over large
      distances. The location method incorporates ordinary absolute travel-time measurements
      and/or cross-correlation P-and S-wave differential travel-time measurements.
      Residuals between observed and theoretical travel-time differences (or double-differences)
      are minimized for pairs of earthquakes at each station while linking together
      all observed event-station pairs. A least-squares solu- tion is found by iteratively
      adjusting the vector difference between hypocentral pairs. The double-difference
      algorithm minimizes errors due to unmodeled velocity struc- ture without the
      use of station corrections. Because catalog and cross-correlation data are combined
      into one system of equations, interevent distances within multiplets are determined
      to the accuracy of the cross-correlation data, while the relative lo- cations
      between multiplets and uncorrelated events are simultaneously determined to
      the accuracy of the absolute travel-time data. Statistical resampling methods
      are used to estimate data accuracy and location errors. Uncertainties in double-difference
      locations are improved by more than an order of magnitude compared to catalog
      locations. The algorithm is tested, and its performance is demonstrated on two
      clus- ters of earthquakes located on the northern Hayward fault, California.

      "title": "Hopelessness depression: A theory-based subtype of depression.", "abstract":
      "Summary and Future Directions On the basis of the aforementioned studies, the
      hopelessnesstheory appears promising. However, further research is needed.For
      example, although powerful tests of the attributional diath-esis-stress component
      have been conducted, no one has exam-ined the cognitive diatheses of inferring
      negative consequencesor characteristics about the self or whether the cognitive
      stylediathesis-stress interaction predicts clinically significant de-pression.
      Moreover, it is crucial to determine if this interactionpredicts the development
      of the hypothesized symptoms ofhopelessness depression. More generally, an important
      short-coming of the prior work is that it has not focused on the symp-toms of
      hopelessness depression in particular and, instead, sim-ply has examined the
      symptoms of depression in general. Fu-ture investigators need to test more fine-grained
      predictionsabout the hypothesized symptoms of hopelessness depression.The issue
      of the stability of the cognitive diatheses has not beenresolved satisfactorily.
      We have only begun, in a preliminaryway, to investigate the issues of specific
      vulnerability and media-tional processes. Finally, further tests of the predictions
      aboutcourse, cure, and prevention are needed. We eagerly await thisresearch.Difficult
      methodological issues may arise in the search forhopelessness depression, however.
      For example, the hopeless-ness theory is silent about the time lag between formation
      ofhopelessness and onset of the symptoms of hopelessness depres-sion. If it
      is very short, then a major challenge will be to developmethods with sufficient
      temporal resolving power to determineif hopelessness indeed precedes the occurrence
      of the hypothe-sized symptoms of hopelessness depression (see Alloy, Hartlage,et
      al., 1988, for proposed methods for testing the hopelessnesstheory). The results
      of work to test the hopelessness theory willdetermine if the concept of hopelessness
      depression needs tobe revised. For example, perhaps the statement of the causalpathway
      is correc t bu culminate n a differen se f symp-toms than those currently hypothesized
      to compose hopeless-ness depression. In this case, the symptom\u2014but not
      thecause\u2014component of the hopelessness theory would need to bemodified.In
      discussing how to search for hopelessness depression, wenote the possibility
      that future work may not corroborate theexistence of hopelessness depression
      as a bona fide subtype withcharacteristic cause, symptoms, course, treatment,
      and preven-tion. Instead, the etiological chain featured in the hopelessnesstheory
      may be one of many pathways to a final common out-come of depression. In this
      case, it would be more compellingto speak of a hopelessness cause, as opposed
      to a hopelessnesssubtype, of depression.", "venue": "", "year": 1989, "referenceCount":

      "title": "The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation", "abstract": "After
      a brief introduction to the principles and promise of quantum information processing,
      the requirements for the physical implementation of quantum computation are
      discussed. These five requirements, plus two relating to the communication of
      quantum information, are extensively ex- plored and related to the many schemes
      in atomic physics, quantum optics, nuclear and electron magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
      superconducting electronics, and quantum-dot physics, for achiev- ing quantum
      computing. I. INTRODUCTION \ufffd The advent of quantum information processing,
      as an abstract concept, has given birth to a great deal of new thinking, of
      a very concrete form, about how to create physical computing devices that operate
      in the hitherto unexplored quantum mechanical regime. The efforts now underway
      to produce working laboratory devices that perform this profoundly new form
      of information pro- cessing are the subject of this book. In this chapter I
      provide an overview of the common objectives of the investigations reported
      in the remain- der of this special issue. The scope of the approaches, proposed
      and underway, to the implementation of quan- tum hardware is remarkable, emerging
      from specialties in atomic physics (1), in quantum optics (2), in nuclear (3)
      and electron (4) magnetic resonance spectroscopy, in su- perconducting device
      physics (5), in electron physics (6), and in mesoscopic and quantum dot research
      (7). This amazing variety of approaches has arisen because, as we will see,
      the principles of quantum computing are posed using the most fundamental ideas
      of quantum mechanics, ones whose embodiment can be contemplated in virtually
      every branch of quantum physics. The interdisciplinary spirit which has been
      fostered as a result is one of the most pleasant and remarkable fea- tures of
      this field. The excitement and freshness that has been produced bodes well for
      the prospect for discovery, invention, and innovation in this endeavor.", "venue":

      to the science of multiparticle quantum systems, including problems of electronic
      structure of molecules and of condensed matter. The first is in the area of

      "abstract": "HEN a pure bacterial culture is. attacked by a bacterial virus,
      the culW ture will clear after a few hours due to destruction of the sensitive
      ceIls by the virus. However, after further incubation for a few hours, or sometimes
      days, the culture will often become turbid again, due to the growth of a bacterial
      variant which is resistant to the action of the virus. This variant can be isolated
      and freed from the virus and will in many cases retain its resistance to the
      action of the virus even if subcultured through many generations in the absence
      of the virus. While the sensitive strain adsorbed the virus readily, the resistant
      variant will generally not show any affinity to it. The resistant bacterial
      variants appear readily in cultures grown from a single cell. They were, therefore,
      certainly not present when the culture was started. Their resistance is generally
      rather specific. It does not extend to viruses that are found to differ by other
      criteria from the strain in whose presence the resistant culture developed.
      The variant may differ from the original strain in morphological or metabolic
      characteristics, or in serological type or in colony type. Most often, however,
      no such correlated changes are apparent, and the variant may be distinguished
      from the original strain only by its resistance to the inciting strain of virus.
      The nature of these variants and the manner in which they originate have been
      discussed by many authors, and numerous attempts have been made to correlate
      the phenomenon with other instances of bacterial variation. The net effect of
      the addition of virus consists of the appearance of a variant strain, characterized
      by a new stable character-namely, resistance to the inciting virus. The situation
      has often been expressed by saying that bacterial viruses are powerful \u201cdissociating
      agents.\u201d While this expression summarizes adequately the net effect, it
      must not be taken to imply anything about the mechanism by which the result
      is brought about. A moment\u2019s reflection will show that there are greatly
      differing mechanisms which might produce the same end result. D\u2019HERELLE
      (1926) and many other investigators believed that the virus by direct action
      induced the resistant variants. GRATIA (1921), BURNET (I929), and others, on
      the other hand, believed that the resistant bacterial variants are produced
      by mutation in the culture prior to the addition of virus. The", "venue": "",

      variation in growth rate with temperature of unicellular algae suggests that
      an equation can be written to describe the maximum expected growth rate for
      temperatures less than 40\u00b0C. Measured rates of phytoplankton growth in
      the sea and in lakes are reviewed and compared with maximum expected rates.
      The assimilation number (i.e., rate of photosynthetic carbon assimilation per
      weight of chlorophyll a) for phytoplankton photosynthesis is related to the
      growth rate and the carbon/chlorophyll a ratio in the phytoplankton. Since maximum
      expected growth rate can be estimated from tempera\u00ad ture, the maximum expected
      assimilation number can also be estimated if the carbon/ chlorophyll a ratio
      in the phytoplankton crop is known. Many investigations of phytoplankton photosynthesis
      in the ocean have included measures of the assimilation number, while fewer
      data are available on growth rate. Assimilation numbers for Antarctic seas are
      low as would be expected from the low ambient temperatures. Tropical seas and
      temperate waters in summer often show low assimilation numbers as a result of
      low ambient nutrient concentrations. However, coastal estuaries with rapid nutrient
      regeneration processes show seasonal variations in the assimilation number with
      temperature which agree well with expectation. The variation in maximum expected

      Scientists often use directed acyclic graphs (dags) to model the qualitative
      struc\u00ad ture of causal theories, allowing the parameters to be estimated
      from observational data. Two causal models are equivalent if there is no experiment
      which could dis\u00ad tinguish one from the other. A canonical representation
      for causal models is pre\u00ad sented which yields an efficient graphical criterion
      for deciding equivalence, and provides a theoretical basis for extracting causal
      structures from empirical data. This representation is then extended to the
      more general case of an embedded causal model, that is, a dag in which only
      a subset of the variables are observ\u00ad able. The canonical representation
      presented here yields an efficient algorithm for determining when two embedded
      causal models reflect the same dependency information. This algorithm leads
      to a model theoretic definition of causation in terms of statistical dependencies.

      "title": "Physical one-way functions", "abstract": "Modern cryptography relies
      on algorithmic one-way functions\u2014numerical functions which are easy to
      compute but very difficult to invert. This dissertation introduces physical
      one-way functions and physical one-way hash functions as primitives for physical
      analogs of cryptosystems. \nPhysical one-way functions are defined with respect
      to a physical probe and physical system in some unknown state. A function is
      called a physical one-way function if (a)\u00a0there exists a deterministic
      physical interaction between the probe and the system which produces an output
      in constant time; (b)\u00a0inverting the function using either computational
      or physical means is difficult; (c)\u00a0simulating the physical interaction
      is computationally demanding and (d)\u00a0the physical system is easy to make
      but difficult to clone. \nPhysical one-way hash functions produce fixed-length
      output regardless of the size of the input. These hash functions can be obtained
      by sampling the output of physical one-way functions. For the system described
      below, it is shown that there is a strong correspondence between the properties
      of physical one-way hash functions and their algorithmic counterparts. In particular,
      it is demonstrated that they are collision-resistant and that they exhibit the
      avalanche effect, i.e., a small change in the physical system causes a large
      change in the hash value. \nAn inexpensive prototype authentication system based
      on physical one-way hash functions is designed, implemented, and analyzed. The
      prototype uses a disordered three-dimensional microstructure as the underlying
      physical system and coherent radiation as the probe. It is shown that the output
      of the interaction between the physical system and the probe can be used to
      robustly derive a unique tamper-resistant identifier at a very low cost per
      bit. The explicit use of three-dimensional structures marks a departure from
      prior efforts. Two protocols, including a one-time pad protocol, that illustrate
      the utility of these hash functions are presented and potential attacks on the
      authentication system are considered. \nFinally, the concept of fabrication
      complexity is introduced as a way of quantifying the difficulty of materially
      cloning physical systems with arbitrary internal states. Fabrication complexity
      is discussed in the context of an idealized machine\u2014a Universal Turing

      "title": "On a theory of computation and complexity over the real numbers: $NP$-
      completeness, recursive functions and universal machines", "abstract": "We present
      a model for computation over the reals or an arbitrary (ordered) ring R. In
      this general setting, we obtain universal machines, partial recursive functions,
      as well as JVP-complete problems. While our theory reflects the classical over
      Z (e.g., the computable functions are the recursive functions) it also reflects
      the special mathematical character of the underlying ring R (e.g., complements
      of Julia sets provide natural examples of R. E. undecidable sets over the reals)
      and provides a natural setting for studying foundational issues concerning algorithms
      in numerical analysis. Introduction. We develop here some ideas for machines
      and computation over the real numbers R. One motivation for this comes from
      scientific computation. In this use of the computer, a reasonable idealization
      has the cost of multiplication independent of the size of the number. This contrasts
      with the usual theoretical computer science picture which takes into account
      the number of bits of the numbers. Another motivation is to bring the theory
      of computation into the domain of analysis, geometry and topology. The mathematics
      of these subjects can then be put to use in the systematic analysis of algorithms.
      On the other hand, there is an extensively developed subject of the theory of
      discrete computation, which we don''t wish to lose in our theory. Toward this
      end we define machines, partial recursive functions, and other objects of study
      over a ring R. Then in the case where R is the ring of integers Z, we have the
      same objects (or perhaps equivalent objects) as the classical ones. Computable
      functions over Z are thus ordinary computable functions. R.E. sets over Z are
      ordinary R.E. sets. But when the ring is specialized to the real numbers, we
      have computable functions which are reasonable for the study of algorithms of
      numerical analysis. R.E. sets over R are no longer countable and include, for
      example, basins of attraction of complex analytic dynamical systems. Received

      1 2 LENORE BLUM, MIKE SHUB AND STEVE SMALE There is another virtue of developing
      a theory of machines over a ring. It forces a more algebraic approach, closer
      to classical mathematics, than the approach from logic. Here is an abbreviated
      description of some of the results of this paper, in this context of machines
      over a ring R. (I) Most Julia sets are not R.E. over the reals, so their complements,
      the basins of attraction, provide natural examples of R.E. undecidable sets
      over R (\u00a7\u00a71 and 10). The Julia set example provides an interesting
      link between the theory of computation and dynamical systems. A perhaps deeper
      link is the computing endomorphism (\u00a73) which is an important conceptual
      and technical tool used in our development. (II) An analogue of Cook''s JVP-completeness
      theorem is proved over the real numbers. The NP-complete problem over R is the
      4-Feasibility problem, i.e. the problem of deciding whether or not a real degree
      4 polynomial \u0192 : R\" -> R has a zero (\u00a76). This result, in addition
      to focusing attention on the 4-Feasibility problem over R has some interesting
      consequences which point to the subtle differences between the theories of NP
      over R and over Z. For example, by straightforward counting arguments, any NP-problem
      over Z is seen to be solvable in 2 time. (See e.g. Garey-Johnson.) An analogous
      result over the reals is far from obvious since there are a continuum of possible
      guesses over R. It is not even clear a priori that AT-problems over R are decidable.
      However, since the 4-Feasibility problem over R is decidable (by Tarski-Seidenberg)
      and since the current best upper bound for decidability of the existential theory
      of the reals is 4\u00b0^ (see Renegar, also Canny and Grigorev-Vorobjov), we
      also get exponential upper bounds for TVP-problems over R but for much deeper
      reasons than the case over Z. For another interesting difference between the
      two theories, note that by Hilbert''s Tenth Problem, the 4-Feasibility problem
      restated over Z is not even decidable over Z and so not in NP over Z. PROBLEM.
      What is the relation between the problems P = NP over R, and P = NP over Z?
      (III) Computable functions over R are characterized intrinsically by a class
      we call partial recursive functions over R. For JR = Z, these are the usual
      partial recursive functions (\u00a77). (IV) There exists a universal machine
      over R. This machine, inspired by the Universal Turing Machine, does the computation
      of any machine over R. The universal machine over R turns out to be independent
      of R. Moreover, by avoiding G\u00f6del coding via prime numbers, the algebraic
      structure of the universal machine remains intact (\u00a78). NP-COMPLETENESS,
      RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS AND UNIVERSAL MACHINES 3 (V) Inspired by the work of Davis,
      Robinson and Putnam, and Matijas\u00e8vic on Hubert''s tenth problem, we give
      a \"diophantine-like\" description of R.E. sets, for a certain class of machines
      (\u00a79). There are a large number of contributions of mathematicians and computer
      scientists which predate and relate to this work. A very brief survey, with
      some comparisons, follows. Of course, the work of Turing, G\u00f6del, Church
      and others in the thirties forms the core of the existing framework for our
      work. Although much of the classical theory of computation deals with computing
      over the natural numbers, certain approaches have considered other underlying
      domains. Close to the classical approach, Rabin developed a theory of computable
      algebra and fields in which the underlying domains can be effectively coded
      by natural numbers and are thus, necessarily countable. On the other hand, the
      theories of computation over abstract structures, are perhaps more general than
      ours. See e.g., Friedman (or as discussed by Shepherdson in Harrington, et al),
      Tiuryn, and Moschovakis. These general approaches both exploit and explore the
      logical properties of procedures. But, when applied to specific structures such
      as the reals, they do not yield the concrete mathematical results (e.g. about
      Julia sets or the 4-Feasibility problem) that quite naturally follow from the
      more mathematical model developed in this paper. Recursive analysis provides
      yet another approach. See, e.g. FriedmanKo, Pour-El-Richards, Hoover and Kreitz-Weihrauch.
      Some tools here are recursive functionals, computable real numbers and oracle
      Turing machines where, roughly, one imagines a real number fed to the machine
      bit by bit. To contrast, we view a real number not as its decimal (or binary)
      expansion, but rather a mathematical entity as is generally the practice in
      numerical analysis. Thus, for example, we suppose Newton''s algorithm for finding
      the zeroes of a polynomial \u0192 to be performed on an arbitrary real, not
      just a computable real; the fundamental components of the algorithm in our model,
      as in practice, are the rational operations Nf{x) = x f(x)/f''(x), not the bit
      operations. The development of algebraic complexity theory, in particular the
      work of Ostrowski, Pan, Winograd, Strassen and Sch\u00f6nhage (see von zur Gathen
      for a recent survey) gave rise to the \"real number model\" approach to computation.
      Decision and computation tree models as in Rabin, Steele-Yao, Ben-Or, and the
      tame machines in Smale, are such real number models of computation but considerably
      less powerful or general purpose than ours (e.g., they have bounded halting
      time and none are universal; also they don''t allow for uniform algorithms as
      do our infinite dimensional machines). More closely related are the register
      machines of Shepherdson-Sturgis and the RAM''s or random access machines. (See
      Aho-Hopcroft-Ullman or Machtey-Young for discrete versions.) While a definition
      of a real RAM is given in Preparata-Shamos, the formal development of a theory
      is not 4 LENORE BLUM, MIKE SHUB AND STEVE SMALE pursued. Indeed, in their book,
      only a subclass of machines, equivalent to the class of decision trees, is utilized.
      Perhaps closest to our approach is the work of Herman-hard on computability
      over arbitrary fields. Also close in spirit is a theory of real Turing machines
      outlined by Abramson. Nimrod Megiddo has also considered an example of an NP-complete
      over R in our model. Some other related papers are Borodin, Valiant, Endler,
      Lovdsz, and Eaves-Rothblum and TraubWozniakowski. Books having significant contact
      with this paper include Davis, Eilenberg, Manin, Manna, Minsky and Rogers. Especially
      in \u00a7\u00a75 and 6 below, the influence of complexity work of Cook and Karp
      (see Garey-Johnson) among many others, is evident. In our \u00a78, Robinson,
      Matijas\u00e8vic, Davis, and Putnam, and DenefhavG been influential. We would
      like to acknowledge helpful discussions with Martin Davis and Steve Simpson.

      the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface) \n \nThe study of formal languages
      constitutes an important subarea of computer science. This area sprang to life
      around 1956 when Noam Chomsky gave a mathematical model of a grammar in connection
      with his study of natural languages. Shortly afterwards, the concept of a grammar
      was found to be of great importance to the programmer when the syntax of the
      programming language ALGOL was defined by a context-free grammar. This development
      led naturally to syntax-directed compiling and the concept of a compiler compiler.
      Since then a considerable flurry of activity has taken place, the results of
      which have related formal languages and automata theory to such an extent that
      it is impossible to treat the areas separately. By now, no serious study of
      computer science would be complete without a knowledge of the techniques and
      results from language and automata theory. \n \nThis book presents the theory
      of formal languages as a coherent theory and makes explicit its relationship
      to automata. The book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description
      of a language. The fundamental descriptive device--the grammar--is explained,
      as well as its three major subclasses--regular, context-free, and context-sensitive
      grammars. The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as
      normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered. Four types of automata
      equivalent to the four types of grammars are described. These automata are the
      finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and
      the Turing machine. The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability
      of the halting problem shown. The book concludes with certain advanced topics
      in language theory--closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic
      pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability.", "venue":

      "title": "Initial Experiments on the End-Point Control of a Flexible One-Link
      Robot", "abstract": "It has been known for some time (Gevarter 1970) that if
      a flexible structure is controlled by locating every sensor exactly at the actuator
      it will control, then stable operation is easy to achieve. Nearly all commercial
      robots are controlled in this way, for this reason. So are most flexible spacecraft.
      Conversely, when one attempts to control a flexible struc ture by applying control
      torques at one end that are based on a sensor at the other end, the problem
      of achieving stability is severe. Solving it is an essential step for better
      control in space: the space-shuttle arm is a cogent example. The next generation
      of industrial robots will also need such control capability, for they will need
      to be much lighter in weight (to achieve quick response with modest energy),
      and they will need to achieve greater precision by employing end-point sensing.
      A set of experiments has been constructed to demonstrate control strategies
      for a single-link, very flexible manipulator, where the position of one end
      is to be sensed and precisely positioned by torquing at the other end. The objective
      of this first set of experiments is to uncover and solve problems related to
      the control of very flexible manipulators where sen sors are not colocated with
      the actuator. The experimental arrangement described here is also a test bed
      for new designs for flexible-structure controllers, designs that use insensitive,
      reduced-order control and adaptive control methods, for example. This paper
      describes the experimental arrangement, model identification, control design,
      and first experimental results. Some interesting results are the following.
      First, good stability can be achieved for such noncolocated systems, and reponse
      can be achieved that is effectively three times faster than the first natural
      cantilever period of the system: but a good model of the system dynamics and
      rather sophisticated control algorithms are essential to doing so. Even then,
      the system will always be conditionally stable. In addition to the tip sensor,
      a colocated rate sensor and nearly colocated strain gauges have been found to
      be very useful for achieving good closed-loop performance, that is, high gain
      and high band width. Second, there is an ultimate physical limit to achiev able
      response time, namely, the time required for a wave to travel the length of
      the member. Well-designed controllers can approach this limit. Third, the use
      of end-point sensing makes less critical the elaborate dynamic conditioning
      of position-command signals\u2014 \"model-following \" differentia tors, feed-forward,
      and the like\u2014such as are typically needed in present-generation robots
      that use \"dead reckoning\" in lieu of end-point sensing. With end-point sensing,
      feedback alone (suitably conditioned) is sufficient to whip the tip to the commanded
      position and hold it there precisely. Even more important, a shift in, for example,
      workpiece with respect to robot base, no longer produces an error.", "venue":

      "title": "Measures of Memory", "abstract": "ionist Positions Abstractionist
      positions view implicit memory as reflecting modification of the state of abstract
      lexical, semantic, or procedural knowledge structures; byionist positions view
      implicit memory as reflecting modification of the state of abstract lexical,
      semantic, or procedural knowledge structures; by contrast, explicit memory is
      assumed to depend on formation and retrieval of memory traces representing specific
      experiences. Abstractionists are often neuroscientifically oriented, using brain
      lesion data to constrain their theories. Of particular interest are findings
      that amnesic patients are selectively im\u00ad paired on direct tests of memory
      but show normal learning as measured by some indirect tests (reviewed below).
      These deficits are ascribed to an impairment of the system responsible for memory
      of specific experiences. In neuroscience, modularity of systems is the rule
      rather than the exception: If one accepts a straightforward relationship between
      brain systems and cogni\u00ad tive systems, the hypothesis of multiple memory
      systems is a logical exten\u00ad sion of current knowledge (Cohen 1984; Oakley
      1983; for discussion, see Cohen 1 985; Olton 1985; Schacter 1986) . Tu1ving''s
      (1972) heuristic distinction between episodic and semantic forms of memory was
      later developed into a multiple-system theory (Schacter & Tulving 1982a, b;
      Tulving 1983, 1984a) . Episodic memory \"deals with unique, concrete, personal,
      temporally dated events,\" while semantic mem\u00ad ory \"involves general,
      abstract, timeless knowledge that a person shares with others\" ( 1986, p. 307).
      In recent versions of the theory (Tulving 1984b,c; 486 RICHARDSON-KLA VEHN &
      BJORK 1985a,b,c; 1986) episodic memory is viewed as a specialized subsystem
      of semantic memory, with both systems embedded within a procedural memory, an
      arrangement Tulving terms monohierarchical. This position was designed to facilitate
      conceptualization of Tulving''s (1983) hypothesis of the phylogenetic evolution
      of episodic from semantic memory, and to account for recent arguments that whereas
      indirect memory measures reveal evidence of memory early in human ontogeny,
      the capacity to perfonn direct memory tasks first emerges only at 8-9 months
      of age (Schacter & Moscovitch 1984) . There are a number of other multiple-system
      formulations that are some\u00ad what analogous to the episodic-semantic distinction
      (e.g. Halgren 1984; Johnson 1983 ; Oakley 1983 ; O''Keefe & Nadel 1978; Olton
      et al 1979; Schacter & Moscovitch 1984; Warrington & Weiskrantz 1982) . One
      of these deserves special note: Morton''s (1969, 1970, 1979, 1981) mUltisystem
      theory differs from Tulving''s in that conceptual and factual knowledge, as
      well as personal or episodic memories, are dealt with by the same system (the
      cognitive system); a separate system contains abstract representations for words
      (logogens) that are responsible for lexical access. Other theorists regard the
      distinction between procedural and declarative (or propositional) memories (accepted
      by Tulving) as sufficient to explain the observed dissociations between direct
      and indirect measures (e.g. Baddeley 1984; Cohen 1984; McKoon et al 1986; Squire
      & Cohen 1984) . The pro\u00ad cedural/declarative distinction was originally
      formulated by workers in artifi\u00ad cial intelligence as a distinction between
      types of knowledge (e .g . Barr & Feigenbaum 1981; Winograd 1975) , but it has
      been extended into a multiple\u00ad system viewpoint (Cohen 1984; Squire & Cohen
      1984) . Procedural memory involves \"reorganization or other modification of
      existing processing struc\u00ad tures or procedures ,\" whereas declarative
      memory \"represents explicitly new data structures derived from the operation
      of any process or procedure\" (Cohen 1984, pp. 96-97). Although procedural memory
      can be revealed only when a task reengages prior processing operations, it is
      abstract in the sense that it does not record the specific prior events that
      caused those processing operations to be modified. The declarative system is
      considered to be respon\u00ad sible for conscious access to facts and past experiences;
      it is necessary for performance of direct memory tests, and is impaired in amnesia.
      An approach analogous to the procedural/declarative distinction is proposed
      by Mishkin (Mishkin et al 1984; Mishkin & Petri 1984) , who distinguishes between
      a memory system and a habit system. The distinction between activation and elaboration
      (Graf & Mandler 1984; Mandler 1980; Mandler et al 1986) is a process-oriented
      viewpoint; it differs from other abstractionist positions in being neutral with
      respect to the issue of memory systems. Activation of a preexisting mental representation
      \"strength\u00ad ens the relations among its components and increases its accessibility\"
      (Graf MEASURES OF MEMORY 487 & Mandler 1 984, p. 553); elaborative processing
      is necessary in order to retain new relationships and relate stimuli to the
      context in which they were presented. Activation alone is sufficient to result
      in processing facilitation that is revealed in indirect memory tests, whereas
      elaboration is necessary for direct tests of memory . A similar concept of trace
      activation has been proposed by Diamond & Rozin (1 984; see also Mortensen 1980)
      . Nonabstractionist Positions Nonabstractionists are unified by their disagreement
      with the necessity to distinguish abstract representations from memory traces
      that preserve in\u00ad formation from specific experiences. They are typically
      mainstream cognitive psychologists who concern themselves primarily with the
      behavior of normal human subjects. Kolers (e.g. 1979, 1 985; Kolers & Roediger
      1984; Kolers & Smythe 1 984) has attacked the distinction between procedural
      and declarative (or proposi\u00ad tional) knowledge, arguing that \"statements
      or declarations . . . do not fail of procedural representation\" (Kolers & Roediger
      1984, p. 437). When a subject displays knowledge, he/she is assumed to be engaging
      in a form of skilled performance. Knowledge is regarded as being specific to
      the processes by which that knowledge is acquired: Rather than offering a \"unitary\"
      theory in opposition to multisystem approaches, Kolers suggests that mentation
      con\u00ad sists of a multiplicity of processes whose properties are poorly correlated.
      Memory is revealed to the extent that processing operations at study and test
      overlap (the principle of transfer-appropriate processing, Bransford et al 1
      979) . Dissociations between direct and indirect measures of retention are to
      be expected when members of the two classes of task make different process\u00ad
      ing requirements , and not otherwise [see also Moscovitch et al ( 1986) for
      a similar viewpoint]. Jacoby ( 1983b) , Blaxton ( 1 985), and Roediger & Blaxton
      ( 1 987a,b) have used the terms conceptually driven and data-driven as a taxonomy
      of the processing demands of memory tests. Direct memory tests typically involve
      more conceptually driven than data-driven processing because the subject uses
      associative information to reconstruct the study episode mentally; in\u00ad
      direct memory tests typically involve more data-driven than conceptually driven
      processes because the subject focusses on external stimuli (e.g. a fragment
      of a word) at test. Dissociations between data-driven and con\u00ad ceptually
      driven memory tests would be expected as a function of the type of information
      (semantic-associative vs perceptual) encoded in a prior episode. Jacoby ( 1982,
      1983a,b, 1984, 1 987; Jacoby & Brooks 1984; Jacoby & Dallas 198 1 ; Jacoby &
      Witherspoon 1982) argues that implicit and explicit memory are reflections of
      \"different aspects of memory for whole prior processing episodes\" ( 1 983a,
      p. 21) . The aware and unaware aspects of 488 RICHARDSON-KLA VEHN & BJORK memory
      for episodes are assumed to result from differences in information provided
      by test cues, and possibly accompanying differences in retrieval processes (see
      Whittlesea 1 987 for a similar position).", "venue": "", "year": 1988, "referenceCount":

      doubting hen adequacy as a parent, and feeling isolated in what she at first

      from society and to hide in order to protect her son, her family, and herself.

      is no place like home.\u201d The author gives exacting attention to her efforts

      Mother and son\u2019s ultimately successful attempts to help one another come
      to terms with Stephen s sexuality, starting from mitial faltering missteps,
      are chronicled with dialogues that read almost like process recordings, so vivid
      are they in their detail. Drawing on hen own initial reaction to her son s homosexuality,
      Dew confronts the homophobia imbued in our culture and the toll it takes on
      gay children who struggle to keep their stigmatized identity a secret to avoid",

      locytic leukeUlia and on leukocytes froUl 3 healthy individuals (1 Ulale, 2
      feUlales). The cells were grown in cul ture for 2 to 4 days before exaUlination.
      Both in normal and in leukeIllic cells, the predOJninant Dletaphase chroUlo
      some nUIllber was 46. However, idio-gram analyses revealed a definite abnor
      Ulality, probably involving the Y chro mosome, in the 2 cases of chronic granulocytic
      leukemia. No chroIllo SOIlle abnormality was distinguil!hable in the 2 cases
      of acute leukeUlia (1 Illale, 1 feUlale) investigated. The results indicate
      that in SOUle leukeUlic hUUlan leukocytes sUlall but definite ChrOlllO sOIllal
