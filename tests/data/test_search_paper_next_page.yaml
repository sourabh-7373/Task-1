      Large-Scale Generative Language Model", "abstract": "Pretrained general-purpose
      language models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in various natural language
      processing domains by adapting to downstream tasks via zero-shot, few-shot and
      fine-tuning techniques. Because of their success, the size of these models has
      increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic
      techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort
      between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest
      monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG),
      with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure
      as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed
      and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
      corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
      to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results,
      as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
      We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
      accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.
      We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale
      training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language
      generations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount":

      hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is
      presented explicitly as a physical principle: \u2018every finitely realizible
      physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine
      operating by finite means\u2019. Classical physics and the universal Turing
      machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey
      the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing
      machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines
      is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ''universal quantum
      computer\u2019 are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling
      the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have
      many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do
      not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include
      \u2018quantum parallelism\u2019, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks
      can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
      restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable
      strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett\u2019s. Some
      of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the
      rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically
      more reasonable definition of the \u2018complexity\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019

      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands,
      which prove to be better for water desalination. Science, this issue p. 518
      Turing structures generated via diffusion-driven instabilities make polyamide
      membranes for water desalination. The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental
      importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications
      have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based
      on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for
      water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions
      enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes
      exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound
      line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence
      of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport
      through the membranes is enhanced.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "title": "Dissecting the NVidia Turing T4 GPU via Microbenchmarking", "abstract":
      "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs, coupled
      with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a hurdle
      for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
      Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
      using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s
      latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine
      Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations.
      Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications.
      We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the
      P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
      higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study
      the performance of the T4''s TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on
      low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces
      new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s
      instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions.
      We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as
      the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large
      as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4
      memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over
      its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
      workloads that hit power or thermal limits. \nMany of our findings are novel,
      published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software
      developers get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "Stochastic Turing patterns in a synthetic bacterial population", "abstract":
      "Significance In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could
      arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing
      inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing\u2019s conditions are disappointingly
      hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts
      pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered
      bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor
      system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered
      patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively
      with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms,
      driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much
      broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin of biological
      morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our
      understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952,
      Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability
      of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion
      systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing
      activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and
      the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called
      into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator\u2013inhibitor
      birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts
      the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with
      no severe requirement on the ratio of activator\u2013inhibitor diffusion coefficients.
      To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically
      engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules
      form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming
      gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered
      bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale
      much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental
      patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These
      results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity,
      can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings
      provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising
      from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.",

      but less is known concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous
      media. It is non-trivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent
      spatial heterogeneity from emergent patterning due to nonlinear instability.
      We employ WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
      which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions. We find that the
      structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical trigonometric
      functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of different growth
      rates are localized to different spatial regions. This localization helps explain
      common amplitude modulations observed in simulations of Turing systems in heterogeneous
      settings. We numerically demonstrate this theory, giving an illustrative example
      of the emergent instabilities and the striking complexity arising from spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion systems. Our results give insight both
      into systems driven by exogenous heterogeneity, as well as successive pattern
      forming processes, noting that most scenarios in biology do not involve symmetry
      breaking from homogeneity, but instead consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous
      states. The instability mechanism reported here precisely captures such evolution,

      Spiking neural P systems with communication on request (SNQ P systems) are a
      type of spiking neural P system where the spikes are requested from neighboring
      neurons. SNQ P systems have previously been proved to be universal (computationally
      equivalent to Turing machines) when two types of spikes are considered. This
      paper studies a simplified version of SNQ P systems, i.e. SNQ P systems with
      one type of spike. It is proved that one type of spike is enough to guarantee
      the Turing universality of SNQ P systems. Theoretical results are shown in the
      cases of the SNQ P system used in both generating and accepting modes. Furthermore,
      the influence of the number of unbounded neurons (the number of spikes in a
      neuron is not bounded) on the computation power of SNQ P systems with one type
      of spike is investigated. It is found that SNQ P systems functioning as number
      generating devices with one type of spike and four unbounded neurons are Turing

      researchers today believe that each finger forms because of its unique position
      within the early limb bud. However, 30 years ago, developmental biologists proposed
      that the arrangement of fingers followed the Turing pattern, a self-organizing
      process during early embryo development. Raspopovic et al. provide evidence
      to support a Turing mechanism (see the Perspective by Zuniga and Zeller). They
      reveal that Bmp and Wnt signaling pathways, together with the gene Sox9, form
      a Turing network. The authors used this network to generate a computer model
      capable of accurately reproducing the patterns that cells follow as the embryo

      by Zuniga and Zeller] During limb development, digits emerge from the undifferentiated
      mesenchymal tissue that constitutes the limb bud. It has been proposed that
      this process is controlled by a self-organizing Turing mechanism, whereby diffusible
      molecules interact to produce a periodic pattern of digital and interdigital
      fates. However, the identities of the molecules remain unknown. By combining

      simulation of digit patterning and show that this network, when modulated by
      morphogen gradients, recapitulates the expression patterns of Sox9 in the wild

      "title": "Visual Turing test for computer vision systems", "abstract": "Significance
      In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods
      of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations
      measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according
      to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding.
      We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares
      a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to
      probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition
      to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy
      in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated
      by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a
      story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted
      device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given
      test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides
      the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes
      the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered
      to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s
      answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question.
      Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural
      language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned
      from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the
      answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,
      is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test
      is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions
      that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object,
      through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other
      uniquely instantiated objects.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy

      Vertebrates have a vast array of epithelial appendages, including scales, feathers,

      explained by Alan Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion system. However, the role

      We investigate patterning of the unique tooth-like skin denticles of sharks,

      through simulation models that a Turing-like mechanism can explain shark denticle
      patterning and verify this system using gene expression analysis and gene pathway
      inhibition experiments. This mechanism bears remarkable similarity to avian
      feather patterning, suggesting deep homology of the system. We propose that

      "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during
      embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular
      mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that
      tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of
      chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously
      arising from specific chemical interactions (such as \u201cTuring-patterns\u201d).
      Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products
      of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories,
      and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively
      influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus
      on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development.
      On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical
      simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of
      the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical
      behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied
      using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis
      to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development.
      On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even
      simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead
      to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that
      the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories
      are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning

      "What can artificial intelligence teach us about the mind? If AI''s underlying
      concept is that thinking is a computational process, then how can computation
      illuminate thinking? It''s a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the buzziest
      AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer systems that learn intelligent
      behavior from massive amounts of data. This is what powers a driverless car,
      for example. In this book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to \"good
      old fashioned artificial intelligence,\" which is based not on heaps of data
      but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind of artificial intelligence
      is equipped to handle situations that depart from previous patterns -- as we
      do in real life, when, for example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when
      the barista informs us there''s no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
      of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that passes the famous
      Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he proposes another way to test
      for intelligence -- the Winograd Schema Test, developed by Levesque and his
      colleagues. \"If our goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we had better
      understand the difference between making it and faking it,\" he observes. He
      identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the capacity to call
      on background knowledge: the ability to represent objects of thought symbolically.
      As AI migrates more and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems
      without common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.", "venue":

      patterning with equally diffusing signals", "abstract": "The Turing reaction-diffusion
      model explains how identical cells can self-organize to form spatial patterns.
      It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different
      diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous
      signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical
      analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals
      that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern
      with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients.
      We provide a software (available at http://www.RDNets.com) to explore these
      networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental
      data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control
      embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how
      existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form
      Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework
      to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use

      estimate species richness if there are many almost undetectable species in a
      hyper\u2010diverse community. Practically, an accurate lower bound for species
      richness is preferable to an inaccurate point estimator. The traditional nonparametric
      lower bound developed by Chao (1984, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11,
      265\u2013270) for individual\u2010based abundance data uses only the information
      on the rarest species (the numbers of singletons and doubletons) to estimate
      the number of undetected species in samples. Applying a modified Good\u2013Turing
      frequency formula, we derive an approximate formula for the first\u2010order
      bias of this traditional lower bound. The approximate bias is estimated by using
      additional information (namely, the numbers of tripletons and quadrupletons).
      This approximate bias can be corrected, and an improved lower bound is thus
      obtained. The proposed lower bound is nonparametric in the sense that it is
      universally valid for any species abundance distribution. A similar type of
      improved lower bound can be derived for incidence data. We test our proposed
      lower bounds on simulated data sets generated from various species abundance
      models. Simulation results show that the proposed lower bounds always reduce
      bias over the traditional lower bounds and improve accuracy (as measured by
      mean squared error) when the heterogeneity of species abundances is relatively
      high. We also apply the proposed new lower bounds to real data for illustration
      and for comparisons with previously developed estimators.", "venue": "Biometrics",

      to Alan Turing, reflects on Turing''s personality in order to better understand

      lives the dramatic quest for an undetectable imitation of a man, a woman, a
      machine. He makes us see the continuous deformations of a material action/reaction/diffusion

      way to new scientific paths with major consequences for contemporary live and
      for knowledge. The uses and the effects of these investigations will be discussed:
      the passage from classical AI to today''s neural nets, the relevance of non-linearity
      in biological dynamics, but also their abuses, such as the myth of a computational
      world, from a Turing-machine like universe to an encoded homunculus in the DNA.

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines", "abstract": "The expressive
      power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential
      computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been
      more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number
      of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing
      Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even greater number
      of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its
      memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM
      can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory is relatively
      easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire memory content
      at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement a fast NTM.
      In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to access the memory,
      while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the memory. We call this
      model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access a constant number of
      memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation can be faster.
      The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn programs of unbounded
      running time. We successfully trained the RL-NTM to solve a number of algorithmic
      tasks that are simpler than the ones solvable by the fully differentiable NTM.
      As the RL-NTM is a fairly intricate model, we needed a method for verifying
      the correctness of our implementation. To do so, we developed a simple technique
      for numerically checking arbitrary implementations of models that use Reinforce,

      proper Interfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces include
      memory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as a theorem
      verifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers of the model.
      However, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases and search engines,
      are discrete. \nWe examine feasibility of learning models to interact with discrete
      Interfaces. We investigate the following discrete Interfaces: a memory Tape,
      an input Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm

      "abstract": "Significance Turing proposed that intercellular reaction-diffusion
      of molecules is responsible for morphogenesis. The impact of this paradigm has
      been profound. We exploit an abiological experimental system of emulsion drops
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reactants ideally suited to test Turing\u2019s
      theory. Our experiments verify Turing\u2019s thesis of the chemical basis of
      morphogenesis and reveal a pattern, not previously predicted by theory, which
      we explain by extending Turing\u2019s model to include heterogeneity. Quantitative
      experimental results obtained using this artificial cellular system establish
      the strengths and weaknesses of the Turing model, applicable to biology and
      materials science alike, and pinpoint which directions are required for improvement.
      Alan Turing, in \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d [Turing AM (1952)
      Philos Trans R Soc Lond 237(641):37\u201372], described how, in circular arrays
      of identical biological cells, diffusion can interact with chemical reactions
      to generate up to six periodic spatiotemporal chemical structures. Turing proposed
      that one of these structures, a stationary pattern with a chemically determined
      wavelength, is responsible for differentiation. We quantitatively test Turing\u2019s
      ideas in a cellular chemical system consisting of an emulsion of aqueous droplets
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillatory chemical reactants, dispersed
      in oil, and demonstrate that reaction-diffusion processes lead to chemical differentiation,
      which drives physical morphogenesis in chemical cells. We observe five of the
      six structures predicted by Turing. In 2D hexagonal arrays, a seventh structure
      emerges, incompatible with Turing\u2019s original model, which we explain by
      modifying the theory to include heterogeneity.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "title": "Globally stable microresonator Turing pattern formation for coherent
      high-power THz radiation on-chip", "abstract": "In nonlinear microresonators
      driven by continuous-wave (cw) lasers, Turing patterns have been studied in
      the formalism of Lugiato-Lefever equation with emphasis on its high coherence
      and exceptional robustness against perturbations. Destabilization of Turing
      pattern and transition to spatio-temporal chaos, however, limits the available
      energy carried in the Turing rolls and prevents further harvest of their high
      coherence and robustness to noise. Here we report a novel scheme to circumvent
      such destabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations,
      and attain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear
      oscillators, achieving a record high power conversion efficiency of 45% and
      an elevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern is
      discretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency
      sideband non-uniformity measured at 7.3x10^-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous
      microwave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution stages
      through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free running Turing roll
      coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is transferred onto a
      plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest power THz coherent generation at
      room-temperature, with 1.1% optical-to-THz power conversion. Its long-term stability
      can be further improved by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching an Allan
      deviation of 6x10^-10 at 100 s, with a simple computer-aided slow feedback control.
      The demonstrated on-chip coherent high-power Turing-THz system is promising
      to find applications in astrophysics, medical imaging, and wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "\n \n Penetration testing (pentesting) is a well established method
      for identifying security weaknesses, by conducting friendly attacks. Simulated
      pentesting automates this process, through designing a model of the system at
      hand, and using model-based attack planning to generate the attacks. Classical
      planning variants of this idea are being used commercially by the pentesting
      industry since 2010. Such models can pinpoint potentially dangerous combinations
      of known vulnerabilities, but ignore the incomplete knowledge characteristic
      of hacking from the attacker''s point of view. Yet, ideally, the simulation
      should conduct its attacks the same way a real attacker would. Hence the ultimate
      goal is much more ambitious: to realistically simulate a human hacker. This
      is a grand vision indeed; e.g., the classical Turing Test can be viewed as a
      sub-problem. Taking a more practical perspective, the simulated pentesting model
      space spans a broad range of sequential decision making problems. Analyzing
      prior work in AI and other relevant areas, we derive a systematization of this
      model space, highlighting a multitude of interesting challenges to AI sequential
      decision making research.\n \n", "venue": "International Conference on Automated

      "The formation of ordered structures, in particular Turing patterns, in complex

      simple cell of a spatially-extended circuit architecture allows us to design
      systems able to generate Turing patterns. In addition, the memristor parameters
      play a key role in the selection of the type and characteristics of the emerging
      pattern, which is also influenced by the initial conditions. The problem of
      finding the regions of parameters where Turing patterns may emerge in the proposed

      "Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning
      tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,
      add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly
      in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,
      and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
      \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
      For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following
      two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well
      as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to
      a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the
      best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but
      as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all
      symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
      over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant
      of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
      from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
      1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
      at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
      and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "Neural

      "Alan Turing was neither a biologist nor a chemist, and yet the paper he published
      in 1952, \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019, on the spontaneous
      formation of patterns in systems undergoing reaction and diffusion of their
      ingredients has had a substantial impact on both fields, as well as in other
      areas as disparate as geomorphology and criminology. Motivated by the question
      of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such as
      a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random
      fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial uniformity.
      The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far away from its
      equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial
      ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms, of which Turing''s
      model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason, these patterns show
      striking similarities in systems that seem superficially to share nothing in
      common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation on a zebra skin.
      New examples of \u2018Turing patterns'' in biology and beyond are still being
      discovered today. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary

      the two instability mechanisms, which dictates two completely novel scenarios.
      At low detunings from resonance, switching occurs between the stable stationary
      lower branch and the Faraday-unstable upper branch, whereas at high detunings
      we observe the crossover between the Turing and Faraday periodic structures.

      "title": "Towards a Visual Turing Challenge", "abstract": "As language and visual
      understanding by machines progresses rapidly, we are observing an increasing
      interest in holistic architectures that tightly interlink both modalities in
      a joint learning and inference process. This trend has allowed the community
      to progress towards more challenging and open tasks and refueled the hope at
      achieving the old AI dream of building machines that could pass a turing test
      in open domains. In order to steadily make progress towards this goal, we realize
      that quantifying performance becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore we ask
      how we can precisely define such challenges and how we can evaluate different
      algorithms on this open tasks? In this paper, we summarize and discuss such
      challenges as well as try to give answers where appropriate options are available
      in the literature. We exemplify some of the solutions on a recently presented
      dataset of question-answering task based on real-world indoor images that establishes
      a visual turing challenge. Finally, we argue despite the success of unique ground-truth
      annotation, we likely have to step away from carefully curated dataset and rather
      rely on ''social consensus'' as the main driving force to create suitable benchmarks.
      Providing coverage in this inherently ambiguous output space is an emerging
      challenge that we face in order to make quantifiable progress in this area.",

      "abstract": "Significance Corneal surfaces of some insects are coated with nipple-like
      nanostructures reducing the light reflection. Here we provide an extensive analysis
      of corneae across insect groups. Using atomic force microscopy, we discover
      a striking diversity of corneal nanocoatings, omnipresent in arthropods. These
      fascinating bionanostructures replicate the complete set of the Turing patterns\u2014shapes
      resulting from the reaction\u2212diffusion modeling underlying many examples
      of patterning in biological and physicochemical systems. Our work, verging on
      the interface of nanotechnology and zoology, evolution and biophysics, and ecology
      and genetics, sheds light on the molecular origin and evolutionary diversification
      of a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures. It also describes,
      to our knowledge, the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.
      Nipple-like nanostructures covering the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies,
      and Drosophila have been studied by electron and atomic force microscopy, and
      their antireflective properties have been described. In contrast, corneal nanostructures
      of the majority of other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined
      by methods that did not allow precise morphological characterization. Here we
      provide a comprehensive analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing
      a rich diversity of insect corneal nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are categorized
      into four major morphological patterns and various transitions between them,
      many, to our knowledge, never described before. Remarkably, this unexpectedly
      diverse range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing
      patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled by
      Alan Turing in his famous reaction\u2212diffusion system. These findings reveal
      a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures and shed light on their
      molecular origin and evolutionary diversification. They may also be the first-ever

      and can significantly change the dynamics of these systems. Quite a few works
      have been focused on analyzing the effect of small delays on the pattern formation
      of biological systems. In this paper, we investigate the effect of any delay
      on the formation of Turing patterns of reaction-diffusion equations. First,
      for a delay system in a general form, we propose a technique calculating the
      critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs. Then
      we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern formation
      of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find that when
      the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular patterns,
      which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large delay we find
      spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find that the critical
      delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying capacity to half saturation
      of the prey density.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      "abstract": "We study the computational capabilities of a biologically inspired
      neural model where the synaptic weights, the connectivity pattern, and the number
      of neurons can evolve over time rather than stay static. Our study focuses on
      the mere concept of plasticity of the model so that the nature of the updates
      is assumed to be not constrained. In this context, we show that the so-called
      plastic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of the precise super-Turing
      computational power--as the static analog neural networks--irrespective of whether
      their synaptic weights are modeled by rational or real numbers, and moreover,
      irrespective of whether their patterns of plasticity are restricted to bi-valued
      updates or expressed by any other more general form of updating. Consequently,
      the incorporation of only bi-valued plastic capabilities in a basic model of
      RNNs suffices to break the Turing barrier and achieve the super-Turing level
      of computation. The consideration of more general mechanisms of architectural
      plasticity or of real synaptic weights does not further increase the capabilities
      of the networks. These results support the claim that the general mechanism
      of plasticity is crucially involved in the computational and dynamical capabilities
      of biological neural networks. They further show that the super-Turing level

      "title": "Alan Turing : His Work and Impact", "abstract": "Some may wonder whether
      the level of praise that has been lavished on Turing is justified. Yes, the
      1936 paper in which he defined what are now known as Turing machines is a landmark
      in the history of science, but other logicians at the time were involved in
      the development of formal models of computation, including Herbrand, G\u00f6del,
      Post, and Church. And, although Turing played an important part in the development
      of the modern electronic computer, his role should not be overstated: a number
      of early computing devices were built from the late 1930\u2019s to mid-1940\u2019s
      with little or no influence of Turing\u2019s early foundational work, and the
      real history involves a complex mix of theoretical and practical insights, with
      contributions from a substantial cast of researchers and engineers alongside
      Turing. Finally, although the hideous abuses that Turing was subjected to as
      a homosexual in postwar Britain are made even more ironic by the role he played
      in helping the allies win the war, those abuses are no more morally offensive
      than those suffered by countless others whose lives are left uncelebrated. With
      all this in mind, it is reasonable to ask: was all the hoopla really called
      for? One need only sit down with Turing\u2019s work for an hour or two, however,
      to find such doubts pushed aside. His papers are full of technical detail, but
      are surprisingly easy to read. His writing is careful and methodical, but even
      after all these years the work feels creatively fresh and original. He dealt
      with weighty topics and raised important questions, but relied on technical
      mastery and a good deal of hard work to back up his answers. When we read",

      Game - Updated Edition", "abstract": "Alan Turing died in 1954, but the themes
      of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from
      a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations
      for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges: Alan had proved that there
      was no \"miraculous machine\" that could solve all mathematical problems, but
      in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea
      of a universal machine that could take over the work of any machine. During
      World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret
      British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German''s Enigma machine code
      was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because
      his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security,
      implemented with machines and remorseless logic: \"It was his own invention,
      and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.\" Andrew Hodges''s remarkable
      insight weaves Turing''s mathematical and computer work with his personal life
      to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek
      Jacobi movie Breaking the Code. Hodges has the mathematical knowledge to explain
      the intellectual significance of Turing''s work, while never losing sight of
      the human and social picture: In this sense his life belied his work, for it
      could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life
      raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the
      body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society,
      the individual and history. And Hodges admits what all biographers know, but
      few admit, about their subjects: \"his inner code remains unbroken.\" Alan Turing

      "abstract": "It is hard to bridge the gap between mathematical formulations
      and biological implementations of Turing patterns, yet this is necessary for
      both understanding and engineering these networks with synthetic biology approaches.
      Here, we model a reaction\u2013diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable
      regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology
      study in mammalian cells.1 The model employs a single promoter to express both
      the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large regions
      of parameter space, using biologically interpretable Hill function reactions.
      We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing biologically
      tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of successful patterning.
      We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time evolution by manipulating
      the values for production and degradation relationships. More importantly, our
      analysis predicts that steep dose\u2013response functions arising from cooperativity
      are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness increases parameter space
      and even reduces the requirement for differential diffusion between activator
      and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some of the limitations of linear scenarios
      for reaction\u2013diffusion systems and will help to guide projects to engineer
      synthetic Turing patterns.", "venue": "ACS Synthetic Biology", "year": 2014,

      "During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing 1912--1954 has been widely
      celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption,
      Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate Turing''s
      motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as
      expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments
      within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In
      particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also
      the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level
      AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine a machine
      which learns like an infant dominates the closing section of the paper, in which
      he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three
      alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: 1 AI by programming,
      2 AI by ab initio machine learning and 3 AI using logic, probabilities, learning
      and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in
      the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We
      compare Turing''s three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude
      with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper.",

      exponent on pattern formation and pattern selection are studied. Our linear
      stability analysis shows that the wave number of the Turing pattern increases
      with the superdiffusive exponent. A weakly nonlinear analysis yields a system
      of amplitude equations and the analysis of these amplitude equations predicts
      parameter regimes where hexagons, stripes, and their coexistence are expected.
      Numerical simulations of the activator-inhibitor model near the stability boundaries
      confirm our analytical results. Since diffusion rate manifests in both diffusion
      constant and diffusion exponent, we numerically explore their interactions on
      the emergence of Turing patterns. When the activator and inhibitor have different
      superdiffusive exponents, we find that the critical ratio of the diffusion rate
      of the inhibitor to the activator, required for the formation of the Turing
      pattern, increases monotonically with the superdiffusive exponent. We conclude
      that small ratio (than unity) of anomalous diffusion exponent between the inhibitor
      and activator is more likely to promote the emergence of the Turing pattern,

      theoretical ideas to people producing actual machines was significant and appreciated
      by everybody involved in computing from the moment he published his 1936 paper
      \u2018On Computable Numbers\u2019. Careful historians are aware that this popular
      conception is deeply misleading. We know from previous work by Campbell-Kelly,
      Aspray, Akera, Olley, Priestley, Daylight, Mounier-Kuhn, Haigh, and others that
      several computing pioneers, including Aiken, Eckert, Mauchly, and Zuse, did
      not depend on (let alone were they aware of) Turing''s 1936 universal-machine
      concept. Furthermore, it is not clear whether any substance in von Neumann''s
      celebrated 1945 \u2018First Draft Report on the EDVAC\u2019 is influenced in
      any identifiable way by Turing''s work. This raises the questions: (i) When
      does Turing enter the field? (ii) Why did the Association for Computing Machinery
      (ACM) honor Turing by associating his name to ACM''s most prestigious award,
      the Turing Award? Previous authors have been rather vague about these questions,
      suggesting some date between 1950 and the early 1960s as the point at which
      Turing is retroactively integrated into the foundations of computing and associating
      him in some way with the movement to develop something that people call computer
      science. In this paper, based on detailed examination of hitherto overlooked
      primary sources, attempts are made to reconstruct networks of scholars and ideas
      prevalent in the 1950s, and to identify a specific group of actors interested
      in theorizing about computations in computers and attracted to the idea of language
      as a frame in which to understand computation. By going back to Turing''s 1936
      paper and, more importantly, to re-cast versions of Turing''s work published
      during the 1950s (Rosenbloom, Kleene, Markov), I identify the factors that made
      this group of scholars particularly interested in Turing''s work and provided
      the original vector by which Turing became to be appreciated in retrospect as

      presents some important issues on misidentification of human interlocutors in
      text-based communication during practical Turing tests. The study here presents
      transcripts in which human judges succumbed to theconfederate effect, misidentifying
      hidden human foils for machines. An attempt is made to assess the reasons for
      this. The practical Turing tests in question were held on 23 June 2012 at Bletchley
      Park, England. A selection of actual full transcripts from the tests is shown
      and an analysis is given in each case. As a result of these tests, conclusions
      are drawn with regard to the sort of strategies which can perhaps lead to erroneous
      conclusions when one is involved as an interrogator. Such results also serve
      to indicate conversational directions to avoid for those machine designers who
      wish to create a conversational entity that performs well on the Turing test.",

      of a Turing-Type Mechanism", "abstract": "Digit Determination Pentadactyly has
      been an early and rapid innovation of tetrapods. Sheth et al. (p. 1476) report
      that a dramatic reduction in distally expressed Hox genes, in the absence of
      a functional morphogen signaling pathway, results in extreme polydactyly in
      mice. Mutant digits exhibited patterns reminiscent of the endoskeleton of fins,
      suggesting that an ancestral patterning mechanism has been deeply conserved
      in evolution. Mouse genetics and computer modeling suggest that a reaction-diffusion
      mechanism defines digit pattern. The formation of repetitive structures (such
      as stripes) in nature is often consistent with a reaction-diffusion mechanism,
      or Turing model, of self-organizing systems. We used mouse genetics to analyze
      how digit patterning (an iterative digit/nondigit pattern) is generated. We
      showed that the progressive reduction in Hoxa13 and Hoxd11-Hoxd13 genes (hereafter
      referred to as distal Hox genes) from the Gli3-null background results in progressively
      more severe polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely packed digits. Combined
      with computer modeling, our results argue for a Turing-type mechanism underlying
      digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes modulates the digit
      period or wavelength. The phenotypic similarity with fish-fin endoskeleton patterns
      suggests that the pentadactyl state has been achieved through modification of
      an ancestral Turing-type mechanism.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

      "Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy, homogenous
      initial conditions and have been proposed as patterning mechanism for many developmental
      processes. However, the molecular components that give rise to Turing patterns
      have remained elusive, and the small size of the parameter space that permits
      Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to explain how Turing patterns
      could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing patterns can be obtained with
      a single ligand if the ligand-receptor interaction is taken into account. Here
      we show that the general properties of ligand-receptor systems result in very
      large Turing spaces. Thus, the restriction of receptors to single cells, negative
      feedbacks, regulatory interactions among different ligand-receptor systems,
      and the clustering of receptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the
      Turing space. We further show that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10-SHH
      network that controls lung branching morphogenesis are sufficient to result
      in large Turing spaces. We conclude that the cellular restriction of receptors
      provides a mechanism to sufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to
      make the evolution of Turing patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then
      have further enlarged the Turing space. Given their robustness and flexibility,
      we propose that receptor-ligand-based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism
      for patterning in biology.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      formation. We study the process of pattern formation both in one-dimensional
      and two-dimensional spatial domains. Through a weakly nonlinear multiple scales
      analysis we derive the equations for the amplitude of the stationary patterns.
      The analysis of the amplitude equations shows the occurrence of a number of
      different phenomena, including stable supercritical and subcritical Turing patterns
      with multiple branches of stable solutions leading to hysteresis. Moreover,
      we consider traveling patterning waves: When the domain size is large, the pattern
      forms sequentially and traveling wave fronts are the precursors to patterning.
      We derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation and describe the traveling front enveloping
      a pattern which invades the domain. We show the emergence of radially symmetric

      kidney branching have been defined. Yet the underlying mechanism is still elusive.
      We have previously shown that a Schnakenberg-type Turing mechanism can recapitulate
      the branching and protein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant lungs,
      but it is unclear whether this mechanism would extend to other branched organs
      that are regulated by other proteins. Here, we show that the glial cell line-derived
      neurotrophic factor\u2013RET regulatory interaction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type
      Turing model that reproduces the observed budding of the ureteric bud from the
      Wolffian duct, its invasion into the mesenchyme and the observed branching pattern.
      The model also recapitulates all relevant protein expression patterns in wild-type
      and mutant mice. The lung and kidney models are both based on a particular receptor\u2013ligand
      interaction and require (1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2)
      a lower diffusion coefficient for the receptor than for the ligand and (3) an
      increase in the receptor concentration in response to receptor\u2013ligand binding
      (by enhanced transcription, more recycling or similar). These conditions are

      Alan Turing''s hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about one
      of Turing''s obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and free
      will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call \"Knightian freedom\":
      a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic
      unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as
      possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently
      by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries to find scope
      for \"freedom\" in the universe''s boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical
      laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems.
      I investigate how far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the
      way, encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement
      problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb''s
      paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior
      Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations
      of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time,
      quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which
      has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting
      empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old

      is how the vast range of pattern and structure we observe in nature emerges
      from an almost uniformly homogeneous fertilized egg. In particular, the mechanisms
      by which biological systems maintain robustness, despite being subject to numerous
      sources of noise, are shrouded in mystery. Postulating plausible theoretical
      models of biological heterogeneity is not only difficult, but it is also further
      complicated by the problem of generating robustness, i.e. once we can generate
      a pattern, how do we ensure that this pattern is consistently reproducible in
      the face of perturbations to the domain, reaction time scale, boundary conditions
      and so forth. In this paper, not only do we review the basic properties of Turing''s
      theory, we highlight the successes and pitfalls of using it as a model for biological
      systems, and discuss emerging developments in the area.", "venue": "Interface

      computer science, we present a novel numerical approach, motivated by the notion
      of algorithmic probability, to the problem of approximating the Kolmogorov-Chaitin
      complexity of short strings. The method is an alternative to the traditional
      lossless compression algorithms, which it may complement, the two being serviceable
      for different string lengths. We provide a thorough analysis for all binary
      strings of length and for most strings of length by running all Turing machines
      with 5 states and 2 symbols ( with reduction techniques) using the most standard
      formalism of Turing machines, used in for example the Busy Beaver problem. We
      address the question of stability and error estimation, the sensitivity of the
      continued application of the method for wider coverage and better accuracy,
      and provide statistical evidence suggesting robustness. As with compression
      algorithms, this work promises to deliver a range of applications, and to provide
      insight into the question of complexity calculation of finite (and short) strings.

      as individual synapse\u2010like devices demonstrate the ability to process information

      complex networks of coupled atomic switches exhibit emergent criticality similar
      in nature to previously reported electrical activity of biological brains and
      neuron assemblies. Rapid fluctuations in electrical conductance display metastability
      and power law scaling of temporal correlation lengths that are attributed to
      dynamic reorganization of the interconnected electro\u2010ionic network resulting
      from induced non\u2010equilibrium thermodynamic instabilities. These collective

      "In his pioneering work, Alan Turing showed that de novo pattern formation is
      possible if two substances interact that differ in their diffusion range. Since
      then, we have shown that pattern formation is possible if, and only if, a self-enhancing
      reaction is coupled with an antagonistic process of longer range. Knowing this
      crucial condition has enabled us to include nonlinear interactions, which are
      required to design molecularly realistic interactions. Different reaction schemes
      and their relation to Turing''s proposal are discussed and compared with more
      recent observations on the molecular\u2013genetic level. The antagonistic reaction
      may be accomplished by an inhibitor that is produced in the activated region
      or by a depletion of a component that is used up during the self-enhancing reaction.
      The autocatalysis may be realized by an inhibition of an inhibition. Activating
      molecules can be processed into molecules that have an inhibiting function;
      patterning of the Wnt pathway is proposed to depend on such a mechanism. Three-component
      systems, as discussed in Turing''s paper, are shown to play a major role in
      the generation of highly dynamic patterns that never reach a stable state.",

      "title": "Microgadgets: Size Does Matter in Turing-Complete Return-Oriented
      Programming", "abstract": "Return-oriented programming (ROP) has gained a lot
      of popularity lately, as an attack against currently implemented defenses in
      modern operating systems. Several kinds of ROP-based attacks and anti-ROP defenses
      have been proposed in recent years. The original attack technique depends on
      the existence of a hand-picked set of byte sequences (called gadgets) in the
      program, while subsequent approaches use complex scanners, which perform semantic
      analysis on the code to locate gadgets. The latter ones are efficient at finding
      gadgets and building an attack, but incur a significant cost in time. \n \nWe
      propose a ROP attack technique, based on a handpicked but flexible and Turing-complete
      set of gadgets. One novelty in this approach is the use of microgadgets, which
      are gadgets restricted to 2 or 3 bytes in length. Our approach splits gadgets
      into several classes of varying sizes (from 1 to more than 800). Only a single
      gadget from each class is required for Turing-completeness. The short length
      of the gadgets, as well as the large size of the classes, increase the likelihood
      of finding all required gadgets. We also describe an efficient scanner which
      locates these gadgets in a given program. We then use this scanner on the /usr/bin
      directories from several Linux distributions, to show that many programs indeed
      contain a Turing-complete set of microgadgets, which attackers can use to perform
      arbitrary computations.", "venue": "Workshop on Offensive Technologies", "year":

      "George Dyson''s fascinating account of the early years of computers: \"Turing''s
      Cathedral\" is the story behind how the PC, ipod, smartphone and almost every
      aspect of modern life came into being. In 1945 a small group of brilliant engineers
      and mathematicians gathered at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
      determined to build a computer that would make Alan Turing''s theory of a ''universal
      machine'' reality. Led by the polymath emigre John von Neumann, they created
      the numerical framework that underpins almost all modern computing - and ensured
      that the world would never be the same again. George Dyson is a historian of
      technology whose interests include the development (and redevelopment) of the
      Aleut kayak. He is the author of \"Baidarka\"; \"Project Orion\"; and \"Darwin
      Among the Machines\". \"Unusual, wonderful, visionary\". (Francis Spufford,
      \"Guardian\"). \"Fascinating...the story Dyson tells is intensely human...a
      gripping account of ideas and invention. Fascinating...the story Dyson tells
      is intensely human...a gripping account of ideas and invention.\" (\"Jenny Uglow\").
      \"Glorious...as much a story of the personalities involved as of the discoveries

      estimator of Shannon''s entropy on a countable alphabet is proposed and analyzed
      against the well-known plug-in estimator. The proposed estimator is developed
      based on Turing''s formula, which recovers distributional characteristics on
      the subset of the alphabet not covered by a size-n sample. The fundamental switch
      in perspective brings about substantial gain in estimation accuracy for every
      distribution with finite entropy. In general, a uniform variance upper bound
      is established for the entire class of distributions with finite entropy that
      decays at a rate of O(ln(n)/n) compared to O([ln(n)]2/n) for the plug-in. In
      a wide range of subclasses, the variance of the proposed estimator converges
      at a rate of O(1/n), and this rate of convergence carries over to the convergence
      rates in mean squared errors in many subclasses. Specifically, for any finite
      alphabet, the proposed estimator has a bias decaying exponentially in n. Several
      new bias-adjusted estimators are also discussed.", "venue": "Neural Computation",

      his crucial contributions to the theory of computation, he studied the question

      Although quantum mechanics implies that events are intrinsically unpredictable,

      to decision-making processes, not freedom. By contrast, the theory of computation

      in a monostable regime and over a large region of parameter space produces Turing
      patterns coexisting with a limit cycle which cannot be discerned from the linear

      parameter, a series of bifurcations leads to period doubling, quasiperiodic,
      and chaotic oscillations without modifying the underlying Turing pattern. A
      Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse route to chaos is identified. We also examine the Turing
      conditions for obtaining a diffusion-driven instability and show that the patterns
      obtained are not necessarily stationary for certain values of the diffusion
      coefficients. These results demonstrate the limitations of the linear analysis

      "For most of its history, mathematics was algorithmic in nature. The geometric
      claims in Euclid\u2019s Elements fall into two distinct categories: \u201cproblems,\u201d
      which assert that a construction can be carried out to meet a given specification,
      and \u201ctheorems,\u201d which assert that some property holds of a particular
      geometric configuration. For example, Proposition 10 of Book I reads \u201cTo
      bisect a given straight line.\u201d Euclid\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d gives the
      construction, and ends with the (Greek equivalent of) quod erat faciendum, or
      Q.E.F., \u201cthat which was to be done.\u201d Proofs of theorems, in contrast,
      end with quod erat demonstrandum, or \u201cthat which was to be shown\u201d;
      but even these typically involve the construction of auxiliary geometric objects
      in order to verify the claim. Similarly, algebra was devoted to discovering
      algorithms for solving equations. This outlook characterized the subject from
      its origins in ancient Egypt and Babylon, through the ninth century work of
      al-Khwarizmi, to the solutions to the cubic and quadratic equations in Cardano\u2019s
      Ars magna of 1545, and to Lagrange\u2019s study of the quintic in his Reflexions
      sur la resolution algebrique des equations of 1770. The theory of probability,
      which was born in an exchange of letters between Blaise Pascal and Pierre de
      Fermat in 1654 and developed further by Christian Huygens and Jakob Bernoulli,

      "title": "Unstable subsystems cause Turing instability", "abstract": "We study
      Turing instabilities in 3-component reaction-di\u00a4usion systems. The existence
      of a complementary pair of stable-unstable subsystems always gives rise to Turing
      instability for suitable diagonal di\u00a4usion matrices. There are two types
      of Turing instability, one called steady instability and the other wave instability.
      To determine which of the two types of instability actually occurs, easily verifiable
      conditions on unstable subsystems are given. A complementary pair of unstableunstable
      subsystems in a stable full system also leads to steady instability. Our results
      give a perspective to the rich variety and complexity of pattern dynamics in
      3-component systems of reaction-di\u00a4usion equations at the onset. 1. Background,
      problem and main result In 1952, Turing [16] proposed a novel idea that two
      chemical substances reacting and di\u00a4using in a homogeneous medium might
      produce a stable spatially inhomogeneous state, out of a uniform steady state
      which is stable under homogeneous perturbations. This statement sounds counter
      intuitive, because di\u00a4usion supposedly acts as a stabilizing (homogenizing)
      e\u00a4ect. Turing, however, clearly demonstrated, via a concrete system of
      two linear reaction-di\u00a4usion equations, that this (mathematical) phenomenon
      certainly is possible. Despite of (or \u2018\u2018Because of \u2019\u2019) its
      counter intuitive nature, this fascinating idea has attracted the attention
      of researchers from diverse areas of science, such as biology, nonlinear physics,
      chemistry, engineering, as well as mathematics, and a huge amount of literature
      on this subject has accumulated, see for example [1, 4, 6, 10] and references
      there. Most studies on Turing instability have been concerned with 2-component
      systems of reaction-di\u00a4usion equations, and the mathematical mechanism
      of Turing instability is well-understood for 2-component systems [1, 4, 6, 10].
      In the original article [16], however, Turing also touched on 3-component systems
      and briefly mentioned to a type of instability associated with a mode which
      is nontrivial both in space and time, as quoted below: \u00a78.7. Oscillatory
      case with a finite wave length (case e). This means that there are genuine travelling
      waves. Since the example to be given 215 Received August 18, 2011; revised January
      5, 2012. involves three morphogens it is not possible to use the formulae of
      Section 6. Instead, one must use the corresponding three morphogen formulae.
      This type of Turing instability never occurs in 2-component systems, as long
      as the di\u00a4usion matrix is diagonal. In recent decades, there have been
      several papers [13, 19, 18, 12, 7] dealing with Turing instability in 3-component
      systems of reaction-di\u00a4usion equations, and each of these investigations
      extends the Turing instability mechanism to 3-component systems. To our best
      knowledge, however, there is no comprehensive mathematical description of what
      the essential feature of Turing instability is in n-component (nb 3) systems.
      The purpose of this article is to clarify the source of Turing instabilities
      and how they appear in 3-component systems of reaction-di\u00a4usion equations.
      In the remaining part of \u00a71, we formulate our problem in precise terms,
      present main results and relate our results to other previous studies. Proofs
      of the main results are given in \u00a72. We apply the main results to several
      concrete examples in \u00a73. Finally, in \u00a74, we display types of stable
      3 3 matrices in which various stability-instability properties of sub-matrices
      coexist, and give a perspective for remaining problems. 1.1. Statement of problem.
      We consider the 3-component system of reaction-di\u00a4usion equations;", "venue":

      o-machine discussed in his PhD thesis can perform all of the usual operations
      of a Turing machine and in addition, when it is in a certain internal state,
      can also query an oracle for an answer to a specific question that dictates
      its further evolution. In his thesis, Turing said ''We shall not go any further
      into the nature of this oracle apart from saying that it cannot be a machine.\u2019
      There is a host of literature discussing the role of the oracle in AI, modeling
      brain, computing, and hypercomputing machines. In this paper, we take a broader
      view of the oracle machine inspired by the genetic computing model of cellular
      organisms and the self-organizing fractal theory. We describe a specific software
      architecture implementation that circumvents the halting and un-decidability
      problems in a process workflow computation to introduce the architectural resiliency
      found in cellular organisms into distributed computing machines. A DIME (Distributed
      Intelligent Computing Element), recently introduced as the building block of
      the DIME computing model, exploits the concepts from Turing\u2019s oracle machine
      and extends them to implement a recursive managed distributed computing network,
      which can be viewed as an interconnected group of such specialized oracle machines,
      referred to as a DIME network. The DIME network architecture provides the architectural
      resiliency through auto-failover; autoscaling; live-migration; and end-to-end
      transaction security assurance in a distributed system. We demonstrate these
      characteristics using prototypes without the complexity introduced by hypervisors,
      virtual machines and other layers of ad-hoc management software in today\u2019s

      We extend the original model proposed by Nakao and Mikhailov [Nat. Phys. 6,

      and predators distributed on a scale-free network of patches. We identify patterns

      |x| \u2212 c. The ''only if'' direction was obtained independently by Joseph
      Miller. This characterization can be extended to the case of time-bounded C-complexity.
      Next we prove some results on lowness. Among other things, we characterize the
      2-random sets as those 1-random sets that are low for Chaitin''s \u2126. Also,
      2-random sets form minimal pairs with 2-generic sets. The r.e. low for \u2126
      sets coincide with the r.e. K-trivial ones. Finally we show that the notions
      of Martin-L\u00f6f randomness, recursive random-ness, and Schnorr randomness
      can be separated in every high degree while the same notions coincide in every
      non-high degree. We make some remarks about hyperimmune-free and PA-complete
      degrees.", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount":

      biology, artificial intelligence, economics and the humanities point to the
      importance of the notion for understanding the world around us. This article
      takes a Turing centenary look at how the interface between the computable world
      and the incomputable formed a central theme in Turing''s work - from the early
      establishment of the standard model of the stored program computer, to the late
      work on emergence of form in nature, and the first approaches to understanding
      and simulating human intelligence. Turing''s thinking was remarkably prescient,
      and his legacy still impacts on much of our work. The incomputable may turn

      "title": "On impact and evaluation in computational creativity: a discussion
      of the Turing Test and an alternative proposal", "abstract": "Computational
      Creativity is the AI subfield in which we study how to build computational models
      of creative thought in science and the arts. From an engineering perspective,
      it is des irable to have concrete measures for assessing the progress made from
      one version of a program to another, or for comparing and contras ting different
      software systems for the same creative task. We de scribe the Turing Test and
      versions of it which have been used in orde r to measure progress in Computational
      Creativity. We show th at the versions proposed thus far lack the important
      aspect of inte rac ion, without which much of the power of the Turing Test is
      lost. We a rgue that the Turing Test is largely inappropriate for the purpos
      es of evaluation in Computational Creativity, since it attempts to ho mogenise
      creativity into a single (human) style, does not take into ac count the importance
      of background and contextual information for a c eative act, encourages superficial,
      uninteresting advances in fro nt-ends, and rewards creativity which adheres
      to a certain style over tha t which creates something which is genuinely novel.
      We further argu e that although there may be some place for Turing-style tests
      for C omputational Creativity at some point in the future, it is curren tly
      untenable to apply any defensible version of the Turing Test. As an alternative
      to Turing-style tests, we introduce two de scriptive models for evaluating creative
      software, the FACE mode l which describes creative acts performed by software
      in terms of tu ples of generative acts, and the IDEA model which describes how
      such creative acts can have an impact upon an ideal audience, given id eal information
      about background knowledge and the software de v lopment process. While these
      models require further study and e l boration, we believe that they can be usefully
      applied to current sys ems as well as guiding further development of creative
      systems. 1 The Turing Test and Computational Creativity The Turing Test (TT),
      in which a computer and human are interr ogated, with the computer considered
      intelligent if the huma n interrogator is unable to distinguish between them,
      is principal ly a philosophical construct proposed by Alan Turing as a way of
      determ ining whether AI has achieved its goal of simulating intelligence [1].
      The TT has provoked much discussion, both historical and contem porary, however
      this has principally been within the philosophy of A I: most AI researchers
      see it as a distraction from their goals, enco uraging a mere trickery of intelligence
      and ever more sophisticated n atural language front ends, as opposed to focussing
      on real problems. D espite the appeal of the (as yet unawarded) Loebner Prize,
      most subfi elds of AI have developed and follow their own evaluation criteri
      a and methodologies, which have little to do with the TT. 1 School of Informatics,
      University of Edinburgh, UK 2 Department of Computing, Imperial College, London,
      UK Computational Creativity (CC) is a subfield of AI, in which re searchers
      aim to model creative thought by building program s which can produce ideas
      and artefacts which are novel, surprising and valuable, either autonomously
      or in conjunction with humans. Th ere are three main motivations for the study
      of Computational Creat ivity: \u2022 to provide a computational perspective
      on human creativity , in order to help us to understand it (cognitive science);
      \u2022 to enable machines to be creative, in order to enhance our liv es in
      some way (engineering); and \u2022 to produce tools which enhance human creativity
      (aids for cr eative individuals). Creativity can be subdivided into everyday
      problem-solvin g, and the sort of creativity reserved for the truly great, in
      which a problem is solved or an object created that has a major impact on other
      people. These are respectively known as \u201clittle-c\u201d (mundane) a nd
      \u201cbigC\u201d (eminent) creativity [2]. Boden [3] draws a similar disti nction
      in her view of creativity as search within a conceptual space, w h re \u201cexploratory
      creativity\u201d searches within the space, and \u201ctran sformational creativity\u201d
      involves expanding the space by breaking one or m e of the defining characteristics
      and creating a new conceptua l space. Boden sees transformational creativity
      as more surprising , i ce, according to the defining rules of the conceptual
      space, ideas w ithin this space could not have been found before. There are
      two notions of evaluation in CC: ( i) judgements which determine whether an
      idea or artefact is valuable or not (an e ssential criterion for creativity)
      \u2013 these judgements may be made int rnally by whoever produced the idea,
      or externally, by someone else and (ii ) judgements to determine whether a system
      is acting creativ ely or not. In the following discussion, by evaluation, we
      mean the latter judgement. Finding measures of evaluation of CC is an active
      area of research, both influenced by, and influencing, practical a nd theoretical
      aspects of CC. It is a particularly important area, s ince such measures suggest
      ways of defining progress in the field, 3 as well as strongly guiding program
      design. While tests of creativity in humans are important for our understanding
      of creativity, they do n ot usually causehumans to be creative (creativity training
      programs, which train people to do well at such tests, notwithstanding). Way
      s in which CC is evaluated, on the other hand, will have a deep influence o
      future development of potentially creative programs. Clearl y, different modes
      of evaluation will be appropriate for the different mo tivations listed above.
      3 The necessity for good measures of evaluation in CC is somewh at paralleled
      in the psychology of creativity: \u201cCreativity is becoming a p opular topic
      in educational, economic and political circles throughout th e world \u2013
      whether this popularity is just a passing fad or a lasting change in in terest
      in creativity and innovation will probably depend, in large part, on wh ether
      creativity assessment keeps pace with the rest of the field.\u201d [4, p. 64]
      The Turing Test is of particular interest to CC for two reason s. Firstly, unlike
      the general situation in AI, the TT, or varia tions of it, arecurrently being
      used to evaluate candidate programs in CC. T hus, the TT is having a major influence
      on the development of CC. Thi s influence is usually neither noted nor questioned.
      Secondly , there are huge philosophical problems with using a test based on
      imita tion to evaluate competence in an area of thought which is based on or
      iginality. While there are varying definitions of creativity, t he majority
      consider some interpretation of novelty and utility to be es sential criteria.
      For instance, one of the commonalities found by Rothe nberg in a collection
      of international perspectives on creativit y is that \u201ccreativity involves
      thinking that is aimed at producing ideas o r products that are relatively novel\u201d
      [5, p.2], and in CC the combin ation of novelty and usefulness is accepted as
      key (for instance, s ee [6] or [3]). In [4], Plucker and Makel list \u201csimilar,
      overlapping a nd possibly synonymous terms for creativity: imagination, ingenuity,
      innovation, inspiration, inventiveness, muse, novelty, originality, serendipity,
      talent and unique\u201d. The term \u2018imitation\u2019 is simply antipodal
      to many of these terms. In the following sections, we firstly describe and discuss
      so me attempts to evaluate Computational Creativity using the Turi ng Test or
      versions of it ( \u00a72), concluding that these attempts all omit the important
      aspect of interaction, and suggest the sort of directio n that a TT for a creative
      computer art system might follow. We then pres ent a series of arguments that
      the TT is inappropriate for measuring creativity in computers (or humans) in
      \u00a73, and suggest that although there may be some place for Turing-style
      tests for Computational C reativity at some point in the future, it is currently
      untenable and impractical. As an alternative to Turing-style tests, in \u00a74,
      we introduce two descriptive models for evaluating creative software, the F
      ACE model which describes creative acts performed by software in term s of tuples
      of generative acts, and the IDEA model which describes h ow such creative acts
      can have an impact upon an ideal audience, given ideal information about background
      knowledge and the softw are development process. We conclude our discussion
      in \u00a75. 2 Attempts to evaluate Computational Creativity using the Turing
      Test or versions of it There have been several attempts to evaluate Computational
      Cre tivity using the Turing Test or versions of it. While these are us f l in
      terms of advancing our understanding of CC, they do not go f ar enough. In this
      section we discuss two such advances ( \u00a72.1 and\u00a72.2), and two further
      suggestions on using human creative behavio ur as a guide for evaluating Computational
      Creativity ( \u00a72.3). We highlight the importance of interaction in \u00a72.4.
      2.1 Discrimination tests Pearce and Wiggins [7] assert for the need for objective,
      fal sifi ble measures of evaluation in cognitive musicology. They propo se the
      \u2018discrimination test\u2019, which is analogous to the TT, in whic subjects
      are played segments of both machine and human-generated mus ic and asked to
      distinguish between them. This might be in a part icular style, such as Bach\u2019s
      music, or might be more general. The y also present one of the most considered
      analyses of whether Turin g-style tests such as the framework they propose might
      be appropriat e for evaluating Computational Creativity [7, \u00a77]. While
      they do not directly refer to Boden\u2019s exploratory creativity [3], instea
      d referring to Boden\u2019s distinction between psychological (P-creativity
      , concerning ideas which are novel with resepct to a particular mind) and h
      istorical creativity (H-creativity, concerning ideas which are novel with respect
      to the whole of human history ), they do argue that much creative work is carried
      out within a particular style. They cite Garnham\u2019s response ", "venue":

      "This article defends a modest version of the Physical Church-Turing thesis
      (CT). Following an established recent trend, I distinguish between what I call
      Mathematical CT\u2014the thesis supported by the original arguments for CT\u2014
      and Physical CT. I then distinguish between bold formulations of Physical CT,
      according to which any physical process\u2014anything doable by a physical system\u2014is
      computable by a Turing machine, and modest formulations, according to which
      any function that is computable by a physical system is computable by a Turing
      machine. I argue that Bold Physical CT is not relevant to the epistemological
      concerns that motivate CT and hence not suitable as a physical analog of Mathematical
      CT. The correct physical analog of Mathematical CT is Modest Physical CT. I
      propose to explicate the notion of physical computability in terms of a usability
      constraint, according to which for a process to count as relevant to Physical
      CT, it must be usable by a finite observer to obtain the desired values of a
      function. Finally, I suggest that proposed counterexamples to Physical CT are
      still far from falsifying it because they have not been shown to satisfy the
      usability constraint. 1\u2003The Mathematical Church\u2013Turing Thesis 2\u2003A

      of the most studied nonlinear mechanisms that generate spatially periodic structures
      autonomous. On the basis of many mathematical studies using computer simulations,
      it is assumed that animal skin patterns are the most typical examples of the
      Turing pattern (stationary periodic pattern produced by the reaction\u2013diffusion
      system). However, the mechanism underlying pattern formation remains unknown
      because the molecular or cellular basis of the phenomenon has yet to be identified.
      In this study, we identified the interaction network between the pigment cells
      of zebrafish, and showed that this interaction network possesses the properties
      necessary to form the Turing pattern. When the pigment cells in a restricted
      region were killed with laser treatment, new pigment cells developed to regenerate
      the striped pattern. We also found that the development and survival of the
      cells were influenced by the positioning of the surrounding cells. When melanophores
      and xanthophores were located at adjacent positions, these cells excluded one
      another. However, melanophores required a mass of xanthophores distributed in
      a more distant region for both differentiation and survival. Interestingly,
      the local effect of these cells is opposite to that of their effects long range.
      This relationship satisfies the necessary conditions required for stable pattern
      formation in the reaction\u2013diffusion model. Simulation calculations for
      the deduced network generated wild-type pigment patterns as well as other mutant
      patterns. Our findings here allow further investigation of Turing pattern formation

      "title": "The chemical basis of morphogenesis", "abstract": "It is suggested
      that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and
      diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of
      morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous,
      may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous
      equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion
      systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells,
      a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation
      is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are
      six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting
      form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account,
      for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves. A system
      of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears
      to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives
      rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary
      waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis.The purpose
      of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote
      may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory
      does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known
      physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding
      of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some
      elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all
      of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be
      found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.",

      the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language
      model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models
      are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling
      language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training
      over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters
      on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model
      size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling
      of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test
      this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that
      uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4$\\times$
      more more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B),
      GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range
      of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially
      less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream
      usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy
      of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher.",

      "abstract": "The Turing machine is one of the simple abstract computational
      devices that can be used to investigate the limits of computability. In this
      paper, they are considered from several points of view that emphasize the importance
      and the relativity of mathematical languages used to describe the Turing machines.
      A deep investigation is performed on the interrelations between mechanical computations
      and their mathematical descriptions emerging when a human (the researcher) starts
      to describe a Turing machine (the object of the study) by different mathematical
      languages (the instruments of investigation). Together with traditional mathematical
      languages using such concepts as \u2018enumerable sets\u2019 and \u2018continuum\u2019
      a new computational methodology allowing one to measure the number of elements
      of different infinite sets is used in this paper. It is shown how mathematical
      languages used to describe the machines limit our possibilities to observe them.
      In particular, notions of observable deterministic and non-deterministic Turing
      machines are introduced and conditions ensuring that the latter can be simulated
      by the former are established. \n \nThe authors thank the anonymous reviewers

      examples that involve exploratory creativity.Findings \u2013 The TT for computer

      \u2013 Raises the problem concerning the concept of creativity which is closely
      linked in most people''s minds with the concept of art. There may be no such
      thing as computer art because there is no such thing as computer creativity.

      can form sustained stationary patterns (Turing patterns) in solution as the
      result of the movement of a diffusible species and the formation of negative
      feedback loops\u2014the chlorite-iodide\u2013malonic acid reaction and the ferrocyanide-iodate-sulfite
      reaction. Horv\u00e1th et al. (p. 772) set out to find other examples based
      on three criteria\u2014that the reaction can develop spatial bistability, that
      independent control of the negative feedback reaction can be achieved, and the
      activating and inhibiting processes can be decoupled by slowing down the diffusing
      species with a complexing agent. The thiourea-iodate-sulfite (TuIS) reaction
      could be developed into a system that produced different stationary patterns,
      including stripes and hexagonal arrays of spots. Thus, such Turing pattern\u2013generating
      reactions are not necessarily uncommon. Three design criteria were used to create
      sustained stationary patterns in the thiourea-iodate-sulfite reaction system.
      Chemical reaction-diffusion patterns often serve as prototypes for pattern formation
      in living systems, but only two isothermal single-phase reaction systems have
      produced sustained stationary reaction-diffusion patterns so far. We designed
      an experimental method to search for additional systems on the basis of three
      steps: (i) generate spatial bistability by operating autoactivated reactions
      in open spatial reactors; (ii) use an independent negative-feedback species
      to produce spatiotemporal oscillations; and (iii) induce a space-scale separation
      of the activatory and inhibitory processes with a low-mobility complexing agent.
      We successfully applied this method to a hydrogen-ion autoactivated reaction,
      the thiourea-iodate-sulfite (TuIS) reaction, and noticeably produced stationary
      hexagonal arrays of spots and parallel stripes of pH patterns attributed to
      a Turing bifurcation. This method could be extended to biochemical reactions.",

      basic mappings defined in it. Two normalization methods of flow diagrams are
      given. The first has |hree base diagrams; the second, only two. In the second
      part of the paper, the second method is applied to ''lhe theory of Turing machines.
      With every Turing maching provided with a two-way half-tape, ihere is associated
      a similar machine, doing essentially ''lhe same job, but working on a tape obtained
      from the first one by interspersing alternate blank squares. The new machine
      belongs to the family, elsewhere introduced, generated by composition and iteration
      from the two machines X and R. That family is a proper subfamily of the whole

      to generating music have been explored in the medium of software for over fifty
      years. Occasionally, researchers have attempted to evaluate the success of these
      generative music systems by measuring the perceived quality or style conformity
      of isolated musical outputs. These tests are often conducted in the form of
      comparisons between computer-aided output and non-computer-aided output. The
      model of the Turing Test (TT), Alan Turing''s proposed \"Imitation Game\" (Turing
      1950), has been submitted and employed as a framework for these comparisons.
      In this context, it is assumed that if machine output sounds like, or is preferred
      to, human output, the machine has succeeded. The nature of this success is rarely
      questioned, and is often interpreted as evidence of a successful generative
      music system. Such listener surveys, within necessary statistical and psychological
      constraints, may be pooled to gauge common responses to and interpretations
      of music\u2014yet these surveys are not TTs. This article argues that Turing''s
      well-known proposal cannot be applied to executing and evaluating listener surveys.",
