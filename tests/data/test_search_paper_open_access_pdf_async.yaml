      "abstract": "Abstract In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a test of whether a machine
      was intelligent: could a machine imitate a human so well that its answers to
      questions were indistinguishable from a human''s? Ever since, creating intelligence
      that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of
      thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like
      artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure,
      and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our own minds. But not
      all types of AI are human-like-in fact, many of the most powerful systems are
      very different from humans-and an excessive focus on developing and deploying
      HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human
      labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly
      dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused
      on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to
      insist on a share of the value created. What is more, augmentation creates new
      capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value
      than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial,
      there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation
      among technologists, business executives, and policy-makers.", "venue": "Daedalus",

      Large language models (LLMs) have been transformative. They are pretrained foundational
      models that are self-supervised and can be adapted with fine-tuning to a wide
      range of natural language tasks, each of which previously would have required
      a separate network model. This is one step closer to the extraordinary versatility
      of human language. GPT-3 and, more recently, LaMDA, both of them LLMs, can carry
      on dialogs with humans on many topics after minimal priming with a few examples.
      However, there has been a wide range of reactions and debate on whether these
      LLMs understand what they are saying or exhibit signs of intelligence. This
      high variance is exhibited in three interviews with LLMs reaching wildly different
      conclusions. A new possibility was uncovered that could explain this divergence.
      What appears to be intelligence in LLMs may in fact be a mirror that reflects
      the intelligence of the interviewer, a remarkable twist that could be considered
      a reverse Turing test. If so, then by studying interviews, we may be learning
      more about the intelligence and beliefs of the interviewer than the intelligence
      of the LLMs. As LLMs become more capable, they may transform the way we interact
      with machines and how they interact with each other. Increasingly, LLMs are
      being coupled with sensorimotor devices. LLMs can talk the talk, but can they
      walk the walk? A road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined
      with seven major improvements inspired by brain systems and how LLMs could in
      turn be used to uncover new insights into brain function.", "venue": "Neural

      models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts. While
      there are many legitimate applications of such models, there is also a rising

      environment with datasets and tasks to systematically study the so-called\"Turing
      Test\"problem for neural text generation methods. In this work, we present the
      TuringBench benchmark environment, which is comprised of (1) a dataset with
      200K human- or machine-generated samples across 20 labels {Human, GPT-1, GPT-2_small,

      PPLM_distil, PPLM_gpt2}, (2) two benchmark tasks -- i.e., Turing Test (TT) and
      Authorship Attribution (AA), and (3) a website with leaderboards. Our preliminary
      experimental results using TuringBench show that FAIR_wmt20 and GPT-3 are the
      current winners, among all language models tested, in generating the most human-like
      indistinguishable texts with the lowest F1 score by five state-of-the-art TT
      detection models. The TuringBench is available at: https://turingbench.ist.psu.edu/",

      "abstract": "Turing structures at the nanoscale Turing structures arise when
      imbalances in diffusion rates make a stable steady-state system sensitive to
      small heterogeneous perturbations. For example, Turing patterns occur in chemical
      reactions when a fast-moving inhibitor controls the motion of a slower-moving
      activator. Tan et al. grew polyamide membranes by using interfacial polymerization,
      where the reactions occur at the interface between oil and water layers. The
      addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the aqueous phase reduced the diffusion of
      the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands,
      which prove to be better for water desalination. Science, this issue p. 518
      Turing structures generated via diffusion-driven instabilities make polyamide
      membranes for water desalination. The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental
      importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications
      have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based
      on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for
      water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions
      enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes
      exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound
      line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence
      of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport
      through the membranes is enhanced.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      computing is a non-von Neumann computing paradigm that performs computation
      by emulating the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are extremely energy-efficient
      and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs and GPUs. They
      have the potential to drive critical use cases such as autonomous vehicles,
      edge computing and internet of things in the future. For this reason, they are
      sought to be an indispensable part of the future computing landscape. Neuromorphic
      systems are mainly used for spike-based machine learning applications, although
      there are some non-machine learning applications in graph theory, differential
      equations, and spike-based simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic
      computing might be capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose
      computability of neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this
      work, we prove that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore
      capable of general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic
      computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two synaptic
      parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for computing
      all the \u03bc-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and projection
      functions) and all the \u03bc-recursive operators (i.e., composition, primitive
      recursion and minimization operators). Given that the \u03bc-recursive functions
      and operators are precisely the ones that can be computed using a Turing machine,
      this work establishes the Turing-completeness of neuromorphic computing.", "venue":

      "Importance: Chatbots could play a role in answering patient questions, but
      patients'' ability to distinguish between provider and chatbot responses, and

      To assess the feasibility of using ChatGPT or a similar AI-based chatbot for
      patient-provider communication. Design: Survey in January 2023 Setting: Survey
      Participants: A US representative sample of 400 study participants aged 18 and
      above was recruited on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform for academic studies.
      384 participants filled out the full survey. After removing participants who
      spent less than 3 minutes on the survey, 360 respondents remained. 53.3% of
      respondents analyzed were women; their average age was 45.4. Exposure(s): Ten
      representative non-administrative patient-provider interactions were extracted
      from the EHR. Patients'' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for
      the chatbot to respond using approximately the same word count as the human
      provider''s response. In the survey, each patient''s question was followed by
      a provider- or ChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that five
      responses were provider-generated and five were chatbot-generated. Participants
      were asked, and incentivized financially, to correctly identify the response
      source. Participants were also asked about their trust in chatbots'' functions
      in patient-provider communication, using a Likert scale of 1-5. Main Outcome(s)
      and Measure(s): Main outcome: Proportion of responses correctly classified as
      provider- vs chatbot-generated. Secondary outcomes: Average and standard deviation
      of responses to trust questions. Results: The correct classification of responses
      ranged between 23.4% to 86.7% for different questions. On average, chatbot responses
      were identified correctly 60.0% of the time and provider responses were identified
      correctly 62.3% of the time. On average, responses toward patients'' trust in
      chatbots'' functions were weakly positive (mean Likert score: 3.4), with lower
      trust as the health-related complexity of the task in questions increased. Conclusions
      and Relevance: ChatGPT responses to patient questions were close to indistinguishable
      from provider responses. Laypeople appear to trust the use of chatbots to answer
      lower risk health questions. It is important to continue studying patient-chatbot
      interaction as chatbots move from administrative to more clinical roles in healthcare.",

      unstructured domains is a challenging problem. Unfortunately, existing automatic
      evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements
      of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation
      procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and
      testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to
      this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem.We
      present an evaluation model (ADEM)that learns to predict human-like scores to
      input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that
      the ADEM model\u2019s predictions correlate significantly, and at a level much
      higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both
      the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating
      dialogue mod-els unseen during training, an important step for automatic dialogue

      patterns have been extensively studied in configurations that can be modelled
      by the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Typically, such schemes are implemented experimentally
      by resonant coupling of a continuous wave laser to a Kerr microcavity in order
      to generate highly coherent and robust waves. Here, we study the formation of
      such patterns in a system composed of a microresonator nested in an amplifying
      laser cavity, a scheme recently used to demonstrate laser cavity solitons with
      high optical efficiency and easy repetition rate control. Utilizing this concept,
      we study different regimes of Turing patterns, unveiling their formation dynamics
      and demonstrating their controllability and robustness. By conducting a comprehensive
      modulational instability study with a mean-field model of the system, we explain
      the pattern formation in terms of its evolution from background noise, paving
      the way towards complete self-starting operation. Our theoretical and experimental
      paper provides a clear pathway for repetition rate control of these waves over

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      deep neural networks, the performance advantage of binarized neural networks

      systems", "abstract": "The Turing and Benjamin\u2013Feir instabilities are two
      of the primary instability mechanisms useful for studying the transition from
      homogeneous states to heterogeneous spatial or spatio-temporal states in reaction\u2013diffusion
      systems. We consider the case when the underlying reaction\u2013diffusion system
      is non-autonomous or has a base state which varies in time, as in this case
      standard approaches, which rely on temporal eigenvalues, break down. We are
      able to establish respective criteria for the onset of each instability using
      comparison principles, obtaining inequalities which involve the in general time-dependent
      model parameters and their time derivatives. In the autonomous limit where the
      base state is constant in time, our results exactly recover the respective Turing
      and Benjamin\u2013Feir conditions known in the literature. Our results make
      the Turing and Benjamin\u2013Feir analysis amenable for a wide collection of
      applications, and allow one to better understand instabilities emergent due
      to a variety of non-autonomous mechanisms, including time-varying diffusion
      coefficients, time-varying reaction rates, time-dependent transitions between
      reaction kinetics and base states which change in time (such as heteroclinic
      connections between unique steady states, or limit cycles), to name a few examples.",

      "title": "Stochastic Turing patterns in a synthetic bacterial population", "abstract":
      "Significance In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could
      arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing
      inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing\u2019s conditions are disappointingly
      hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts
      pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered
      bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor
      system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered
      patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively
      with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms,
      driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much
      broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin of biological
      morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our
      understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952,
      Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability
      of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion
      systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing
      activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and
      the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called
      into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator\u2013inhibitor
      birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts
      the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with
      no severe requirement on the ratio of activator\u2013inhibitor diffusion coefficients.
      To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically
      engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules
      form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming
      gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered
      bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale
      much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental
      patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These
      results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity,
      can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings
      provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising
      from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.",

      often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably,
      medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial
      intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals,

      as malignant or benign is still an underlying challenge. To address this challenge,
      radiologists need computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can assist in
      learning discriminative imaging features corresponding to malignant and benign
      nodules. However, learning highly discriminative imaging features is an open
      problem. In this paper, our aim is to learn the most discriminative features
      pertaining to lung nodules by using an adversarial learning methodology. Specifically,
      we propose to use un-supervised learning with Deep Convolutional-Generative
      Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) to generate lung nodule samples realistically.
      We hypothesize that imaging features of lung nodules will be discriminative
      if it is hard to differentiate them (fake) from real (true) nodules. To test
      this hypothesis, we present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order
      to evaluate the quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons
      are performed in discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules.
      This experimental set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated
      nodules, which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining
      highly discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational
      purposes, and (3) generate realistic samples to train deep networks with big

      "abstract": "We provide nationally representative estimates of sexual minority
      representation in STEM fields by studying 142,641 men and women in same-sex
      couples from the 2009\u20132018 American Community Surveys. These data indicate
      that men in same-sex couples are 12 percentage points less likely to have completed
      a bachelor\u2019s degree in a STEM field compared to men in different-sex couples.
      On the other hand, there is no gap observed for women in same-sex couples compared
      to women in different-sex couples. The STEM degree gap between men in same-sex
      and different-sex couples is larger than the STEM degree gap between all white
      and black men but is smaller than the gender gap in STEM degrees. We also document
      a smaller but statistically significant gap in STEM occupations between men
      in same-sex and different-sex couples, and we replicate this finding by comparing
      heterosexual and gay men using independently drawn data from the 2013\u20132018
      National Health Interview Surveys. These differences persist after controlling
      for demographic characteristics, location, and fertility. Finally, we document
      that gay male representation in STEM fields (measured using either degrees or
      occupations) is systematically and positively associated with female representation
      in those same STEM fields.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      but less is known concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous
      media. It is non-trivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent
      spatial heterogeneity from emergent patterning due to nonlinear instability.
      We employ WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
      which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions. We find that the
      structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical trigonometric
      functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of different growth
      rates are localized to different spatial regions. This localization helps explain
      common amplitude modulations observed in simulations of Turing systems in heterogeneous
      settings. We numerically demonstrate this theory, giving an illustrative example
      of the emergent instabilities and the striking complexity arising from spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion systems. Our results give insight both
      into systems driven by exogenous heterogeneity, as well as successive pattern
      forming processes, noting that most scenarios in biology do not involve symmetry
      breaking from homogeneity, but instead consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous
      states. The instability mechanism reported here precisely captures such evolution,

      instability is an archetype-constitute an important class of dynamical processes
      occurring in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. Recently, it has
      been shown that the Turing instability can induce pattern formation in discrete
      media such as complex networks, opening up the intriguing possibility of exploring
      it as a generative mechanism in a plethora of socioeconomic contexts. Yet much
      remains to be understood in terms of the precise connection between network
      topology and its role in inducing the patterns. Here we present a general mathematical
      description of a two-species reaction-diffusion process occurring on different
      flavors of network topology. The dynamical equations are of the predator-prey
      class that, while traditionally used to model species population, has also been
      used to model competition between antagonistic features in social contexts.
      We demonstrate that the Turing instability can be induced in any network topology
      by tuning the diffusion of the competing species or by altering network connectivity.
      The extent to which the emergent patterns reflect topological properties is
      determined by a complex interplay between the diffusion coefficients and the
      localization properties of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We find
      that networks with large degree fluctuations tend to have stable patterns over
      the space of initial perturbations, whereas patterns in more homogenous networks

      Spiking neural P systems with communication on request (SNQ P systems) are a

      neurons. SNQ P systems have previously been proved to be universal (computationally
      equivalent to Turing machines) when two types of spikes are considered. This
      paper studies a simplified version of SNQ P systems, i.e. SNQ P systems with
      one type of spike. It is proved that one type of spike is enough to guarantee
      the Turing universality of SNQ P systems. Theoretical results are shown in the
      cases of the SNQ P system used in both generating and accepting modes. Furthermore,
      the influence of the number of unbounded neurons (the number of spikes in a
      neuron is not bounded) on the computation power of SNQ P systems with one type
      of spike is investigated. It is found that SNQ P systems functioning as number
      generating devices with one type of spike and four unbounded neurons are Turing

      sentiment polarity expressed towards a given opinion target in a sentence. The
      sentiment polarity of the target is not only highly determined by sentiment
      semantic context but also correlated with the concerned opinion target. Existing
      works cannot effectively capture and store the inter-dependence between the

      the dependable correlation of the opinion target to context and concentrate
      on crucial sentiment information. Specifically, ANTM separates the information
      of storage and computation, which extends the capabilities of the controller
      to learn and store sequential features. The read and write operations enable
      ANTM to adaptively keep track of the interactive attention history between memory
      content and controller state. Moreover, we append target entity embeddings into
      both input and output of the controller in order to augment the integration

      We combine techniques from algorithmic information theory and stochastic thermodynamics

      realizing a given TM with a physical process. The first realization is designed
      to be thermodynamically reversible when fed with random input bits. The second
      realization is designed to generate less heat, up to an additive constant, than
      any realization that is computable (i.e., consistent with the physical Church-Turing
      thesis). We consider three different thermodynamic costs: the heat generated
      when the TM is run on each input (which we refer to as the \"heat function\"),
      the minimum heat generated when a TM is run with an input that results in some
      desired output (which we refer to as the \"thermodynamic complexity\" of the
      output, in analogy to the Kolmogorov complexity), and the expected heat on the
      input distribution that minimizes entropy production. For universal TMs, we
      show for both realizations that the thermodynamic complexity of any desired
      output is bounded by a constant (unlike the conventional Kolmogorov complexity),

      In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods
      of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations
      measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according
      to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding.
      We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares
      a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to
      probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition
      to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy
      in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated
      by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a
      story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted
      device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given
      test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides
      the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes
      the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered
      to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s
      answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question.
      Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural
      language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned
      from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the
      answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,
      is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test
      is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions
      that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object,
      through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other
      uniquely instantiated objects.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy

      "title": "Comparative evaluation of autocontouring in clinical practice: A practical
      method using the Turing test", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAutomated techniques for
      estimating the contours of organs and structures in medical images have become
      more widespread and a variety of measures are available for assessing their
      quality. Quantitative measures of geometric agreement, for example, overlap
      with a gold-standard delineation, are popular but may not predict the level
      of clinical acceptance for the contouring method. Therefore, surrogate measures
      that relate more directly to the clinical judgment of contours, and to the way
      they are used in routine workflows, need to be developed. The purpose of this
      study is to propose a method (inspired by the Turing Test) for providing contour
      quality measures that directly draw upon practitioners'' assessments of manual
      and automatic contours. This approach assumes that an inability to distinguish
      automatically produced contours from those of clinical experts would indicate
      that the contours are of sufficient quality for clinical use. In turn, it is
      anticipated that such contours would receive less manual editing prior to being
      accepted for clinical use. In this study, an initial assessment of this approach
      is performed with radiation oncologists and therapists.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEight
      clinical observers were presented with thoracic organ-at-risk contours through
      a web interface and were asked to determine if they were automatically generated
      or manually delineated. The accuracy of the visual determination was assessed,
      and the proportion of contours for which the source was misclassified recorded.
      Contours of six different organs in a clinical workflow were for 20 patient
      cases. The time required to edit autocontours to a clinically acceptable standard
      was also measured, as a gold standard of clinical utility. Established quantitative
      measures of autocontouring performance, such as Dice similarity coefficient
      with respect to the original clinical contour and the misclassification rate
      accessed with the proposed framework, were evaluated as surrogates of the editing
      time measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe misclassification rates for each organ were:
      esophagus 30.0%, heart 22.9%, left lung 51.2%, right lung 58.5%, mediastinum
      envelope 43.9%, and spinal cord 46.8%. The time savings resulting from editing
      the autocontours compared to the standard clinical workflow were 12%, 25%, 43%,
      77%, 46%, and 50%, respectively, for these organs. The median Dice similarity
      coefficients between the clinical contours and the autocontours were 0.46, 0.90,
      0.98, 0.98, 0.94, and 0.86, respectively, for these organs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA
      better correspondence with time saving was observed for the misclassification
      rate than the quantitative contour measures explored. From this, we conclude
      that the inability to accurately judge the source of a contour indicates a reduced
      need for editing and therefore a greater time saving overall. Hence, task-based
      assessments of contouring performance may be considered as an additional way
      of evaluating the clinical utility of autosegmentation methods.", "venue": "Medical

      Vertebrates have a vast array of epithelial appendages, including scales, feathers,
      and hair. The developmental patterning of these diverse structures can be theoretically
      explained by Alan Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion system. However, the role
      of this system in epithelial appendage patterning of early diverging lineages
      (compared to tetrapods), such as the cartilaginous fishes, is poorly understood.
      We investigate patterning of the unique tooth-like skin denticles of sharks,
      which closely relates to their hydrodynamic and protective functions. We demonstrate
      through simulation models that a Turing-like mechanism can explain shark denticle
      patterning and verify this system using gene expression analysis and gene pathway
      inhibition experiments. This mechanism bears remarkable similarity to avian
      feather patterning, suggesting deep homology of the system. We propose that
      a diverse range of vertebrate appendages, from shark denticles to avian feathers
      and mammalian hair, use this ancient and conserved system, with slight genetic
      modulation accounting for broad variations in patterning.", "venue": "Science

      "title": "Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry",
      "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during
      embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular
      mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that
      tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of
      chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously
      arising from specific chemical interactions (such as \u201cTuring-patterns\u201d).
      Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products
      of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories,
      and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively
      influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus
      on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development.
      On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical
      simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of
      the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical
      behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied
      using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis
      to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development.
      On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even
      simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead
      to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that
      the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories
      are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning

      of the Turing Award, which represents the top-level award in the computer science
      field, is a milestone. We study the long-term evolution of the Turing Award
      Collaboration Network, and it can be considered as a microcosm of the computer
      science field from 1974 to 2016. First, scholars tend to publish articles by
      themselves at the early stages, and they began to focus on tight collaboration
      since the late 1980s. Second, compared with the same scale random network, although
      the Turing Award Collaboration Network has small-world properties, it is not
      a scale-free network. The reason may be that the number of collaborators per
      scholar is limited. It is impossible for scholars to connect to others freely
      (preferential attachment) as the scale-free network. Third, to measure how far
      a scholar is from the Turing Award, we propose a metric called the Turing Number
      (TN) and find that the TN decreases gradually over time. Meanwhile, we discover
      the phenomenon that scholars prefer to gather into groups to do research with
      the development of computer science. This article presents a new way to explore

      Yet, in vitro reconstitution showed feather germs appear simultaneously, leading

      a spreading Ectodysplasin A (EDA) wave and Fibroblast Growth Factor 20 (FGF20)-cell

      We study a minimal, stochastic model of developmental patterns in Anabaena that
      includes a nondiffusing activator, two diffusing inhibitor morphogens, demographic
      fluctuations in the number of morphogen molecules, and filament growth. By tracking
      developing filaments, we provide experimental evidence for different spatiotemporal
      roles of the two inhibitors during pattern maintenance and for small molecular
      copy numbers, justifying a stochastic approach. In the deterministic limit,
      the model yields Turing patterns within a region of parameter space that shrinks
      markedly as the inhibitor diffusivities become equal. Transient, noise-driven,
      stochastic Turing patterns are produced outside this region, which can then
      be fixed by downstream genetic commitment pathways, dramatically enhancing the

      "abstract": "Yao''s 1995 publication \u2018Quantum circuit complexity\u2019
      in Proceedings of the 34th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer
      Science, pp. 352\u2013361, proved that quantum Turing machines and quantum circuits
      are polynomially equivalent computational models: t\u2265n steps of a quantum
      Turing machine running on an input of length n can be simulated by a uniformly
      generated family of quantum circuits with size quadratic in t, and a polynomial-time
      uniformly generated family of quantum circuits can be simulated by a quantum
      Turing machine running in polynomial time. We revisit the simulation of quantum
      Turing machines with uniformly generated quantum circuits, which is the more
      challenging of the two simulation tasks, and present a variation on the simulation
      method employed by Yao together with an analysis of it. This analysis reveals
      that the simulation of quantum Turing machines can be performed by quantum circuits
      having depth linear in t, rather than quadratic depth, and can be extended to
      variants of quantum Turing machines, such as ones having multi-dimensional tapes.
      Our analysis is based on an extension of method described by Arright, Nesme
      and Werner in 2011 in Journal of Computer and System Sciences 77, 372\u2013378.

      to Alan Turing, reflects on Turing''s personality in order to better understand

      human attitude and particular scientific method, Turing is able to \u201cimmerse
      himself\u201d into the phenomena on which he works. This peculiar blend justifies
      the epistolary style. Turing makes himself a \u201chuman computer\u201d, he
      lives the dramatic quest for an undetectable imitation of a man, a woman, a
      machine. He makes us see the continuous deformations of a material action/reaction/diffusion
      dynamics of hardware with no software. Each of these investigations opens the
      way to new scientific paths with major consequences for contemporary live and
      for knowledge. The uses and the effects of these investigations will be discussed:
      the passage from classical AI to today''s neural nets, the relevance of non-linearity
      in biological dynamics, but also their abuses, such as the myth of a computational
      world, from a Turing-machine like universe to an encoded homunculus in the DNA.

      "abstract": "Significance Turing proposed that intercellular reaction-diffusion
      of molecules is responsible for morphogenesis. The impact of this paradigm has
      been profound. We exploit an abiological experimental system of emulsion drops
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reactants ideally suited to test Turing\u2019s
      theory. Our experiments verify Turing\u2019s thesis of the chemical basis of
      morphogenesis and reveal a pattern, not previously predicted by theory, which
      we explain by extending Turing\u2019s model to include heterogeneity. Quantitative
      experimental results obtained using this artificial cellular system establish
      the strengths and weaknesses of the Turing model, applicable to biology and
      materials science alike, and pinpoint which directions are required for improvement.
      Alan Turing, in \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d [Turing AM (1952)
      Philos Trans R Soc Lond 237(641):37\u201372], described how, in circular arrays
      of identical biological cells, diffusion can interact with chemical reactions
      to generate up to six periodic spatiotemporal chemical structures. Turing proposed
      that one of these structures, a stationary pattern with a chemically determined
      wavelength, is responsible for differentiation. We quantitatively test Turing\u2019s
      ideas in a cellular chemical system consisting of an emulsion of aqueous droplets
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillatory chemical reactants, dispersed
      in oil, and demonstrate that reaction-diffusion processes lead to chemical differentiation,
      which drives physical morphogenesis in chemical cells. We observe five of the
      six structures predicted by Turing. In 2D hexagonal arrays, a seventh structure
      emerges, incompatible with Turing\u2019s original model, which we explain by
      modifying the theory to include heterogeneity.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      machine and which was the human. The transcripts presented all involve one machine

      driven instability has been hypothesized as a mechanism to drive spatial self-organization
      in biological systems since the seminal work of Turing. Such systems are often
      considered on a growing domain, but traditional theoretical studies have only
      treated the domain size as a bifurcation parameter, neglecting the system non-autonomy.
      More recently, the conditions for a diffusively driven instability on a growing
      domain have been determined under stringent conditions, including slow growth,
      a restriction on the temporal interval over which the prospect of an instability
      can be considered and a neglect of the impact that time evolution has on the
      stability properties of the homogeneous reference state from which heterogeneity
      emerges. Here, we firstly relax this latter assumption and observe that the
      conditions for the Turing instability are much more complex and depend on the
      history of the system in general. We proceed to relax all the above constraints,
      making analytical progress by focusing on specific examples. With faster growth,
      instabilities can grow transiently and decay, making the prediction of a prospective
      Turing instability much more difficult. In addition, arbitrarily high spatial
      frequencies can destabilize, in which case the continuum approximation is predicted
      to break down.", "venue": "Proceedings of the Royal Society A", "year": 2017,

      driven by continuous-wave (cw) lasers, Turing patterns have been studied in
      the formalism of Lugiato-Lefever equation with emphasis on its high coherence
      and exceptional robustness against perturbations. Destabilization of Turing
      pattern and transition to spatio-temporal chaos, however, limits the available
      energy carried in the Turing rolls and prevents further harvest of their high
      coherence and robustness to noise. Here we report a novel scheme to circumvent
      such destabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations,
      and attain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear
      oscillators, achieving a record high power conversion efficiency of 45% and
      an elevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern is
      discretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency
      sideband non-uniformity measured at 7.3x10^-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous
      microwave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution stages
      through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free running Turing roll
      coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is transferred onto a
      plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest power THz coherent generation at
      room-temperature, with 1.1% optical-to-THz power conversion. Its long-term stability
      can be further improved by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching an Allan
      deviation of 6x10^-10 at 100 s, with a simple computer-aided slow feedback control.
      The demonstrated on-chip coherent high-power Turing-THz system is promising

      diversity based on Good-Turing theory.", "abstract": "Estimating the species,
      phylogenetic, and functional diversity of a community is challenging because
      rare species are often undetected, even with intensive sampling. The Good-Turing
      frequency formula, originally developed for cryptography, estimates in an ecological
      context the true frequencies of rare species in a single assemblage based on
      an incomplete sample of individuals. Until now, this formula has never been
      used to estimate undetected species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity.
      Here, we first generalize the Good-Turing formula to incomplete sampling of
      two assemblages. The original formula and its two-assemblage generalization
      provide a novel and unified approach to notation, terminology, and estimation
      of undetected biological diversity. For species richness, the Good-Turing framework
      offers an intuitive way to derive the non-parametric estimators of the undetected
      species richness in a single assemblage, and of the undetected species shared
      between two assemblages. For phylogenetic diversity, the unified approach leads
      to an estimator of the undetected Faith''s phylogenetic diversity (PD, the total
      length of undetected branches of a phylogenetic tree connecting all species),
      as well as a new estimator of undetected PD shared between two phylogenetic
      trees. For functional diversity based on species traits, the unified approach
      yields a new estimator of undetected Walker et\u00a0al.''s functional attribute
      diversity (FAD, the total species-pairwise functional distance) in a single
      assemblage, as well as a new estimator of undetected FAD shared between two
      assemblages. Although some of the resulting estimators have been previously
      published (but derived with traditional mathematical inequalities), all taxonomic,
      phylogenetic, and functional diversity estimators are now derived under the
      same framework. All the derived estimators are theoretically lower bounds of
      the corresponding undetected diversities; our approach reveals the sufficient
      conditions under which the estimators are nearly unbiased, thus offering new
      insights. Simulation results are reported to numerically verify the performance
      of the derived estimators. We illustrate all estimators and assess their sampling
      uncertainty with an empirical dataset for Brazilian rain forest trees. These
      estimators should be widely applicable to many current problems in ecology,
      such as the effects of climate change on spatial and temporal beta diversity
      and the contribution of trait diversity to ecosystem multi-functionality.",

      "abstract": "The mammalian lung develops through branching morphogenesis. Two
      primary forms of branching, which occur in order, in the lung have been identified:
      tip bifurcation and side branching. However, the mechanisms of lung branching
      morphogenesis remain to be explored. In our previous study, a biological mechanism
      was presented for lung branching pattern formation through a branching model.
      Here, we provide a mathematical mechanism underlying the branching patterns.
      By decoupling the branching model, we demonstrated the existence of Turing instability.
      We performed Turing instability analysis to reveal the mathematical mechanism
      of the branching patterns. Our simulation results show that the Turing patterns
      underlying the branching patterns are spot patterns that exhibit high local
      morphogen concentration. The high local morphogen concentration induces the
      growth of branching. Furthermore, we found that the sparse spot patterns underlie
      the tip bifurcation patterns, while the dense spot patterns underlies the side
      branching patterns. The dispersion relation analysis shows that the Turing wavelength
      affects the branching structure. As the wavelength decreases, the spot patterns
      change from sparse to dense, the rate of tip bifurcation decreases and side
      branching eventually occurs instead. In the process of transformation, there
      may exists hybrid branching that mixes tip bifurcation and side branching. Since
      experimental studies have reported that branching mode switching from side branching
      to tip bifurcation in the lung is under genetic control, our simulation results
      suggest that genes control the switch of the branching mode by regulating the
      Turing wavelength. Our results provide a novel insight into and understanding
      of the formation of branching patterns in the lung and other biological systems.",

      equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial
      ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms, of which Turing''s
      model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason, these patterns show
      striking similarities in systems that seem superficially to share nothing in
      common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation on a zebra skin.

      homoserine lactone (AHL) and long-range inhibitor hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) gas.
      Slowing the production rate of the AHL-degrading enzyme, AiiA, generates stable

      signaling parameters determines local robustness and controls the range of unstable
      wavenumbers in the patterning regime. These findings provide a roadmap for optimizing
      spatial patterns of gene expression based on familiar quorum and gas sensitive

      Rado in 1962, an interesting open question has been the smallest value of n
      for which BB(n) is independent of ZFC set theory. Is this n approximately 10,
      or closer to 1,000,000, or is it even larger? In this paper, we show that it
      is at most 7,910 by presenting an explicit description of a 7,910-state Turing
      machine Z with 1 tape and a 2-symbol alphabet that cannot be proved to run forever
      in ZFC (even though it presumably does), assuming ZFC is consistent. The machine
      is based on the work of Harvey Friedman on independent statements involving
      order-invariant graphs. In doing so, we give the first known upper bound on
      the highest provable Busy Beaver number in ZFC. To create Z, we develop and
      use a higher-level language, Laconic, which is much more convenient than direct
      state manipulation. We also use Laconic to design two Turing machines, G and

      the Turing test is a well-known method for evaluating machine intelligence,
      it has a number of drawbacks that make it problematic as a rigorous and practical
      test for assessing progress in general-purpose AI. For example, the Turing test
      is deception based, subjectively evaluated, and narrowly focused on language
      use. We suggest that a test would benefit from including the following requirements:
      focus on rational behavior, test several dimensions of intelligence, automate
      as much as possible, score as objectively as possible, and allow incremental
      progress to be measured. In this article we propose a methodology for designing
      a test that consists of a series of events, analogous to the Olympic Decathlon,
      which complies with these requirements. The approach, which we call the I-athlon,
      is intended to ultimately enable the community to evaluate progress towards

      attitude toward the notion of simplicity as it figures within the notion of
      logical analysis. Next, a reconstruction of his later remarks on Lebensformen
      is offered which factors in his reading of Alan Turing\u2019s \u201cOn computable
      numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem \u201c (1936/7), as
      well as his discussions with Turing 1937-1939. An interpretation of the five
      occurrences of Lebensform in the PI is then given in terms of a logical \u201cregression\u201d
      to Lebensform as a fundamental notion. This regression characterizes Wittgenstein\u2019s
      mature answer to the question, \u201cWhat is the nature of the logical?\u201d",

      "abstract": "Significance Corneal surfaces of some insects are coated with nipple-like
      nanostructures reducing the light reflection. Here we provide an extensive analysis
      of corneae across insect groups. Using atomic force microscopy, we discover
      a striking diversity of corneal nanocoatings, omnipresent in arthropods. These
      fascinating bionanostructures replicate the complete set of the Turing patterns\u2014shapes
      resulting from the reaction\u2212diffusion modeling underlying many examples
      of patterning in biological and physicochemical systems. Our work, verging on
      the interface of nanotechnology and zoology, evolution and biophysics, and ecology
      and genetics, sheds light on the molecular origin and evolutionary diversification
      of a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures. It also describes,
      to our knowledge, the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.
      Nipple-like nanostructures covering the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies,
      and Drosophila have been studied by electron and atomic force microscopy, and
      their antireflective properties have been described. In contrast, corneal nanostructures
      of the majority of other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined
      by methods that did not allow precise morphological characterization. Here we
      provide a comprehensive analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing
      a rich diversity of insect corneal nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are categorized
      into four major morphological patterns and various transitions between them,
      many, to our knowledge, never described before. Remarkably, this unexpectedly
      diverse range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing
      patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled by
      Alan Turing in his famous reaction\u2212diffusion system. These findings reveal
      a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures and shed light on their
      molecular origin and evolutionary diversification. They may also be the first-ever

      have been focused on analyzing the effect of small delays on the pattern formation

      on the formation of Turing patterns of reaction-diffusion equations. First,
      for a delay system in a general form, we propose a technique calculating the
      critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs. Then
      we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern formation
      of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find that when
      the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular patterns,
      which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large delay we find
      spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find that the critical
      delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying capacity to half saturation

      the conventional \"plug-in\" estimator Pi (sample relative abundance) of the
      true relative abundance pi of species i. Because most biodiversity samples are
      incomplete, the plug-in estimators are applied only to the subset of species
      that are detected in the sample. Using the concept of sample coverage and its
      generalization, we propose a new statistical framework to estimate the complete
      RAD by separately adjusting the sample relative abundances for the set of species
      detected in the sample and estimating the relative abundances for the set of
      species undetected in the sample but inferred to be present in the assemblage.
      We first show that P, is a positively biased estimator of pi for species detected
      in the sample, and that the degree of bias increases with increasing relative
      rarity of each species. We next derive a method to adjust the sample relative
      abundance to reduce the positive bias inherent in j. The adjustment method provides
      a nonparametric resolution to the longstanding challenge of characterizing the
      relationship between the true relative abundance in the entire assemblage and
      the observed relative abundance in a sample. Finally, we propose a method to
      estimate the true relative abundances of the undetected species based on a lower
      bound of the number of undetected species. We then combine the adjusted RAD
      for the detected species and the estimated RAD for the undetected species to
      obtain the complete RAD estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed
      RAD curve can unveil the true RAD and is more accurate than the empirical RAD.
      We also extend our method to incidence data. Our formulas and estimators are
      illustrated using empirical data sets from surveys of forest spiders (for abundance
      data) and soil ciliates (for incidence data). The proposed RAD estimator is
      also applicable to estimating various diversity measures and should be widely
      useful to analyses of biodiversity and community structure.", "venue": "Ecology",

      "abstract": "It is hard to bridge the gap between mathematical formulations
      and biological implementations of Turing patterns, yet this is necessary for
      both understanding and engineering these networks with synthetic biology approaches.
      Here, we model a reaction\u2013diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable
      regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology
      study in mammalian cells.1 The model employs a single promoter to express both
      the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large regions
      of parameter space, using biologically interpretable Hill function reactions.
      We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing biologically
      tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of successful patterning.
      We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time evolution by manipulating
      the values for production and degradation relationships. More importantly, our
      analysis predicts that steep dose\u2013response functions arising from cooperativity
      are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness increases parameter space
      and even reduces the requirement for differential diffusion between activator
      and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some of the limitations of linear scenarios
      for reaction\u2013diffusion systems and will help to guide projects to engineer
      synthetic Turing patterns.", "venue": "ACS Synthetic Biology", "year": 2014,
