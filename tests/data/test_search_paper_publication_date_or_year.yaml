      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Iterative joints are a hallmark of the tetrapod limb,
      and their positioning is a key step during limb development. Although the molecular
      regulation of joint formation is well studied, it remains unclear what controls
      the location, number and orientation (i.e. the pattern) of joints within each
      digit. Here, we propose the dot-stripe mechanism for joint patterning, comprising
      two coupled Turing systems inspired by published gene expression patterns. Our
      model can explain normal joint morphology in wild-type limbs, hyperphalangy
      in cetacean flippers, mutant phenotypes with misoriented joints and suggests
      a reinterpretation of the polydactylous Ichthyosaur fins as a polygonal joint
      lattice. By formulating a generic dot-stripe model, describing joint patterns
      rather than molecular joint markers, we demonstrate that the insights from the
      model should apply regardless of the biological specifics of the underlying
      mechanism, thus providing a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning
      in the tetrapod limb. Summary: A dot-stripe Turing mechanism can reproduce a
      wide diversity of joint patterns observed in the tetrapod lineage, providing
      a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning in the tetrapod limb.",

      Evaluation on Turing Machines", "abstract": "Modern communication systems need
      to satisfy pre-specified requirements on spectral efficiency and security. Physical
      layer security is a concept that unifies both and connects them with entropic
      quantities. In this paper, a framework based on Turing machines is developed
      to address the question of deciding whether or not a communication system meets
      these requirements. It is known that the class of Turing solvable problems coincides
      with the class of algorithmically solvable problems so that this framework provides
      the theoretical basis for effective verification of such performance requirements.
      A key issue here is to decide whether or not the performance functions, i.e.,
      capacities, of relevant communication scenarios, particularly those with secrecy
      requirements and active adversaries, are Turing computable. This is a necessary
      condition for the corresponding communication protocols to be effectively verifiable.
      Within this framework, it is then shown that for certain scenarios including
      the wiretap channel the corresponding capacities are Turing computable. Next,
      a general necessary condition on the performance function for Turing computability
      is established. With this, it is shown that for certain scenarios, including
      the wiretap channel with an active jammer, the performance functions are not
      computable when deterministic codes are used. As a consequence, such performance
      functions are also not computable on all other computer architectures such as
      the von Neumann-architecture or the register machines.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions

      that generate symbolic sequences with algorithmic nature may differ in statistical
      complexity because they create structures that follow algorithmic schemes, rather
      than generating symbols from a probabilistic function assuming independence.
      In the case of Turing machines, this means that machines with the same algorithmic
      complexity can create tapes with different statistical complexity. In this paper,
      we use a compression-based approach to measure global and local statistical
      complexity of specific Turing machine tapes with the same number of states and
      alphabet. Both measures are estimated using the best-order Markov model. For
      the global measure, we use the Normalized Compression (NC), while, for the local
      measures, we define and use normal and dynamic complexity profiles to quantify
      and localize lower and higher regions of statistical complexity. We assessed
      the validity of our methodology on synthetic and real genomic data showing that
      it is tolerant to increasing rates of editions and block permutations. Regarding
      the analysis of the tapes, we localize patterns of higher statistical complexity
      in two regions, for a different number of machine states. We show that these
      patterns are generated by a decrease of the tape\u2019s amplitude, given the
      setting of small rule cycles. Additionally, we performed a comparison with a
      measure that uses both algorithmic and statistical approaches (BDM) for analysis
      of the tapes. Naturally, BDM is efficient given the algorithmic nature of the
      tapes. However, for a higher number of states, BDM is progressively approximated
      by our methodology. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm to increase the statistical
      complexity of a Turing machine tape while retaining the same algorithmic complexity.

      via a self-organising Turing network", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Understanding how
      complex organ systems are assembled from simple embryonic tissues is a major
      challenge. Across the animal kingdom a great diversity of visual organs are
      initiated by a \u2018master control gene\u2019 called Pax6, which is both necessary
      and sufficient for eye development. Yet precisely how Pax6 achieves this deeply
      homologous function is poorly understood. Using the chick as a model organism,
      we show that vertebrate Pax6 interacts with a pair of morphogen-coding genes,
      Tgfb2 and Fst, to form a putative Turing network, which we have computationally
      modelled. Computer simulations suggest that this gene network is sufficient
      to spontaneously polarise the developing retina, establishing the first organisational
      axis of the eye and prefiguring its further development. Our findings reveal
      how retinal self-organisation may be initiated independently of the highly ordered
      tissue interactions that help to assemble the eye in vivo. These results help
      to explain how stem cell aggregates spontaneously self-organise into functional
      eye-cups in vitro. We anticipate these findings will help to underpin retinal
      organoid technology, which holds much promise as a platform for disease modelling,
      drug development and regenerative therapies. Highlighted Article: Pax6 can induce
      ectopic eye development in vivo, while retinal organoids can self-organise in
      vitro. We identify a Pax6 Turing network that could explain both phenomena.",

      We investigate the linearized stability of a constant steady state and provide
      conditions under which a Turing type instability takes place, namely, the constant
      state is stable against spatially uniform perturbations on the sphere for all
      choices of diffusion rates, while unstable against nonuniform perturbations
      on the sphere as the diffusion coefficient of the equation on the sphere becomes

      was trained using the forward-backward algorithm also known as Baum Welch algorithm.
      The training process was exhausted by a hundreds of iterations through recursion

      states to predict the next word, and from the previous predicted word, it will
      generate another word, then another word until it reaches the desire word length
      that was set in the program. Afterwards, the model was evaluated using several
      kinds of readability metrics index which measure the reading difficulty and
      comprehensiveness of the generated poem. Then, we performed a Turing Test, which
      participated by 75 college students, who are well versed in poetry. They determined
      if the generated poems was created by a human or a machine. Based from the evaluation
      results, the highest readability score index of the generated short poem is
      in the grade 16th level. While 69.2% of the participants in the Turing Test,

      in which we show the difference compared with system without nonlocal terms

      spatiotemporal phenomena, such as the spatial homogeneous periodic orbit, a
      pair of stable spatial inhomogeneous steady states and a pair of stable spatial
      inhomogeneous periodic orbits, is rigorously proved by analyzing the amplitude

      naturally consider encodings of DTMs, and this will be the first order of business
      for the lecture. The very notion of an encoding scheme for DTMs allows us to
      obtain our first example of a language that is not semidecidable (and is therefore
      not decidable). Through the non-semidecidability of this language, many other
      languages can be shown to be either undecidable or non-semidecidable. We will
      see two simple examples in this lecture and more in the lecture following this

      computation thereby appears as instituting a new stage in the long history of

      and the further study of the emergence of biological forms. Hence the three

      and natural and social dynamics ; morphogenesis in theoretical biology. The

      the non-predictive, the logico-arithmetic of the discrete and the geometry of

      width change), dislocation zipping and unzipping (with velocities measured),

      by reaction diffusion equations, but the terms required in a Landau-Ginzburg
      approach differ, with for example complex coefficients required for spiral patterns
      and real coefficients for chevron patterns. There is a close analogy between
      spiral domains and Zhabotinskii-Belousov patterns, and between bull\u2019s eye
      circular patters and Rayleigh -Bernard instabilities or Taylor-Couette instabilities
      with rotating inner cylinders, but not with each other. The evolution of these
      patterns with increasing strain (e.g., wrinkling/folding or folding/period-doubling

      Adversarial Learning", "abstract": "Long after Turing\u2019s seminal Reaction-Diffusion
      (RD) model, the elegance of his fundamental equations alleviated much of the
      skepticism surrounding pattern formation. Though Turing model is a simplification
      and an idealization, it is one of the best-known theoretical models to explain
      patterns as a reminiscent of those observed in nature. Over the years, concerted
      efforts have been made to align theoretical models to explain patterns in real
      systems. The apparent difficulty in identifying the specific dynamics of the
      RD system makes the problem particularly challenging. Interestingly, we observe
      Turing-like patterns in a system of neurons with adversarial interaction. In
      this study, we establish the involvement of Turing instability to create such
      patterns. By theoretical justification, we present a pseudo-reaction-diffusion
      model to explain the mechanism that may underlie this phenomenon. While supervised
      learning attains homogeneous equilibrium, the introduction of an adversary helps
      break this homogeneity to create nonhomogeneous patterns at equilibrium. In
      addition, different from sole supervision, we show that the solutions obtained
      under adversarial interaction are not limited to a tiny subspace around initialization.",

      of the eigenpolynomial, we derive the existence and stability of the positive

      form and center manifold reduction. The results show that the equilibrium undergoes
      a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. If the diffusion coefficients of the two species
      are sufficiently different, the stable equilibrium and the limit cycle will
      occur Turing instability, respectively. Moreover, we perform the numerical simulations

      Turing sharply distinguishes the imitation from the modeling of a phenomenon.
      The latter aims to grasp the causal structure of the phenomenon studied. However,
      in biology, there is no well-established theoretical framework for modeling
      practices. We start from the link between the living and thermodynamics, especially
      the second principle. This discussion will lead us to the theoretical and epistemological
      challenges in the mathematical understanding of living beings. In particular,
      the historicity of living phenomena is a difficulty rarely taken into account
      in this field. We believe that the historicity of living phenomena requires
      a complete reversal of the epistemology of physics in order to understand living

      focuses on whether or not a machine exists that has passed the Turing Test.
      Should it be determined that a machine has indeed passed this test, it is important
      to discuss what the ethical implications of this accomplishment entail. Turing\u2019s

      He next played a pivotal role in the Second World War, designing the machines
      which cracked the German military codes, enabling the Allies to defeat the Nazis
      in several crucial battles. And in the late 1940''s he turned his attention
      to artificial intelligence and proposed a challenge, now called the Turing test,
      which is still important to the field today. His contribution to mathematical
      biology is less famous, but was no less profound. He published just one paper
      (1952), but it triggered a whole new field of mathematical enquiry into pattern
      formation. He discovered that a system with just 2 molecules could, at least

      "Abstract Pattern formation in clouds is a well-known feature, which can be
      observed almost every day. However, the guiding processes for structure formation
      are mostly unknown, and also theoretical investigations of cloud patterns are
      quite rare. From many scientific disciplines the occurrence of patterns in non-equilibrium
      systems due to Turing instabilities is known, i.e. unstable modes grow and form
      spatial structures. In this study we investigate a generic cloud model for the
      possibility of Turing instabilities. For this purpose, the model is extended
      by diffusion terms. We can show that for some cloud models, i.e special cases
      of the generic model, no Turing instabilities are possible. However, we also
      present a general class of cloud models, where Turing instabilities can occur.
      A key requisite is the occurrence of (weakly) nonlinear terms for accretion.
      Using numerical simulations for a special case of the general class of cloud
      models, we show spatial patterns of clouds in one and two spatial dimensions.
      From the numerical simulations we can see that the competition between collision
      terms and sedimentation is an important issue for the existence of pattern formation.",

      "abstract": "espanolEste articulo analiza la figura del hacker en la novela
      El delirio de Turing, en su capacidad para responder a los problemas derivados
      de la globalizacion y al neoliberalismo. El objetivo es demostrar que, si la
      representacion del hacker cuestiona la politica latinoamericana, es desde una
      optica romantica que exagera sus capacidades y lo convierte en una suerte de
      \u00abtecnodivinidad\u00bb. En consecuencia, se busca responder a dos cuestiones:
      la primera, por que y como un texto literario puede responder a un determinado
      panorama politico; la segunda, que papel desempena exactamente el hacker como
      figura articuladora de dicha respuesta. El articulo se divide en cuatro partes:
      introduccion, dos apartados, y conclusiones. En la introduccion, se justifica
      la pertinencia del objeto de estudio y se senala la hipotesis de partida: la
      contestacion a las politicas neoliberales en Latinoamerica se realiza a traves
      de la sublimacion de las capacidades del hacker. El primer apartado examina
      la capacidad de un texto para constituirse en critica etica y, mas concretamente,
      repasa brevemente los textos utopicos como respuestas literarias, mientras que
      el segundo ahonda en la figura del hacker en la novela de Paz Soldan, y la relaciona
      con postulados teoricos de autores como Domingo Hernandez, Teresa Lopez-Pellisa,
      Tom Moylan, Andrew Brown o Antonio Negri entre otros. Las conclusiones sintetizan
      los logros alcanzados, y apuntan tambien hacia cuestiones como el hecho de que
      la divinizacion del hacker posibilita que se actualice la herramienta narrativa
      del deus ex machina. EnglishThis paper analyses figure of the hacker in El delirio
      de Turing and its capability to respond to the problems linked to globalisation
      and neoliberalism. The purpose is to prove that, if the representation of the
      hacker questions Latin-American politics, it does from a romantic perspective
      that hypertrophies its abilities and turns it into some sort of \u201ctechnodivinity\u201d.
      Therefore, this paper aims to answer two questions: firstly, why and how a literary
      text can respond to a political outlook; secondly, which role does exactly the
      hacker play as an articulating figure of such response. The paper is divided
      into four parts: an introduction, two main sections, and a conclusion. The introduction
      justifies the appropriateness of the object of study and points out the main
      thesis: the opposition to the neoliberal politics in Latin-America is conducted
      through the sublimation of the hacker\u2019s abilities. The first section addresses
      the possibility for a literary text to become an ethical critique and, more
      specifically, goes over utopian texts as literary responses. The second section
      deepens in the figure of the hacker in Paz Soldan\u2019s novel and connects
      it with the theoretical postulates of Domingo Hernandez, Teresa Lopez-Pellisa,
      Tom Moylan, Andrew Brown or Antonio Negri. The conclusion synthesises the mainac
      complishments, and points to issues such as the fact that the divinization of
      the hacker allows for updating the narrative tool of deus ex machina.", "venue":

      ISSN 1456-4491 Mathematical models allow a connection to be made between a pattern
      observed on a macroscopic scale and a hypothetical underlying mechanism. Different
      mechanisms, however, can result in similar patterns. In developmental biology,
      for example, de novo formation of periodic structures similar to purely chemical
      Turing patterns can also be obtained using mechano-chemical models with only
      one diffusing morphogen. In addition, patterns obtained with a fixed model and
      fixed parameter values but with small random perturbations of initial data,
      will significantly differ in shape, while being nominally of the same type.
      With randomised inital data, each model parameter value corresponds to a family
      of patterns rather than a fixed solution. Consequently, standard residual-based
      methods such as least squares cannot be used for parameter estimation. A computational
      approach allowing model calibration to certain patterns will enable not only
      model identification based on experimental pattern data but also comparison
      of different mechanisms by indicating how well a specific model can be fitted
      to the data produced by models based on another mechanism. The aim of the current
      thesis is to present a solution for such problems. The situation is analogous
      to the identification of chaotic systems, as in both cases different initial
      values lead to different solutions which, however, belong to the same family
      of solutions. In this work, a recently developed statistical approach for parameter
      studies of chaotic dynamical systems is modified for application with non-chaotic
      reaction-diffusion systems used as test examples of pattern formation processes.
      A statistical algorithm for parameter identification of reaction-diffusion systems
      is suggested that needs steady-state pattern data only, without knowledge of
      initial values or transient data. Bayesian sampling methods are able to quantify
      \u201call\u201d the model variants that are able to fit given pattern data well
      enough. The developed approach provides a tool for robust discrimination of
      competing mechanisms proposed to explain experimental data. Three classical
      reaction-diffusion models of pattern formation are considered: the FitzHughNagumo
      model, Gierer-Meinhardt system and Brusselator reaction-diffusion system. The
      accuracy of model identification achieved by different amounts of training data
      is quantified by MCMC algorithms. The performance of the method is satisfactory
      in all cases, as verified by Bayesian sampling methods: a large amount of data
      leads to an extremely accurate detection of changes in model parameters, practically
      impossible to detect visually, while a modest amount of training patterns leads
      to the same level of detection as, roughly speaking, might be observed with
      the naked eye. Finally, parameter identification is demonstrated, i.e. convergence
      of the method when starting with initial parameter values far away from the
      correct ones. The identification is done by minimizing of a stochastic cost
      function, solved by an evolutionary optimization algorithm. The construction
      of a posterior parameter distribution by Bayesian sampling methods and running
      the stochastic optimization algorithm requires a large number of model simulations.
      Therefore, the efficiency of the numerical code is crucial for successful application
      of the approach. An optimized parallel algorithm is implemented for the numerical
      solutions of the equations under study. The calculations are done in graphical
      processing units (GPUs) using the Nvidia CUDA parallel computing platform. Significant
      improvement in performance is achieved, making the proposed approach suitable
      for numerical applications.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 202,

      1 via a self-organising Turing network 2 3", "abstract": "9 Understanding how
      complex organ systems are assembled from simple embryonic tissues is 10 a major
      challenge. Across the animal kingdom a great diversity of visual organs are
      initiated 11 by a \u2018master control gene\u2019 called Pax6, which is both
      necessary and sufficient for eye 12 development. Yet precisely how Pax6 achieves
      this deeply homologous function is poorly 13 understood. Using the chick as
      a model organism, we show that vertebrate Pax6 interacts 14 with a pair of morphogen-coding
      genes, Tgfb2 and Fst, to form a putative Turing network, 15 which we have computationally
      modelled. Computer simulations suggest that this gene 16 network is sufficient
      to spontaneously polarise the developing retina, establishing the eye\u2019s
      17 first organisational axis and prefiguring its further development. Our findings
      reveal how 18 retinal self-organisation may be initiated independent of the
      highly ordered tissue interactions 19 that help to assemble the eye in vivo.
      These results help to explain how stem cell aggregates 20 spontaneously self-organise
      into functional eye-cups in vitro. We anticipate these findings will 21 help
      to underpin retinal organoid technology, which holds much promise as a platform

      et al. use inhibitors, modelling and developmental dynamics to define the FGF-Hh-Wnt-BMP
      network driving striped rugal patterning in the oral palate.", "abstract": ":
      Periodic patterning is widespread in development and can be modelled by Reaction-Diffusion
      (RD) processes. However, minimal two-component RD descriptions are vastly simpler
      than the multi-molecular events that actually occur and are often hard to relate
      to real interactions measured experimentally. Addressing these issues, we investigated
      the periodic striped patterning of the rugae (transverse ridges) in the mammalian
      oral palate focusing on multiple previously implicated pathways: FGF, Hh, Wnt
      and BMP. For each, we experimentally identified spatial patterns of activity
      and distinct responses of the system to inhibition. Through numerical and analytical
      approaches, we were able to constrain substantially the number of network structures
      consistent with the data. Determination of the dynamics of pattern appearance
      further revealed its initiation by epithelium-specific FGF and Wnt \"activators\"
      and Hh \"inhibitor\", while BMP and mesenchyme-specific-FGF signalling were
      incorporated once stripes were formed. This further limited the number of possible
      networks. Experimental constraint thus limited the number of possible minimal
      networks to 154, just 0.004% of the number of possible diffusion-driven instability
      networks. Together these studies articulate the principles of multi-morphogen
      RD patterning and demonstrate the utility of perturbation analysis for constraining
      RD systems. using mesenchyme, basal of epithelium first on the phase return

      Spatial patterns revealed by epidemic models governed by reaction-diffusion
      systems can serve as a potential trend indicator of disease spread; thus, they
      have received wide attention. To characterize important features of disease
      spread, there are two important factors that cannot be ignored in the reaction-diffusion
      systems. One is that a susceptible individual has an ability to recognize the
      infected ones and keep away from them. The other is that populations are usually
      organized as networks instead of being continuously distributed in space. Consequently,
      it is essential to study patterns generated by epidemic models with self- and
      cross-diffusion on complex networks. Here, with the help of a linear analysis
      method, we study Turing instability induced by cross-diffusion for a network
      organized SIR epidemic model and explore Turing patterns on several different
      networks. Furthermore, the influences of cross-diffusion and network structure
      on patterns are also investigated.", "venue": "Chaos", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      "Chatbots are software programs that interact with clients using natural languages.
      The motto of the researchers was to know if chatbots can able to fool the clients
      that they were real humans. To develop a chatbot that can pass the Turing test,
      plenty of effort done with the introduction of the ELIZA chatbot in the year
      1966. Various approaches for the development of chatbots and different technologies
      in the creation of chatbots developed because of those efforts. NLTK is a module
      in python which can able to perform Natural Language Processing. It is used
      to analyse the input in the form of speech and generate responses that are similar
      to humans. Nowadays there is a lot of demand for virtual assistants such as
      Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant and Alexa, and speech-based search engines.
      Nowadays Chatbots are gaining massive demand mainly in the business sector for
      automating client service and also for reducing efforts of humans. Chatbots
      typically used for information acquisition in dialogue systems. To perfectly
      imitate a human response, a chatbot should examine the query asked by a client
      correctly and design an appropriate response. In this study we compare and discuss
      the different technologies used in the chatbots and also address the design

      McCarthy later coined the term \u201cAI\u201d to denote the idea of getting
      a computer to do things which, when done by people, are said to involve intelligence.3
      What is new is the digitization of everything from electronic health records
      (EHRs) to genes and microbiomes, which provide the data that AI needs to learn.
      This conversion of images, handwritten notes, and pathology slides into 1\u2019s
      and 0\u2019s allows machines to perform a wide range of tasks, such as detecting
      retinopathy, skin cancer, and lung nodules.4-6 Even though this surge of available
      data exceeds what individuals and teams can realistically manage, computers
      have learned how to process these data to predict outcomes important to our
      patients, including opioid misuse, emergency department visits, and deaths.7-9
      Advances like these led Andy Conrad, the CEO of Google\u2019s life sciences
      subsidiary, to declare that in medicine, \u201cthe most important tool is the
      computer.\u201d10 This revolution has proceeded without AI publications in our
      journals, and our discipline is missing an opportunity to shape its future.
      A PubMed search reveals no AI or machine learning papers in Family Medicine,
      Annals of Family Medicine, or the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine.
      For comparison, AI and machine learning papers number 18, 77, and 8 for Academic
      Medicine, JAMA, and the Journal of General Internal Medicine, respectively.
      While family medicine scholars are engaged in AI research11-13 and others reference
      it,14 family medicine\u2019s voice needs to be amplified. Without our input,
      AI risks following the path of EHRs. When the Health Information Technology
      for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was passed, policy makers believed
      that EHRs would lead to care that was more efficient, effective, and equitable,15
      and EHRs have led to important advances in population health and quality.16
      However, with increasing burnout and decreasing time with patients, many lament
      that EHRs cater to the needs of administrators and EHR vendors rather than physicians
      and patients.17 The usability and interoperability failures underlying these
      complaints are not the result of gaps in technological expertise. Instead, these
      failures emerged, in part, because end-users like ourselves have been insufficiently
      engaged in relevant design, policy, and implementation decisions. As AI spreads,
      our participation is needed to shape this revolution. Without our patient-centered
      orientation, AI has focused on delivering value to shareholders of technology
      companies rather than on problems that affect patients in our practices. Without
      our focus on value, AI has escalated health care costs and is available only
      to those with resources rather than those who would benefit the most. Without
      our focus on personal relationships, AI has further eroded face time by increasing
      the amount of time we spend interacting with computers. Without the breadth
      of our patients, AI has magnified existing biases. For example, as indicated
      in the literature, algorithms used by Artificial Intelligence and Family Medicine:

      line of work trying to characterize BPP (the class of languages that are solvable
      by efficient randomized algorithms) by efficient nonadaptive reductions to the
      set of Kolmogorov-random strings: Buhrman, Fortnow, Kouck\u00fd, and Loff (CCC
      2010 [10]) showed that every language in BPP is reducible to the set of random
      strings via a polynomial-time nonadaptive reduction (irrespective of the choice
      of a universal Turing machine used to define Kolmogorov-random strings). It
      was conjectured by Allender (CiE 2012 [1]) and others that their lower bound
      is tight when a reduction works for every universal Turing machine; i.e., \u201cthe
      only way to make use of random strings by a nonadaptive polynomial-time algorithm
      is to derandomize BPP.\u201d In this paper, we refute this conjecture under
      the plausible assumption that the exponential-time hierarchy does not collapse,
      by showing that the exponential-time hierarchy EXPH can be solved in exponential
      time by nonadaptively asking the oracle whether a string is Kolmogorov-random

      research in pattern formation using reaction-diffusion mostly focused on static
      domains, either for computational simplicity or mathematical tractability. In
      this work, we have explored the expressiveness of combining simple mechanisms
      as a possible explanation for pigmentation pattern formation, where tissue growth
      plays a crucial role. Our motivation is not only to realistically reproduce
      natural patterns but also to get insights into the underlying biological processes.
      Therefore, we present a novel approach to generate realistic animal skin patterns.
      First, we describe the approximation of tissue growth by a series of discrete
      matrix expansion operations. Then, we combine it with an adaptation of Turing\u2019s
      non-linear reaction-diffusion model, which enforces upper and lower bounds to
      the concentrations of the involved chemical reagents. We also propose the addition
      of a single-reagent continuous autocatalytic reaction, called reinforcement,
      to provide a mechanism to maintain an already established pattern during growth.
      By careful adjustment of the parameters and the sequencing of operations, we
      closely match the appearance of a few real species. In particular, we reproduce

      "Let P,Q\u2208Z[x1, . . . , xn] be polynomials that are represented in the usual
      way as linear combinations of power products. The problem of sparse polynomial
      multiplication is to compute the product R=PQ in a way that is as efficient
      as possible in terms of the total bitsize of P, Q, and R (and where we use a
      similar sparse representation for R as for P and Q). For pedagogical reasons,
      we mainly restrict our attention to polynomials with integer coefficients. Together
      with polynomials with rational coefficients, this is indeed the most important
      case for practical implementations inside computer algebra systems. Nevertheless,
      it is not hard to adapt our techniques to coefficients in more general rings
      (some indications to that effect are given in section 5.2). Still for pedagogical
      reasons, we will carry out our complexity analysis in the RAM model [11]. We
      expect our algorithms to adapt to the Turing model [13], but more work will
      be needed to prove this and some of the constant factors might deteriorate.
      For polynomials of modest size, naive algorithms are often most efficient. We
      refer to [3, 6, 10, 19, 28, 32, 33, 37] for implementation techniques that are
      efficient in practice. Various types of faster algorithms have been proposed
      for polynomials with special supports [16, 18, 23, 35]. Asymptotically fast
      methods for polynomials of large sizes usually rely on sparse interpolation.
      The seminal paper by Ben Or and Tiwari [4] triggered the development of many
      fast algorithms for the sparse interpolation of polynomial blackbox functions
      [1, 5, 9, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 34]. In this framework, the unknown polynomial
      R is given through a blackbox functions that can be evaluated at points in suitable
      extensions of the coefficient ring. We refer to [36] for a nice survey on sparse
      interpolation and other algorithms to compute with sparse polynomials. The present
      paper grew out of our recent preprint [21] with Gr\u00e9goire Lecerf on this
      topic; the idea to \u201cexploit colliding terms\u201d in section 6.6 forms

      "title": "A Password-Based Authentication System Based on the CAPTCHA AI Problem",
      "abstract": "Powerful cryptographic systems based on mathematically hard problems
      are utilized to ensure tighter security for data communication purposes. However,
      these traditional cryptographic systems are bound to fail in the ensuing era
      of quantum computing. Thus, Artificial Intelligence (AI) inspired security methods
      are needed to secure communications in the era of quantum computing. This article
      presents a challenge-response password-based authentication system based on
      the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart
      (CAPTCHA) AI hard problem. In this system, a server sends a challenge text to
      a client, then the client generates a random image and blends the challenge
      text inside this random image using his password. Then the client sends the
      generated image to the server. The server extracts the challenge text from the
      sent image using his copy of the client\u2019s password. If the extracted challenge
      text is the same as the sent challenge text, then both the client\u2019s and
      the server\u2019s copies of the password match and the client is authenticated.
      The efficiency of the proposed system is analyzed and the outcomes prove that
      the proposed system is efficient in terms of time and space. Also, a security
      investigation of the proposed system is employed, and the results prove that
      the system is probabilistic and very sensitive to changes in its parameters.
      It does not leak any statistical information about the client\u2019s password
      and the generated images cannot be distinguished from random images. In addition,
      the security of the proposed system is analyzed against two possible attacks;
      the brute force attack and the replay attack and the results prove that the
      proposed system is immune to these attacks. Finally, the proposed system is
      ensured to be indistinguishably secure against an adaptive chosen-challenge
      text attack (IND-ACCTA), based on the CAPTCHA AI hard problem when the hash

      system with Holling type II functional response subject to Neumann boundary
      conditions. Some new sufficient conditions were analytically established to
      ensure that this system has globally asymptotically stable equilibria and Hopf
      bifurcation surrounding interior equilibrium. In the analysis of Hopf bifurcation,
      based on the phenomenon of Turing instability and well-done conditions, the
      system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and an example incorporating with numerical

      derived a useful algorithm for determining direction of Hopf bifurcation and
      stability of bifurcating periodic solutions correspond to j \u2260 0 and j =

      dimension when the learning prior is derived from a complexity measure (Kolmogorov
      complexity and minimal number of states respectively) and analyse the sampling
      distributions that lead to finite expected teaching dimensions. The learning
      prior goes beyond a complexity or preference choice when we use it to increase
      the confidence of identification, expressed as a posterior, which increases
      as more examples are given. We highlight the existing trade-off between three
      elements: the bound on teaching dimension, the representativeness of the sample
      and the certainty of the identification. This has implications for the understanding

      article is a study of descriptive complexity of subsets of represented spaces.
      Two competing measures of descriptive complexity are available. The first one
      is topological and measures how complex it is to obtain a set from open sets
      using boolean operations. The second one measures how complex it is to test
      membership in the set, and we call it symbolic complexity because it measures
      the complexity of the symbolic representation of the set. While topological
      and symbolic complexity are equivalent on countably-based spaces, they differ
      on more general spaces. Our investigation is aimed at explaining this difference
      and highly suggests that it is related to the well-known mismatch between topological

      "abstract": "The concept of health system resilience has gained popularity in
      the global health discourse, fea-turing in UN policies, academic articles and
      conferences. While substantial effort has gone into the conceptualization of
      health system resilience, there has been no review of how the concept has been
      operationalized in empirical studies. We conducted an empirical review in three
      databases using systematic methods. Findings were synthesized using descriptive
      quantitative analysis and by mapping aims, \ufb01ndings, underlying concepts
      and measurement approaches according to the resilience de\ufb01nition by Blanchet
      et al . We identi\ufb01ed 71 empirical studies on health system resilience from
      2008 to 2019, with an increase in literature in recent years (62% of studies
      published since 2017). Most studies addressed a speci\ufb01c crisis or challenge
      (82%), most notably infectious disease outbreaks (20%), natural disasters (15%)
      and climate change (11%). A large proportion of studies focused on service delivery
      (48%), while other health system building blocks were side-lined. The studies
      differed in terms of their disciplinary tradition and conceptual background,
      which was re\ufb02ected in the variety of concepts and measurement approaches
      used. Despite extensive theoretical work on the domains which constitute health
      system resilience, we found that most of the empirical literature only addressed
      particular aspects related to absorptive and adaptive capacities, with legitimacy
      of institutions and transformative resilience seldom addressed. Qualitative
      and mixed methods research captured a broader range of resilience domains than
      quantitative research. The review shows that the way in which resilience is
      currently applied in the empirical literature does not match its theoretical
      foundations. In order to do justice to the complexities of the resilience concept,
      knowledge from both quantitative and qualitative research traditions should
      be integrated in a comprehensive assessment framework. Only then will the theoretical
      \u2018resilience idea\u2019 be able to prove its usefulness for the research
      community.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 90, "citationCount":

      "In the process of network interaction, CAPTCHA (completely automated public
      Turing test to tell computers and humans apart) is usually required. At present,
      the main method for differentiating between humans and machines is to use CAPTCHA,
      which includes images and text. Users need to interface with CAPTCHA for verification,
      which prolongs the interaction step. The interactive experience is poor, and
      the process of verification is not concealed. To simplify the verification process,
      optimize the interaction behavior and increase the security of verification,
      this paper proposes a CAPTCHA method based on a user''s mouse operation behavior,
      and carries out a study on cursor trajectory recognition. This method can reduce
      the manual procedure and improve the user interactive experience. In this article,
      we propose an ensemble learning algorithm model based on sliding sampling to
      classify and recognize cursor trajectory data. Experiments show that the classification
      performance of the model is reliable for recognition based on human\u2013machine
      cursor trajectories, which is a new concept for CAPTCHA.", "venue": "IEEE Consumer

      The motto of the researchers was to know if chatbots can able to fool the clients

      plenty of effort done with the introduction of the ELIZA chatbot in the year
      1966. Various approaches for the development of chatbots and different technologies
      in the creation of chatbots developed because of those efforts. NLTK is a module
      in python which can able to perform Natural Language Processing. It is used
      to analyse the input in the form of speech and generate responses that are similar
      to humans. Nowadays there is a lot of demand for virtual assistants such as
      Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant and Alexa, and speech-based search engines.
      Nowadays Chatbots are gaining massive demand mainly in the business sector for
      automating client service and also for reducing efforts of humans. Chatbots
      typically used for information acquisition in dialogue systems. To perfectly
      imitate a human response, a chatbot should examine the query asked by a client
      correctly and design an appropriate response. In this study we compare and discuss

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Iterative joints are a hallmark of the tetrapod limb,
      and their positioning is a key step during limb development. Although the molecular
      regulation of joint formation is well studied, it remains unclear what controls
      the location, number and orientation (i.e. the pattern) of joints within each
      digit. Here, we propose the dot-stripe mechanism for joint patterning, comprising
      two coupled Turing systems inspired by published gene expression patterns. Our
      model can explain normal joint morphology in wild-type limbs, hyperphalangy
      in cetacean flippers, mutant phenotypes with misoriented joints and suggests
      a reinterpretation of the polydactylous Ichthyosaur fins as a polygonal joint
      lattice. By formulating a generic dot-stripe model, describing joint patterns
      rather than molecular joint markers, we demonstrate that the insights from the
      model should apply regardless of the biological specifics of the underlying
      mechanism, thus providing a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning
      in the tetrapod limb. Summary: A dot-stripe Turing mechanism can reproduce a
      wide diversity of joint patterns observed in the tetrapod lineage, providing
      a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning in the tetrapod limb.",

      Signals", "abstract": "The Fourier transform is an important operation in signal
      processing. However, its exact computation on digital computers can be problematic.
      In this paper we consider the computability of the Fourier transform and the
      discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT). We construct a computable bandlimited
      absolutely integrable signal that has a continuous Fourier transform, which
      is, however, not Turing computable. Further, we also construct a computable
      sequence such that the DTFT is not Turing computable. Turing computability models
      what is theoretically implementable on a digital computer. Hence, our result
      shows that the Fourier transform of certain signals cannot be computed on digital
      hardware of any kind, including CPUs, FPGAs, and DSPs. This also implies that
      there is no symmetry between the time and frequency domain with respect to computability.
      Therefore, numerical approaches which employ the frequency domain representation
      of a signal (like calculating the convolution by performing a multiplication
      in the frequency domain) can be problematic. Interestingly, an idealized analog
      machine can compute the Fourier transform. However, it is unclear whether and
      how this theoretical superiority of the analog machine can be translated into
      practice. Further, we show that it is not possible to find an algorithm that
      can always decide for a given signal whether the Fourier transform is computable

      via Exchange of Integer Values between Adjacent Cells", "abstract": "The Turing
      pattern model is one of the theories used to describe organism formation patterns.
      Using this model, self-organized patterns emerge due to differences in the concentrations
      of activators and inhibitors. Here a cellular automata (CA)-like model was constructed
      wherein the Turing patterns emerged via the exchange of integer values between
      adjacent cells. In this simple hexagonal grid model, each cell state changed
      according to information exchanged from the six adjacent cells. The distinguishing
      characteristic of this model is that it presents a different pattern formation
      mechanism using only one kind of token, such as a chemical agent that ages via
      spatial diffusion. Using this CA-like model, various Turing-like patterns (spots
      or stripes) emerge when changing two of four parameters. This model has the
      ability to support Turing instability that propagates in the neighborhood space;
      global patterns are observed to spread from locally limited patterns. This model
      is not a substitute for a conventional Turing model but rather is a simplified
      Turing model. Using this model, it is possible to control the formation of multiple
      robots into such forms as circle groups or dividing a circle group into two

      "title": "The Pax6 master control gene initiates spontaneous retinal development
      via a self-organising Turing network", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Understanding how
      complex organ systems are assembled from simple embryonic tissues is a major
      challenge. Across the animal kingdom a great diversity of visual organs are
      initiated by a \u2018master control gene\u2019 called Pax6, which is both necessary
      and sufficient for eye development. Yet precisely how Pax6 achieves this deeply
      homologous function is poorly understood. Using the chick as a model organism,
      we show that vertebrate Pax6 interacts with a pair of morphogen-coding genes,
      Tgfb2 and Fst, to form a putative Turing network, which we have computationally
      modelled. Computer simulations suggest that this gene network is sufficient
      to spontaneously polarise the developing retina, establishing the first organisational
      axis of the eye and prefiguring its further development. Our findings reveal
      how retinal self-organisation may be initiated independently of the highly ordered
      tissue interactions that help to assemble the eye in vivo. These results help
      to explain how stem cell aggregates spontaneously self-organise into functional
      eye-cups in vitro. We anticipate these findings will help to underpin retinal
      organoid technology, which holds much promise as a platform for disease modelling,
      drug development and regenerative therapies. Highlighted Article: Pax6 can induce
      ectopic eye development in vivo, while retinal organoids can self-organise in
      vitro. We identify a Pax6 Turing network that could explain both phenomena.",

      "title": "Statistical Complexity Analysis of Turing Machine tapes with Fixed
      Algorithmic Complexity Using the Best-Order Markov Model", "abstract": "Sources
      that generate symbolic sequences with algorithmic nature may differ in statistical
      complexity because they create structures that follow algorithmic schemes, rather
      than generating symbols from a probabilistic function assuming independence.
      In the case of Turing machines, this means that machines with the same algorithmic
      complexity can create tapes with different statistical complexity. In this paper,
      we use a compression-based approach to measure global and local statistical
      complexity of specific Turing machine tapes with the same number of states and
      alphabet. Both measures are estimated using the best-order Markov model. For
      the global measure, we use the Normalized Compression (NC), while, for the local
      measures, we define and use normal and dynamic complexity profiles to quantify
      and localize lower and higher regions of statistical complexity. We assessed
      the validity of our methodology on synthetic and real genomic data showing that
      it is tolerant to increasing rates of editions and block permutations. Regarding
      the analysis of the tapes, we localize patterns of higher statistical complexity
      in two regions, for a different number of machine states. We show that these
      patterns are generated by a decrease of the tape\u2019s amplitude, given the
      setting of small rule cycles. Additionally, we performed a comparison with a
      measure that uses both algorithmic and statistical approaches (BDM) for analysis
      of the tapes. Naturally, BDM is efficient given the algorithmic nature of the
      tapes. However, for a higher number of states, BDM is progressively approximated
      by our methodology. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm to increase the statistical
      complexity of a Turing machine tape while retaining the same algorithmic complexity.
      We supply a publicly available implementation of the algorithm in C++ language
      under the GPLv3 license. All results can be reproduced in full with scripts

      "2012 was the Alan Turing Year \u2014 the celebration of the 100th anniversary
      of Alan Turing\u2019s birth. Turing\u2019s biographer Andrew Hodges in the \u201cForward\u201d
      to The Turing Guide comments that \u201cTuring\u2019s centenary year reflected
      a general public sense that the issues of Alan Turing\u2019s life and work are
      as relevant as ever in the twentyfirst century.\u201d The Turing Guide consists
      of 42 essays that are written for general readers and that celebrate Turing\u2019s:
      life (38 pages), accomplishments in mathematics (44 pages), codebreaking (120
      pages), On Computable Numbers and the Turing machine (36 pages), postwar work
      on computers (67 pages), contributions to morphogenesis (32 pages), ideas related
      to machine intelligence (86 pages), and legacy (32 pages). Eleven essays deal
      directly with codebreaking. Copeland either wrote, participated in the writing
      of, or revised 16 of the essays. Of the eight essays in the section \u201cArtificial
      Intelligence and the Mind,\u201d three were written by Diane Proudfoot and one
      includes her as a coauthor with Copeland (who wrote one other essay and coauthored
      a third essay in that section). The book begins with an overview of Turing\u2019s
      life and work by Copeland and Bowen. The essay is mostly a timeline of Turing\u2019s
      life. The authors suggest that Turing\u2019s death might have been accidental.
      Chapter 3, \u201cMeeting a Genius\u201d (4 pages), is by mathematician and Bletchley
      Park codebreaker Peter Hilton (1923\u20132010). Notes to the chapter (p. 485)
      state that the chapter was \u201cassembled by Jack Copeland\u201d and \u201cpublished
      with the permission of [Hilton\u2019s] wife.\u201d It is also noted that \u201c[in]
      2001 and again in 2002 [Hilton] visited Copeland at the University of Canterbury
      in New Zealand, where he delivered lectures on Turing and codebreaking. [The]
      chapter is a compilation of extracts from [Hilton\u2019s] papers and notes left
      in New Zealand, together with extracts from [Hilton\u2019s]", "venue": "Cryptologia",

      and numerical analysis, is carried out on the Gierer-Meinhardt activator-substrate

      It shows that under some conditions, diffusion-driven instability, i.e, the
      Turing instability, about the equilibrium point will occur, which is stable
      without diffusion. These diffusion-driven instabilities will lead to the occurrence
      of spatially nonhomogeneous solutions. Consequently, some pattern formations,

      "Abstract Pattern formation in clouds is a well-known feature, which can be
      observed almost every day. However, the guiding processes for structure formation
      are mostly unknown, and also theoretical investigations of cloud patterns are
      quite rare. From many scientific disciplines the occurrence of patterns in non-equilibrium
      systems due to Turing instabilities is known, i.e. unstable modes grow and form
      spatial structures. In this study we investigate a generic cloud model for the
      possibility of Turing instabilities. For this purpose, the model is extended
      by diffusion terms. We can show that for some cloud models, i.e special cases
      of the generic model, no Turing instabilities are possible. However, we also
      present a general class of cloud models, where Turing instabilities can occur.
      A key requisite is the occurrence of (weakly) nonlinear terms for accretion.
      Using numerical simulations for a special case of the general class of cloud
      models, we show spatial patterns of clouds in one and two spatial dimensions.
      From the numerical simulations we can see that the competition between collision
      terms and sedimentation is an important issue for the existence of pattern formation.",

      Spatial patterns revealed by epidemic models governed by reaction-diffusion
      systems can serve as a potential trend indicator of disease spread; thus, they
      have received wide attention. To characterize important features of disease
      spread, there are two important factors that cannot be ignored in the reaction-diffusion
      systems. One is that a susceptible individual has an ability to recognize the
      infected ones and keep away from them. The other is that populations are usually
      organized as networks instead of being continuously distributed in space. Consequently,
      it is essential to study patterns generated by epidemic models with self- and
      cross-diffusion on complex networks. Here, with the help of a linear analysis
      method, we study Turing instability induced by cross-diffusion for a network
      organized SIR epidemic model and explore Turing patterns on several different

      "Chatbots are software programs that interact with clients using natural languages.
      The motto of the researchers was to know if chatbots can able to fool the clients
      that they were real humans. To develop a chatbot that can pass the Turing test,
      plenty of effort done with the introduction of the ELIZA chatbot in the year
      1966. Various approaches for the development of chatbots and different technologies
      in the creation of chatbots developed because of those efforts. NLTK is a module
      in python which can able to perform Natural Language Processing. It is used
      to analyse the input in the form of speech and generate responses that are similar
      to humans. Nowadays there is a lot of demand for virtual assistants such as
      Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant and Alexa, and speech-based search engines.
      Nowadays Chatbots are gaining massive demand mainly in the business sector for
      automating client service and also for reducing efforts of humans. Chatbots
      typically used for information acquisition in dialogue systems. To perfectly
      imitate a human response, a chatbot should examine the query asked by a client
      correctly and design an appropriate response. In this study we compare and discuss
      the different technologies used in the chatbots and also address the design
      and implementation of a chatbot system.", "venue": "International Conference

      can be algorithmically computed on an abstract machine (a Turing machine). It
      is shown that there exist computable spectral densities with very good analytic
      properties (i.e. smooth with finite energy) such that the corresponding spectral
      factor cannot be determined on a Turing machine. Further, it will be proved
      that it is impossible to decide algorithmically whether or not a given computable
      density possesses a computable spectral factor. This negative result has consequences
      for applications of spectral factorization in computer-aided design, because
      there it is necessary that this problem be decidable. Conversely, this paper
      will show that if the logarithm of a computable spectral density belongs to
      certain Sobolev space of sufficiently smooth functions, then the spectral factor
      is always computable. As an application, the paper discusses the possibility

      "abstract": "The last decade has seen the rise of neuromorphic architectures
      based on artificial spiking neural networks, such as the SpiNNaker, TrueNorth,
      and Loihi systems. The massive parallelism and co-locating of computation and
      memory in these architectures potentially allows for an energy usage that is
      orders of magnitude lower compared to traditional Von Neumann architectures.
      However, to date a comparison with more traditional computational architectures
      (particularly with respect to energy usage) is hampered by the lack of a formal
      machine model and a computational complexity theory for neuromorphic computation.
      In this paper we take the first steps towards such a theory. We introduce spiking
      neural networks as a machine model where---in contrast to the familiar Turing
      machine---information and the manipulation thereof are co-located in the machine.
      We introduce canonical problems, define hierarchies of complexity classes and
      provide some first completeness results.", "venue": "Neuro Inspired Computational

      "Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain systems that supports more than
      half a million transactions every day and fosters miscellaneous decentralized
      applications with its Turing-complete smart contract machine. Whereas it remains
      mysterious what the transaction pattern of Ethereum is and how it evolves over
      time. In this paper, we study the evolutionary behavior of Ethereum transactions
      from a temporal graph point of view. We first develop a data analytics platform
      to collect external transactions associated with users as well as internal transactions
      initiated by smart contracts. Three types of temporal graphs, user-to-user,
      contract-to-contract and user-contract graphs, are constructed according to
      trading relationship and are segmented with an appropriate time window. We observe
      a strong correlation between the size of user-to-user transaction graph and
      the average Ether price in a time window, while no evidence of such linkage
      is shown at the average degree, average edge weights and average triplet closure
      duration. The macroscopic and microscopic burstiness of Ethereum transactions
      is validated. We analyze the Gini indexes of the transaction graphs and the
      user wealth in which Ethereum is found to be very unfair since the very beginning,
      in a sense, \"the rich is already very rich\".", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year":

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Family Medicine: Better Together.", "abstract":
      "According to futurists, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution in health
      care is here.1 While trending now, the concept is not new and was first introduced
      70 years ago when Alan Turing described \u201cthinking machines.\u201d2 John
      McCarthy later coined the term \u201cAI\u201d to denote the idea of getting
      a computer to do things which, when done by people, are said to involve intelligence.3
      What is new is the digitization of everything from electronic health records
      (EHRs) to genes and microbiomes, which provide the data that AI needs to learn.
      This conversion of images, handwritten notes, and pathology slides into 1\u2019s
      and 0\u2019s allows machines to perform a wide range of tasks, such as detecting
      retinopathy, skin cancer, and lung nodules.4-6 Even though this surge of available
      data exceeds what individuals and teams can realistically manage, computers
      have learned how to process these data to predict outcomes important to our
      patients, including opioid misuse, emergency department visits, and deaths.7-9
      Advances like these led Andy Conrad, the CEO of Google\u2019s life sciences
      subsidiary, to declare that in medicine, \u201cthe most important tool is the
      computer.\u201d10 This revolution has proceeded without AI publications in our
      journals, and our discipline is missing an opportunity to shape its future.
      A PubMed search reveals no AI or machine learning papers in Family Medicine,
      Annals of Family Medicine, or the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine.
      For comparison, AI and machine learning papers number 18, 77, and 8 for Academic
      Medicine, JAMA, and the Journal of General Internal Medicine, respectively.
      While family medicine scholars are engaged in AI research11-13 and others reference
      it,14 family medicine\u2019s voice needs to be amplified. Without our input,
      AI risks following the path of EHRs. When the Health Information Technology
      for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was passed, policy makers believed
      that EHRs would lead to care that was more efficient, effective, and equitable,15
      and EHRs have led to important advances in population health and quality.16
      However, with increasing burnout and decreasing time with patients, many lament
      that EHRs cater to the needs of administrators and EHR vendors rather than physicians
      and patients.17 The usability and interoperability failures underlying these
      complaints are not the result of gaps in technological expertise. Instead, these
      failures emerged, in part, because end-users like ourselves have been insufficiently
      engaged in relevant design, policy, and implementation decisions. As AI spreads,
      our participation is needed to shape this revolution. Without our patient-centered
      orientation, AI has focused on delivering value to shareholders of technology
      companies rather than on problems that affect patients in our practices. Without
      our focus on value, AI has escalated health care costs and is available only
      to those with resources rather than those who would benefit the most. Without
      our focus on personal relationships, AI has further eroded face time by increasing
      the amount of time we spend interacting with computers. Without the breadth
      of our patients, AI has magnified existing biases. For example, as indicated
      in the literature, algorithms used by Artificial Intelligence and Family Medicine:

      the signals in different states, including the Turing pattern, the chaos, the
      single soliton state and multisolitons state, can be distinguished according
      to different distributions of the eigenvalue spectrum. Specially, the eigenvalue
      spectrum of single soliton pulse is composed of a pair of conjugate symmetric
      discrete eigenvalues and the quasi-continuous eigenvalue spectrum with eye-like
      structure. Moreover, we have successfully demonstrated that the number of discrete
      eigenvalue pairs in the eigenvalue spectrum corresponds to the number of solitons
      formed in a round-trip time inside the Kerr microresonator. This work shows

      The lung airway and vascular trees are generated during embryogenesis from a
      small set of building codes similar to Turing mechanisms that create robust
      trees ideally suited to their functions. While the blood flow pattern generated
      by these fractal trees has been shown to be genetically determined, the geometry

      resolution bronchial trees in 3 dimensions from the 4 most commonly studied
      laboratory mice (B6C3F1, BALB/c, C57BL/6 and CD-1). The data fit a fractal model
      well for all animals with the fractal dimensions ranging from 1.54 to 1.67,
      indicating that the conducting airway of mice can be considered a self-similar
      and space filling structure. We determined that the fractal dimensions of these
      airway trees differed by strain but not sex, reinforcing the concept that airway
      branching patterns are encoded within the DNA. The observations also highlight

      work in two parts tries to promote a new method in Mathematical Modeling, not
      ever used before, namely the use of the methods of Non-standard Analysis in
      Topoi. For the general mathematical theory of topoi (Topoi Theory) we refer
      to the book [10] . For non-standard analysis in the particular Boolean topos
      SET (the category of sets) we refer to the book [11]. This first part of the
      work is related, from an applicative point of view, mainly with Mathematical
      Neuroscience, more precisely a model of the human thinking, consciousness and
      subconsciousness. The connections between brain and mind will be also scketched,
      but a closer study also need some further topics to be studied in Part II: Artificial
      Intelligence, namely (Quantum) neural networks and (Quantum) Turing machine.
      However both parts (I. and II.) should be considered together, because they
      complement each other. The topoi model the intuitionistic logic (multi-valued)
      and have been used in Quantum Physics (see [9] and its references) while Non-Standard
      Analysis in SET (introduced by Abraham Robinson[31]) has been applied in Mathematical
      Economics (see [2] and its references); however, the combination was never used
      until now in Applied Mathematics. Even more, the Non-standard Analysis in Topoi
      is not too much studied from the point of view of Pure Mathematics either. One
      of the main objective of this work is to produce progress in this aria of Mathematics
      also, mainly for the SET-type topoi and exponential topoi, those topoi used
      in Quantum Physics and in which we need Non-stantard Analysis for our purposes.
      Based on the paper [13] we propose the logic of non-standard Preprints (www.preprints.org)

      and irregular vegetation pattern formation in semiarid regions is an important
      field in ecology. Applying the framework of coupled map lattice, a novel nonlinear
      space- and time-discrete model is developed based on discretizing the classical
      Klausmeier model and the vegetation pattern formation in semiarid regions is
      restudied in this research. Through analysis of Turing-type instability for
      the discrete model, the conditions for vegetation pattern formation are determined.
      The discrete model is verified by Klausmeier\u2019s results with the same parametric
      data, and shows advantages in quantitatively describing diverse vegetation patterns
      in semiarid regions, such as the patterns of regular mosaicirregular patches,
      stripes, fractured stripesspots, and stripes-spots, in comparing with former
      theoretical models. Moreover, the discrete model predicts variations of rainfall
      and vegetation types can cause transitions of vegetation patterns. This research
      demonstrates that the nonlinear mechanism of the discrete model better captures
      the diversity and complexity of vegetation pattern formation in semiarid regions.",

      "title": "Teaching Machines to Converse", "abstract": "The ability of a machine
      to communicate with humans has long been associated with the general success
      of AI. This dates back to Alan Turing''s epoch-making work in the early 1950s,
      which proposes that a machine''s intelligence can be tested by how well it,
      the machine, can fool a human into believing that the machine is a human through
      dialogue conversations. Many systems learn generation rules from a minimal set
      of authored rules or labels on top of hand-coded rules or templates, and thus
      are both expensive and difficult to extend to open-domain scenarios. Recently,
      the emergence of neural network models the potential to solve many of the problems
      in dialogue learning that earlier systems cannot tackle: the end-to-end neural
      frameworks offer the promise of scalability and language-independence, together
      with the ability to track the dialogue state and then mapping between states
      and dialogue actions in a way not possible with conventional systems. On the
      other hand, neural systems bring about new challenges: they tend to output dull
      and generic responses; they lack a consistent or a coherent persona; they are
      usually optimized through single-turn conversations and are incapable of handling
      the long-term success of a conversation; and they are not able to take the advantage
      of the interactions with humans. This dissertation attempts to tackle these
      challenges: Contributions are two-fold: (1) we address new challenges presented
      by neural network models in open-domain dialogue generation systems; (2) we
      develop interactive question-answering dialogue systems by (a) giving the agent
      the ability to ask questions and (b) training a conversation agent through interactions
      with humans in an online fashion, where a bot improves through communicating
      with humans and learning from the mistakes that it makes.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "abstract": "The zero-error capacity of a discrete classical channel was first
      defined by Shannon as the least upper bound of rates for which one transmits
      information with zero probability of error. The problem of finding the zero-error
      capacity C0, which assigns a capacity to each channel as a function, was reformulated
      in terms of graph theory as a function \u0398, which assigns a value to each
      simple graph. This paper studies the computability of the zero-error capacity.
      For the computability, the concept of a Turing machine and a Kolmogorov oracle
      is used. It is unknown if the zero-error capacity is computable in general.
      We show that in general the zero-error capacity is semi-computable with the
      help of a Kolmogorov Oracle. Furthermore, we show that C0 and \u0398 are computable
      functions if and only if there is a computable sequence of computable functions
      of upper bounds, i.e. the converse exist in the sense of information theory,

      "In the process of network interaction, CAPTCHA (completely automated public
      Turing test to tell computers and humans apart) is usually required. At present,
      the main method for differentiating between humans and machines is to use CAPTCHA,
      which includes images and text. Users need to interface with CAPTCHA for verification,
      which prolongs the interaction step. The interactive experience is poor, and
      the process of verification is not concealed. To simplify the verification process,
      optimize the interaction behavior and increase the security of verification,
      this paper proposes a CAPTCHA method based on a user''s mouse operation behavior,
      and carries out a study on cursor trajectory recognition. This method can reduce
      the manual procedure and improve the user interactive experience. In this article,
      we propose an ensemble learning algorithm model based on sliding sampling to
      classify and recognize cursor trajectory data. Experiments show that the classification

      "Malware plays a significant role in breaching computer systems. Previous research
      has focused on malware detection even though detection is up against theoretical
      limits in computer science and current methods are inadequate in practice. We
      explain the susceptibility of computation to malware as a consequence of the
      instability of Turing and register machine computation. The behavior of a register
      machine program can be sabotaged, by making a very small change to the original,
      uninfected program. Stability has been studied extensively in dynamical systems
      and in engineering fields such as aerospace. Our primary contribution introduces
      mathematical tools from topology and dynamical systems to explain why register
      machine computation is susceptible to malware sabotage. A correspondence is
      constructed such that one computational step of a Turing machine maps to one
      iteration of a dynamical system in the x-y plane and vice versa. Using this
      correspondence, another contribution defines and demonstrates a structural instability
      in a Universal Turing machine encoding. One research direction proposes to better
      understand instability in conventional computation by studying non-isolated
      metrics on the space of Turing machines; another suggests searching for stable
      computation in unconventional machines.", "venue": "Hawaii International Conference

      models are present in the literature. For example, by suitably restricting more
      general models such as context-free grammars, pushdown automata, and Turing
      machines, that characterize wider classes of languages, it is possible to obtain
      formal models that generate or recognize regular languages only. These restricted
      formalisms provide alternative representations of Type 3 languages that may
      be significantly more concise than other models that share the same express-
      ing power. The goal of this work is to provide an overview of old and recent
      re- sults on these formal systems from a descriptional complexity perspective,
      that is the study of the relationships between the sizes of such devices. We

      "abstract": "Glycolysis is a tightly regulated process in which several enzymes,
      such as hexokinases (HKs), play crucial roles. Cancer cells are characterized
      by specific expression levels of several isoenzymes in different metabolic pathways
      and these fea-tures offer possibilities for therapeutic interventions. Overexpression
      of HKs (mostly of the HK2 isoform) has been con-sistently reported in numerous
      types of cancer. Moreover, deletion of HK2 has been shown to decrease cancer
      cell prolif-eration without explicit side effects in animal models, which suggests
      that targeting HK2 is a viable strategy for cancer therapy. HK2 inhibition causes
      a substantial decrease of glycolysis that affects multiple pathways of central
      metabolism and also destabilizes the mitochondrial outer membrane, ultimately
      enhancing cell death. Although glycolysis inhibition has met limited success,
      partly due to low selectivity for specific isoforms and excessive side effects
      of the reported HK inhibitors, there is ample ground for progress. The current
      review is focused on HK2 inhibition, envisaging the development of potent and
      selective anticancer agents. The information on function, expression, and activity
      of HKs is presented, along with their structures, known inhibitors, and reported
      effects of HK2 ablation/inhibition. The structural features of the different
      isozymes are discussed, aiming to stimulate a more rational approach to the
      design of selective HK2 inhibitors with appropriate drug-like properties. Particu-lar
      attention is dedicated to a structural and sequence comparison of the structurally
      similar HK1 and HK2 isoforms, aim-ing to unveil differences that could be explored
      therapeutically. Finally, several additional catalytic- and non-catalytic roles
      on different pathways and diseases, recently attributed to HK2, are reviewed

      network for automatic subcentimeter pulmonary adenocarcinoma classification.",
      "abstract": "Background\nThe efficient and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma
      before surgery is of considerable significance to clinicians. Although computed
      tomography (CT) examinations are widely used in practice, it is still challenging
      and time-consuming for radiologists to distinguish between different types of
      subcentimeter pulmonary nodules. Although there have been many deep learning
      algorithms proposed, their performance largely depends on vast amounts of data,
      which is difficult to collect in the medical imaging area. Therefore, we propose
      an automatic classification system for subcentimeter pulmonary adenocarcinoma,
      combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a generative adversarial
      network (GAN) to optimize clinical decision-making and to provide small dataset
      algorithm design ideas.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 206 nodules with postoperative
      pathological labels were analyzed. Among them were 30 adenocarcinomas in situ
      (AISs), 119 minimally invasive adenocarcinomas (MIAs), and 57 invasive adenocarcinomas
      (IACs). Our system consisted of two parts, a GAN-based image synthesis, and
      a CNN classification. First, several popular existing GAN techniques were employed
      to augment the datasets, and comprehensive experiments were conducted to evaluate
      the quality of the GAN synthesis. Additionally, our classification system processes
      were based on two-dimensional (2D) nodule-centered CT patches without the need
      of manual labeling information.\n\n\nResults\nFor GAN-based image synthesis,
      the visual Turing test showed that even radiologists could not tell the GAN-synthesized
      from the raw images (accuracy: primary radiologist 56%, senior radiologist 65%).
      For CNN classification, our progressive growing wGAN improved the performance
      of CNN most effectively (area under the curve =0.83). The experiments indicated
      that the proposed GAN augmentation method improved the classification accuracy
      by 23.5% (from 37.0% to 60.5%) and 7.3% (from 53.2% to 60.5%) in comparison
      with training methods using raw and common augmented images respectively. The
      performance of this combined GAN and CNN method (accuracy: 60.5%\u00b12.6%)
      was comparable to the state-of-the-art methods, and our CNN was also more lightweight.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe
      experiments revealed that GAN synthesis techniques could effectively alleviate
      the problem of insufficient data in medical imaging. The proposed GAN plus CNN
      framework can be generalized for use in building other computer-aided detection
      (CADx) algorithms and thus assist in diagnosis.", "venue": "Quantitative Imaging

      of interacting populations is an active area of research, and various modeling
      approaches have been adopted to describe their dynamics. Mathematical models
      of such interactions using differential equations are capable to mimic the stationary
      and oscillating (regular or irregular) population distributions. Recently, some
      researchers have paid their attention to explain the consequences of transient
      dynamics of population density (especially the long transients) and able to
      capture such behaviors with simple models. Existence of multiple stationary
      patches and settlement to a stable distribution after a long quasi-stable transient
      dynamics can be explained by spatiotemporal models with nonlocal interaction
      terms. However, the studies of such interesting phenomena for three interacting
      species are not abundant in literature. Motivated by these facts here we have
      considered a three species prey\u2013predator model where the predator is generalist
      in nature as it survives on two prey species. Nonlocalities are introduced in
      the intra-specific competition terms for the two prey species in order to model
      the accessibility of nearby resources. Using linear analysis, we have derived
      the Turing instability conditions for both the spatiotemporal models with and
      without nonlocal interactions. Validation of such conditions indicates the possibility
      of existence of stationary spatially heterogeneous distributions for all the
      three species. Existence of long transient dynamics has been presented under
      certain parametric domain. Exhaustive numerical simulations reveal various scenarios
      of stabilization of population distribution due to the presence of nonlocal
      intra-specific competition for the two prey species. Chaotic oscillation exhibited
      by the temporal model is significantly suppressed when the populations are allowed
      to move over their habitat and prey species can access the nearby resources.",

      "Considering links between logic and physics is important because of the fast
      development of quantum information technologies in our everyday life. This paper
      discusses a new method in logic inspired from quantum theory using operators,
      named Eigenlogic. It expresses logical propositions using linear algebra. Logical
      functions are represented by operators and logical truth tables correspond to
      the eigenvalue structure. It extends the possibilities of classical logic by
      changing the semantics from the Boolean binary alphabet {0,1} using projection
      operators to the binary alphabet {+1,\u22121} employing reversible involution
      operators. Also, many-valued logical operators are synthesized, for whatever
      alphabet, using operator methods based on Lagrange interpolation and on the
      Cayley\u2013Hamilton theorem. Considering a superposition of logical input states
      one gets a fuzzy logic representation where the fuzzy membership function is
      the quantum probability given by the Born rule. Historical parallels from Boole,
      Post, Poincar\u00e9 and Combinatory Logic are presented in relation to probability
      theory, non-commutative quaternion algebra and Turing machines. An extension
      to first order logic is proposed inspired by Grover\u2019s algorithm. Eigenlogic
      is essentially a logic of operators and its truth-table logical semantics is
      provided by the eigenvalue structure which is shown to be related to the universality
      of logical quantum gates, a fundamental role being played by non-commutativity
      and entanglement.", "venue": "Entropy", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 43,

      "title": "Wittgenstein on ethics: Working through Lebensformen", "abstract":
      "In his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein conveyed the idea that
      ethics cannot be located in an object or self-standing subject matter of propositional
      discourse, true or false. At the same time, he took his work to have an eminently
      ethical purpose, and his attitude was not that of the emotivist. The trajectory
      of this conception of the normativity of philosophy as it developed in his subsequent
      thought is traced. It is explained that and how the notion of a \u2018form of
      life\u2019 (Lebensform) emerged only in his later thought, in 1937, earmarking
      a significant step forward in his philosophical method. We argue that the concept
      of Lebensform represents a way of domesticating logic itself, the very idea
      of a claim or reason, supplementing the idea of a \u2018language game\u2019,
      which it deepens. Lebensform is contrasted with the phenomenologists\u2019 Lebenswelt
      through a reading of the notions of \u2018I\u2019, \u2018world\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019
      as they were treated in the Tractatus, The Blue and Brown Books and Philosophical
      Investigations. Finally, the notion of Lebensform is shown to have replaced
      the notion of culture (Kultur) in Philosophical Investigations. Wittgenstein\u2019s
      spring 1937 \u2018domestication\u2019 of the nature of logic is shown to have
      been fully consonant with the idea that he was influenced by his reading Alan
      Turing\u2019s 1936/1937 paper, \u2018On computable numbers, with an application
      to the Entscheidungsproblem\u2019.", "venue": "Philosophy & Social Criticism",

      to play games in human-like fashion is popularly considered a benchmark of progress
      in Artificial Intelligence. In our work, we introduce the first computational
      model aimed at Pictionary, the popular word-guessing social game. We first introduce
      Sketch-QA, a guessing task. Styled after Pictionary, Sketch-QA uses incrementally
      accumulated sketch stroke sequences as visual data. Sketch-QA involves asking
      a fixed question (\u201cWhat object is being drawn?\u201d) and gathering open-ended
      guess-words from human guessers. We analyze the resulting dataset and present
      many interesting findings therein. To mimic Pictionary-style guessing, we propose
      a deep neural model which generates guess-words in response to temporally evolving
      human-drawn object sketches. Our model even makes human-like mistakes while
      guessing, thus amplifying the human mimicry factor. We evaluate our model on
      the large-scale guess-word dataset generated via Sketch-QA task and compare
      with various baselines. We also conduct a Visual Turing Test to obtain human
      impressions of the guess-words generated by humans and our model. Experimental

      was achieved by converting a non-coding RNA into a long ssDNA that self-cleaves

      Including Schottky Diodes", "abstract": "This paper reports on the monolithic
      integration of layout-optimized Schottky diodes realized in an established 50-nm
      gate-length metamorphic high-electron-mobility transistor technology for use
      in multifunctional nonlinear circuits. The suitability of the realized Schottky
      diodes is demonstrated by a broadband millimeter-wave I/Q-mixer (In-phase/Quadrature)
      and local oscillator (LO) chain comprising two power amplifiers and a frequency
      tripler, fabricated on monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). Both
      circuits are based on an anti-parallel Schottky diode topology. The subharmonically-pumped
      I/Q-mixer covers an RF (radio frequency) and IF (intermediate frequency) range
      of at least 75 GHz to 110 GHz and 0.5 GHz to 15 GHz, respectively. The single-sideband
      conversion loss is between 14 dB and 16 dB across most of the entire RF and
      IF bands. The core of the LO chain consists of a frequency tripler (multiplier
      by three) and features a bias-adjustable output power with almost constant conversion
      efficiency and a control range of more than 8 dB. The fully-integrated LO chain
      MMIC matches the needs of the presented I/Q-mixer and exhibits an average output
      power of 16.3 dBm with a covered frequency range of 38 GHz to 60 GHz. The unwanted
      harmonics are suppressed by at least \u221225.9 dBc below the third harmonic
      for the entire frequency range and better than \u221232.1 dBc for most part
      of the band. Thus, the mixer and tripler MMICs demonstrate state-of-the-art
      performance with regards to, e.g., covered bandwidth, output power, harmonic
      suppression, or 1 dB compression point.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "year": 2020,

      "title": "Heterogeneous Reactions of SO3 on Ice: An Overlooked Sink for SO3
      Depletion.", "abstract": "The reaction between SO3 and water in the gas phase
      has always been of great interest as it has important implications to atmos-pheric
      and environment science. Compared to gas-phase water, however, heterogeneous
      hydration of SO3 on the surfaces of con-densed phase of water/ice are relatively
      less explored. Here, we present a systematic study of the reaction between SO3
      and three different phases of water, namely, water vapor, surface of liquid
      water droplet, and the {1 1 -2 0} plane of hexagonal ice (Ih). The computation
      results show that contrary to the gas-phase water, the surface of water droplet
      and {1 1 -2 0} plane of Ih ice play a distinctly different role in the reaction,
      in which the HSO4-/H3O+ is formed within a few picoseconds. Moreover, the SO3
      hydration exhibits multiple reaction pathways on the surface of water drop-let
      and {1 1 -2 0} plane of Ih ice, including the newly observed chemical mechanism
      without the formation of water-loop struc-tures. Considering temperature effects
      (winter vs. summer), SO3/water vapor concentration in atmosphere, and effective
      sur-face areas of water droplets in the atmosphere and ice on the ground, the
      reaction rates of SO3 with water in the gas phase, aerosols, clouds and snowpack
      are estimated and compared. Con-sistent with previous experimental studies,
      the loss rate of SO3 due to aerosols and clouds are less important compared
      to that due to water vapor. Surprisingly, the ice snowpack is shown to be an
      efficient sink for SO3 depletion, especially in the winter season.", "venue":

      performed between 2015 and 2017. The study population was divided into 2 groups:
      37 patients below 50 years of age (median [range] age, 34 [18\u201345] years)
      were included in group 1 and 37 patients above 50 years of age (median [range]
      age, 58 [50\u201372] years), in group 2. We collected data on selected clini\u00ad
      cal characteristics, heart catheterization, and echocardiography results (TABLE
      1). The balloon\u00ad \u00adstretched diameter of ASD was measured in 24 patients
      from group 1 and 24 from group 2. Applying a technique which was described elsewhere,6
      the following atrial septal occlud\u00ad ers were used: 40 Hyperion (Shanghai
      Shape Memory Alloy Co, Shanghai, China), 21 Heart R (Lifetech Scientific Corporation,
      Shenzen, China), 6 Cera (Lifetech Scientific Corporation, Shenzen, China), and
      7 Cocoon (Vascular In\u00ad novations, Nonthaburi, Thailand) occluders. To minimize
      nickel release to serum, the fol\u00ad lowing occluders have different protective
      lay\u00ad ers: preoxidized nitinol in Hyperion, titani\u00ad um nitride in Cera,
      and platinum in Cocoon. The Heart R occluder is produced without any protective
      layer on the nitinol wire. The appli\u00ad cation of the above mentioned devices
      depend\u00ad ed on its availability (results of conducted ten\u00ad ders). Patients
      in whom the ASO (Abbott Med\u00ad ical, Plymouth, Minnesota, United States)
      and Figulla (Occlutech GmbH, Jena, Germany) oc\u00ad cluders were used in this
      period were exclud\u00ad ed from the study in order to ensure homoge\u00ad neity
      of the sample. Introduction Transcatheter closure of atri\u00ad al septal defect
      (ASD) type II can be safely per\u00ad formed in children and adults.1,2 Since
      the im\u00ad plementation of the Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) in 1997, many
      similar nitinol wire mesh Amplatzer \u00adlike occluders have been developed.
      Nitinol is an alloy of nickel and titanium. Stud\u00ad ies revealed a rise in
      nickel serum concentration, especially in the first 3 months after the ASO im\u00ad
      plantation.3,4 To prevent this phenomenon as\u00ad sociated with the use of
      several Amplatzer \u00adlike occluders (also the ASO from 2014), different methods
      to pretreat nitinol wires were applied. The literature on the use of Chinese
      and Thai occluders for percutaneous ASD closure is scarce.5 All these Amplatzer
      \u00adlike occluders are very similar in shape, dimensions, struc\u00ad ture
      of the delivery system, and the technique of implantation. We described our
      experience with ASD clo\u00ad sure in adults patients with the ASO devices elsewhere.6

      the use of different nitinol wire devices (Chinese and Thai) with and without

      for the \ufb01 rst time, the use of casein extracted from expired milk for the

      with those of commercially available ACs. Electrochemical double layer capacitors
      (EDLCs) are energy storage devices that feature high power densities (10 kW
      kg (cid:1) 1 ) and long cycle life. [1] Both of these qualities are a result
      of the storage mechanism of EDLCs: the fast physical adsorption of the electrolyte

      The usable operative voltage of aqueous electrolytes is limited by the electrochemical

      voltages (up to 2.8 and 3.5 V, respectively). [3] However, these electrolytes

      to 42,154 article-abstracts from six high-impact 25 (Impact Factor > 0.9) journals
      (Water Resources Research WRR, Hydrology and Earth 26 System Sciences HESS,

      analyses of hydrologic science literature since 1991. We used a hybrid 29 objective-subjective
      approach to label a number of broad topics in this body of litera30 ture, and
      used these labeled topics to analyze topic trends, inter-topic relationships,
      and 31 journal diversity. As an example of what we can learn from this type
      of analysis, results 32 showed that data-driven research topics are gaining
      in popularity while some subsurface 33 related topics appeared to lose popularity
      within our journal set and time period. While 34 no journal in our sample was
      completely homogeneous, JHM and WRR exhibited the 35 most notable preferences
      for certain topics over others. The methods and outcomes of 36 this paper are
      potentially beneficial to scientists and researchers who aim to gain a con37
      textual understanding of the existing state of hydrologic science literature.

      of his interlocutors\u2014especially Vasari and Cellini\u2014proposes a compromise,
      prizing both pursuits in a common endeavor of harmonizing life by the imitation
      of nature. Over the years, critical appreciation of the lessons has been mixed.
      Carlo Dionisotti dismissed them as superficial; Julius Schlosser Magnino regarded
      them as excessively abstract; Paola Barocchi seemed to follow the official contemporary
      line articulated by Vincenzo Borghini, in playing down the significance. This
      first integral edition in over four centuries promises to move the critical
      appreciation in some of the new directions already suggested by Annalisa Andreoni
      and Salvatore Lo Re. Dubard invites a rereading in the light of a reevaluation
      of the whole period that is now under way; and the quality of this contribution
      bodes well for these aspirations.", "venue": "Renaissance Quarterly", "year":

      impact of El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation on rainfall distribution and productivity
      of major Agricultural crops in the Kembta Tembaro Zone of Southern Ethiopia
      over the past 30 years. Precipitation and temperature data were obtained from
      the National Meteorology Agency, crop data from the Central Statistical Agency
      of Ethiopia, and the Sea Surface Temperature data from the NOAA website. The
      rainfall trend had shown decreasing trend with high variability at all the stations
      (p<0.05). Over the same period, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a event were observed
      and highly affected rainfall distribution. It was found that Coefficient Variation
      was greater than 30%, which indicates the area was prone to drought episodes.
      The impacts of the ENSO events on the yield of Maize, Wheat, Barely, Sorghum
      and Enset were assessed. Wheat and Maize were highly affected by the ENSO events.
      Enset was found to be more resistant crop to the influence of ENSO. Barely and
      Sorghum were affected at varying magnitude. Among the five chosen crop for this
      investigation two of the crops were seriously affected during the two extremes,
      i.e. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. From this investigation it is conclude that
      the overall cereal crop productivity was decreased and precipitation variability
      was noticed. So, having the information about ENSO phase in advance can be used
      to forecast ENSO and select crop types and varieties to maximize agricultural
      rain fed cereal crop productivity while minimizing the crop risk associated
      with seasonal rainfall and ENSO phases.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      \"anti-crisis potential of a construction company\" is revealed, its constituent
      el-ements are highlighted and their characteristics are given. The peculiarities
      of using the anti-crisis potential to overcome the crisis, restore financial
      stability and solvency of the enterprise are studied. The theoretical and methodological
      basis of the article are the scientific works of domestic and foreign scientists
      who have studied the issues of crisis management and crisis potential. The main
      theoretical provisions related to solving the problem of formation and use of
      anti-crisis potential of con-struction companies, allow to increase economic
      stability and, as a consequence, the competitiveness of construction compa-nies
      in conditions of increased instability of the environment. The necessity of
      early diagnosis of crisis phenomena of con-struction enterprises, reliability
      of forecasting the loss of financial stability and the lack of sufficient information
      base create a problematic situation and the need for its scientific and practical
      solution. It is determined that the main components that need to be analysed
      are intellectual, material, investment and financial, labour and organizational
      resources and infrastruc-ture in order to form and implement the anti-crisis
      potential of the construction company. Approaches to assessing and man-aging
      the financial stability of the enterprise are aimed at developing new and adapting
      existing models, methods, tech-niques that can not only provide sufficient information
      about the current state of a small construction company, but also assess the
      base and opportunities for further development of this enterprise. The article

      of construction companies. Based on the analysis of generalizations and prelim-inary
      selection of factors is carried out that can signal the onset of crisis phenomena.

      study has been undertaken which simulates the process f pulverised coal preparation
      for combustion using plasmas. Two combustion model s (\u2018fast chemistry\u2019
      based on one-step fuel transformation into final products, and \u2018stretched
      laminar flamelets\u2019 with the detailed chemical mechanism for the combust
      ion of volatiles) are tested and validated with the experimental results. In
      a preliminary calc ulation, the spreading rate and temperature contours of the
      plasma jet emerging from the plasma generator nozzle were simulated, ignoring
      combustion. Subsequently, coal preparation calculations i ncluding the effects
      of combustion were performed for the plasma burner. Tempera ture profiles, coal
      particles history and species concentrations at the plasma burner exi t are
      presented and discussed. Introduction This paper emphasises the modelling of
      the plasma-assisted com bustion of pulverised coals in pulverised-fuel-fired
      thermo power plants (TPP). The motivation is to be found in the important role
      of pulverised coal as a fuel for power genera tion, and its significant harmful
      impact on the environment through gas and particulate e missions. In the present
      concept, a proportion of the pulverised coal and air mixture, diver te away
      from the bulk of the flow, is heated by an electric arc plasma within a separate
      plasma chamber. The highly reactive fuel fraction of unburned volatiles and
      partially gasifie d carbon residual so produced is then able to ignite the main
      stream of pulverised fuel/air mixture entering into the combustion chamber of
      the boiler. As a result, the consumption of conve nti al fuels (fossil oil or
      gas) required for boiler warm-up and flame stabilis at on is eliminated, while
      a higher overall efficiency and early ignition result in a reduction of emissions
      of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Mathematical Modelling A computational
      fluid dynamics code for calculating threedimensional turbulent reacting flows
      was used to predict the combustion be haviour of pulverised coal inside the
      plasma burner. The model, which is based on a finite volume discretisation technique,
      solves the mass and momentum equations using the SIMPLE 31st EPS Conference

      of the tool part during the electroarc processing of plowshares and the rationale
      for the rational parameters of local hardening, which will increase the wear
      resistance of the surfaces of the parts of tillage machines by their reflow
      using electroarc processing. The article presents the energy indicators of the
      electroarc processing of plowshares. According to the analysis of recent studies,
      it was found that for the simultaneous sharpening and hardening of plowshares,
      it is rational to use a DC arc discharge with liquid cooling and with the formation
      of hardened struc-tures. Based on the results of theoretical studies, the heat
      balance is determined by the electroarc processing, which allows you to establish
      the most significant factors that af-fect the energy performance of the process,
      namely: the speed of electroarc processing V , voltage U and current density
      j of the electroarc processing. was found that with an in voltage U from to
      55 V and current density j from 3.0 to 3.5 3.5 A/mm 2 , the speed of electrical
      contact processing V increases from 7.7 up to 12.5 mm, which made it possible
      to set for a rational \u2013 average speed of 10.1 mm/s for automatic movement
      of the surface of repair inserts for plowshares relative to the electrode-tool

      unique survey data, I find that the Australian tax code is considerably more
      complex than the OECD average, which is mainly due to overly complex anti-avoidance
      legislation, such as regulations on transfer pricing, general anti-avoidance
      or controlled foreign corporations (CFC). In contrast, Australia''s tax framework,
      which covers processes and fea-tures such as tax law enactment or tax audits,
      is close to the OECD average. A more granular analysis yields further interesting
      insights. For example, excessive details in the tax code and the time between
      the announcement of a tax law change and its enactment turn out to be serious
      issues in Australia relative to the remaining OECD countries.", "venue": "",

      with medical errors in care and evaluation for unstable trauma patients. Our
      study aimed to determine the extent, causes and adverse clinical consequences
      of missed injuries and delayed diagnoses in patients hospitalised with trauma
      in a Turkish Level 3 emergency department, and provide recommendations for emergency
      service workers and supervisors to help them reduce the number of injury diagnoses
      that are delayed. Methods In our prospective study, a total of 515 emergency
      department patients presenting with trauma between 1 July 2014 and 1 July 2015
      were examined by an emergency physician and by a consultant, if necessary. Identified
      injuries were recorded using case forms, and hospitalised patients were discharged
      when their treatment was completed. After the patients were discharged their
      files were reviewed again and new injuries, different from those recorded in
      the case forms, were investigated. Results Of the 515 patients included, it
      was shown that an injury diagnosis had been delayed in 21 (3.9%). Of these injuries,
      65% were related to the musculoskeletal system. Insufficient clinical evaluation
      of 95% of the patients who had a missed injury was identified, and, in 70% of
      missed injuries, the radiology reports had been delayed or incorrectly completed.
      Conclusion We believe that the delayed injury rate can be reduced in trauma
      patients with the use of fast and reliable radiological support and the intervention
      of a multidisciplinary trauma team.", "venue": "Trauma", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      the functioning of services (units) of personnel in the struc- ture of the Armed
      Forces of Ukraine on the basis of their practical activity during 2011-2018
      in the conditions of peacetime and special period and their influence on the
      fulfillment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by purpose. Structural changes of
      the military management bodies by years and the reform of the services (units)
      of personnel from the beginning of the ATO are presented, namely the creation
      of new organizational and staff structures, which were aimed at the formation
      of military management bodies, military units, units for the primary provision
      of protection of citizens and territorial the integrity of the state. In addition,
      the problematic issues, miscalculations and causes that contributed to their
      occurrence are discussed. The main ways of solving these problems and directions
      of activity of services (units) of personnel in the course of their elimina-
      tion are explained. It is analyzed how changes of organizational and staff struc-
      tures of services (units) of personnel, reduction of their number to the indicators
      of minimum and sufficient expediency influenced the efficiency of personnel
      work on accounting issues and formation of rational proposals of efficient use
      of personnel by the team. The expected results of the analysis are presented,
      which can help to resolve the issue of determining the quantitative indicators
      of the regular number of services (units) of personnel of the Armed Forces of
      Ukraine, for timely fulfillment of their staffing, training, support, and use
      of military personnel during the military service. The general conclusions are
      made, which testify to the prevalence of manual mode of implementation of military
      personnel policy in the approaches of forma- tion and determination of quantitative
      indicators of the staff and the list of services (units) of personnel. In this
      context, it is suggested that further research in this area should be directed
      to substantiate approaches to determining the quantitative indi- cators of the

      "title": "From the Quantum to The Macroscopic Level A New Systemic Model for
      Our Complex System", "abstract": "As a Complex System, our body acts as a whole
      system connected to the environmental incitements. It is ordered, coherent,
      tries to maintain the least possible entropy, saving the greatest amount of
      energy. We can observe its active systemic response to environmental information
      both when it is healthy and ill. To explain the dynamics of the systemic regulative
      network a theoretical model is proposed, with a comprehensive approach that
      allows seeing the entire regulative syste m as a continuous unicuum. The paper
      analyzes two points of view: 1) the connections between the quantum level and
      the classical one, through some principles of the QFT and through the Coherence
      Domains. The system is modeled as a field described by the wa ve function, with
      synchronous and consistent events, driven in a global computing by the quantum
      potential Q. The quantum potential implies the non locality, and it needs only
      ultra weak waves to occur, so it explains how the rapid and global activation
      of the organism in response to punctiform information work. The initial hypothesis
      is that some consistent quantum phenomena are amplified through the systemic
      regulative network until they become macroscopic observable. This is possible
      because of Coherence Domains. 2) The reactions of the different systemic networks
      to perturbations/punctiform information, with the first attempt to model and
      measure information in biology, going beyond the Shannon and Turing theories.
      Hopfield Networks and an informational point of view are used to address the
      crucial informational and organizational role of proteins and nucleic acids.
      With this new frame we could develop innovative therapeutic strategies, and
      also evolve new experimental way to make our clinical observation more precise.",

      "Summary Parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates
      calcium level in peripheral circulation by controlling calcium relocation and
      calcium excretion. Hypoparathyroidism is one of the potential complications
      that can occur during thyroid surgery. Hypocalcemia, as a result of hypoparathyroidism,
      can cause severe symptoms, even life-threatening, when not treated properly.
      In this paper, we would like to focus on how to preserve the function of the
      parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery and prevent transient and permanent
      hypoparathyroidism by opting to perform parathyroid autotransplantation. To
      struc ture our suggestion, we divided the article into why, when, and how to
      do the parathyroid autotransplantation?", "venue": "Libri Oncologici Croatian

      the field of natural language generation relied upon formalized grammar systems,
      small-scale statistical models, and lengthy sets of heuristic rules. This older
      technology was fairly limited and brittle: it could remix language into word
      salad poems or chat with humans within narrowly defined topics. Recently, very
      large-scale statistical language models have dramatically advanced the field,
      and GPT-3 is just one example. It can internalize the rules of language without
      explicit programming or rules. Instead, much like a human child, GPT-3 learns
      language through repeated exposure, albeit on a much larger scale. Without explicit
      rules, it can sometimes fail at the simplest of linguistic tasks, but it can
      also excel at more difficult ones like imitating an author or waxing philosophical.",

      and controllable microcomb generation", "abstract": "Microcombs based on Turing
      patterns have been extensively studied in configurations that can be modelled
      by the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Typically, such schemes are implemented experimentally
      by resonant coupling of a continuous wave laser to a Kerr microcavity in order
      to generate highly coherent and robust waves. Here, we study the formation of
      such patterns in a system composed of a microresonator nested in an amplifying
      laser cavity, a scheme recently used to demonstrate laser cavity solitons with
      high optical efficiency and easy repetition rate control. Utilizing this concept,
      we study different regimes of Turing patterns, unveiling their formation dynamics
      and demonstrating their controllability and robustness. By conducting a comprehensive
      modulational instability study with a mean-field model of the system, we explain
      the pattern formation in terms of its evolution from background noise, paving
      the way towards complete self-starting operation. Our theoretical and experimental
      paper provides a clear pathway for repetition rate control of these waves over

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      correlates linearly with the length of Ag 2 Se-CoSe 2 interfaces, determining
      that such Turing-type interfaces are more active sites for OER. Combing X-ray

      deep neural networks, the performance advantage of binarized neural networks
      (BNNs) has merely been showcased on general-purpose processors such as CPUs
      and GPUs. In fact, due to being unable to leverage bit-level-parallelism with
      a word-based architecture, GPUs have been criticized for extremely low utilization
      (1 percent) when executing BNNs. Consequently, the latest tensorcores in NVIDIA
      Turing GPUs start to experimentally support bit computation. In this article,
      we look into this brand new bit computation capability and characterize its
      unique features. We show that the stride of memory access can significantly
      affect performance delivery and a data-format co-design is highly desired to
      support the tensorcores for achieving superior performance than existing software
      solutions without tensorcores. We realize the tensorcore-accelerated BNN design,

      of the primary instability mechanisms useful for studying the transition from

      the Turing and Benjamin\u2013Feir analysis amenable for a wide collection of

      results reveal genesis of Turing instability due to a negative wave number through
      the stability analysis and mean-field method. We obtain the Turing instability
      region in the continuous media system and provide the relationship between degree
      and eigenvalue of the network matrix by the Gershgorin circle theorem. Furthermore,
      the Turing instability condition about nodes and the weights is provided in
      the network-organized system. Additionally, we found chaotic behavior because
      of interactions between I Turing instability and II Turing instability. Besides,
      we apply this above analysis to explaining the mechanism of the signal conduction

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Iterative joints are a hallmark of the tetrapod limb,
      and their positioning is a key step during limb development. Although the molecular
      regulation of joint formation is well studied, it remains unclear what controls
      the location, number and orientation (i.e. the pattern) of joints within each
      digit. Here, we propose the dot-stripe mechanism for joint patterning, comprising
      two coupled Turing systems inspired by published gene expression patterns. Our
      model can explain normal joint morphology in wild-type limbs, hyperphalangy
      in cetacean flippers, mutant phenotypes with misoriented joints and suggests
      a reinterpretation of the polydactylous Ichthyosaur fins as a polygonal joint
      lattice. By formulating a generic dot-stripe model, describing joint patterns
      rather than molecular joint markers, we demonstrate that the insights from the
      model should apply regardless of the biological specifics of the underlying
      mechanism, thus providing a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning
      in the tetrapod limb. Summary: A dot-stripe Turing mechanism can reproduce a
      wide diversity of joint patterns observed in the tetrapod lineage, providing
      a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning in the tetrapod limb.",

      "title": "A hybrid discrete-continuum approach to model Turing pattern formation.",
      "abstract": "Since its introduction in 1952, with a further refinement in 1972
      by Gierer and Meinhardt, Turing''s (pre-)pattern theory (the chemical basis
      of morphogenesis) has been widely applied to a number of areas in developmental
      biology, where evolving cell and tissue structures are naturally observed. The
      related pattern formation models normally comprise a system of reaction-diffusion
      equations for interacting chemical species (morphogens), whose heterogeneous
      distribution in some spatial domain acts as a template for cells to form some
      kind of pattern or structure through, for example, differentiation or proliferation
      induced by the chemical pre-pattern. Here we develop a hybrid discrete-continuum
      modelling framework for the formation of cellular patterns via the Turing mechanism.
      In this framework, a stochastic individual-based model of cell movement and
      proliferation is combined with a reaction-diffusion system for the concentrations
      of some morphogens. As an illustrative example, we focus on a model in which
      the dynamics of the morphogens are governed by an activator-inhibitor system
      that gives rise to Turing pre-patterns. The cells then interact with the morphogens
      in their local area through either of two forms of chemically-dependent cell
      action: Chemotaxis and chemically-controlled proliferation. We begin by considering
      such a hybrid model posed on static spatial domains, and then turn to the case
      of growing domains. In both cases, we formally derive the corresponding deterministic
      continuum limit and show that that there is an excellent quantitative match
      between the spatial patterns produced by the stochastic individual-based model
      and its deterministic continuum counterpart, when sufficiently large numbers
      of cells are considered. This paper is intended to present a proof of concept
      for the ideas underlying the modelling framework, with the aim to then apply
      the related methods to the study of specific patterning and morphogenetic processes
      in the future.", "venue": "Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE",

      is considered, in which it is of interest for the receiver to decide only whether
      a certain message has been sent or not, and the identification-feedback (IDF)
      capacity of channels with feedback is studied. The IDF capacity is shown to
      be discontinuous and super-additive for both deterministic and randomized encoding.
      For the deterministic IDF capacity the phenomenon of super-activation occurs,
      which is the strongest form of super-additivity. This is the first time that
      super-activation is observed for discrete memoryless channels. On the other
      hand, for the randomized IDF capacity, super-activation is not possible. Finally,
      the developed theory is studied from an algorithmic point of view by using the
      framework of Turing computability. The problem of computing the IDF capacity
      on a Turing machine is connected to problems in pure mathematics and it is shown
      that if the IDF capacity would be Turing computable, it would provide solutions
      to other problems in mathematics including Goldbach\u2019s conjecture and the
      Riemann Hypothesis. However, it is shown that the deterministic and randomized

      the Finite State Channel Capacity", "abstract": "The capacity of finite state
      channels (FSCs) has been established as the limit of a sequence of multi-letter
      expressions only and, despite tremendous effort, a corresponding finite-letter
      characterization remains unknown to date. This paper analyzes the capacity of
      FSCs from a fundamental, algorithmic point of view by studying whether or not
      the corresponding achievability and converse bounds on the capacity can be computed
      algorithmically. For this purpose, the concept of Turing machines is used which
      provide the fundamental performance limits of digital computers. To this end,
      computable continuous functions are studied and properties of computable sequences
      of such functions are identified. It is shown that the capacity of FSCs is not
      Banach-Mazur computable which is the weakest form of computability. This implies
      that there is no algorithm (or Turing machine) that can compute the capacity
      of a given FSC. As a consequence, it is then shown that either the achievability
      or converse must yield a bound that is not Banach-Mazur computable. This also
      means that there exist FSCs for which computable lower and upper bounds can
      never be tight. To this end, it is further shown that the capacity of FSCs is
      not approximable, which is an even stricter requirement than non-computability.
      This implies that it is impossible to find a finite-letter entropic characterization
      of the capacity of general FSCs. All results hold even for finite input and
      output alphabets and finite state set. Finally, connections to the theory of
      effective analysis are discussed. Here, results are only allowed to be proved
      in a constructive way, while existence results, e.g., proved based on the axiom
      of choice, are forbidden.", "venue": "Communications in Information and Systems",

      "title": "Turing Computability of Fourier Transforms of Bandlimited and Discrete
      Signals", "abstract": "The Fourier transform is an important operation in signal
      processing. However, its exact computation on digital computers can be problematic.
      In this paper we consider the computability of the Fourier transform and the
      discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT). We construct a computable bandlimited
      absolutely integrable signal that has a continuous Fourier transform, which
      is, however, not Turing computable. Further, we also construct a computable
      sequence such that the DTFT is not Turing computable. Turing computability models
      what is theoretically implementable on a digital computer. Hence, our result
      shows that the Fourier transform of certain signals cannot be computed on digital
      hardware of any kind, including CPUs, FPGAs, and DSPs. This also implies that
      there is no symmetry between the time and frequency domain with respect to computability.
      Therefore, numerical approaches which employ the frequency domain representation
      of a signal (like calculating the convolution by performing a multiplication
      in the frequency domain) can be problematic. Interestingly, an idealized analog
      machine can compute the Fourier transform. However, it is unclear whether and
      how this theoretical superiority of the analog machine can be translated into
      practice. Further, we show that it is not possible to find an algorithm that
      can always decide for a given signal whether the Fourier transform is computable
      or not.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      and manually driven vehicles?", "abstract": "As the number of automated vehicles
      is increasing on our roads, we wanted to know if people could detect if a car
      was being driven by a human driver or automation in a lane change task. This
      is particularly relevant, as most of the road collisions involve automated vehicles
      being struck from behind by manually driven vehicles. To address the detection
      of automated vehicles, an online survey presented videos of lane change maneuvers
      on multi\u2010lane carriageways from behind the automated vehicle. We reasoned
      that, on such roads, the behavior of the vehicles in front would have more of
      an effect on drivers than those of the vehicles behind. To this end, an online
      survey was conducted with 769 people judging 60 video clips, classifying the
      lane change either being performed by Autopilot software or a human driver.
      Over 34,000 responses were recorded. It was found that automated and manual
      lane changes were virtually indistinguishable from the rear of the vehicle.
      The main conclusion of the research was that vehicles in automated mode should
      display this fact to other road users all around the vehicle as this may have
      an effect on other road users in anticipating the behavior of the other vehicle.",

      "title": "Energetic and entropic cost due to overlapping of Turing-Hopf instabilities
      in the presence of cross diffusion.", "abstract": "A systematic introduction
      to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of dynamical instabilities are considered for
      an open nonlinear system beyond conventional Turing pattern in presence of cross
      diffusion. An altered condition of Turing instability in presence of cross diffusion
      is best reflected through a critical control parameter and wave number containing
      both the self- and cross-diffusion coefficients. Our main focus is on entropic
      and energetic cost of Turing-Hopf interplay in stationary pattern formation.
      Depending on the relative dispositions of Turing-Hopf codimensional instabilities
      from the reaction-diffusion equation it clarifies two aspects: energy cost of
      pattern formation, especially how Hopf instability can be utilized to dictate
      a stationary concentration profile, and the possibility of revealing nonequilibrium

      "abstract": "We provide nationally representative estimates of sexual minority
      representation in STEM fields by studying 142,641 men and women in same-sex
      couples from the 2009\u20132018 American Community Surveys. These data indicate
      that men in same-sex couples are 12 percentage points less likely to have completed
      a bachelor\u2019s degree in a STEM field compared to men in different-sex couples.
      On the other hand, there is no gap observed for women in same-sex couples compared
      to women in different-sex couples. The STEM degree gap between men in same-sex
      and different-sex couples is larger than the STEM degree gap between all white
      and black men but is smaller than the gender gap in STEM degrees. We also document
      a smaller but statistically significant gap in STEM occupations between men
      in same-sex and different-sex couples, and we replicate this finding by comparing
      heterosexual and gay men using independently drawn data from the 2013\u20132018
      National Health Interview Surveys. These differences persist after controlling
      for demographic characteristics, location, and fertility. Finally, we document
      that gay male representation in STEM fields (measured using either degrees or
      occupations) is systematically and positively associated with female representation
      in those same STEM fields.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      is a branch of mathematical logic and computer science that has become increasingly
      relevant in recent years. The field has developed growing connections in diverse

      subfields. This book introduces a new hierarchy that allows them to classify
      the combinatorics of constructions from many areas of computability theory,
      including algorithmic randomness, Turing degrees, effectively closed sets, and
      effective structure theory. This unifying hierarchy gives rise to new natural
      definability results for Turing degree classes, demonstrating how dynamic constructions
      become reflected in definability. The book presents numerous construction techniques
      involving high-level nonuniform arguments, and their self-contained work is
      appropriate for graduate students and researchers. Blending traditional and
      modern research results in computability theory, the book establishes novel

      distribution of the human population is distinctly heterogeneous, e.g. showing
      significant difference in the population density between urban and rural areas.
      In the historical perspective, i.e. on the timescale of centuries, the emergence
      of densely populated areas at their present locations is widely believed to
      be linked to more favourable environmental and climatic conditions. In this
      paper, we challenge this point of view. We first identify a few areas at different
      parts of the world where the environmental conditions (quantified by the temperature,
      precipitation and elevation) show a relatively small variation in space on the
      scale of thousands of kilometres. We then examine the population distribution
      across those areas to show that, in spite of the approximate homogeneity of
      the environment, it exhibits a significant variation revealing a nearly periodic
      spatial pattern. Based on this apparent disagreement, we hypothesize that there
      may exist an inherent mechanism that may lead to pattern formation even in a
      uniform environment. We consider a mathematical model of the coupled demographic-economic
      dynamics and show that its spatially uniform, locally stable steady state can
      give rise to a periodic spatial pattern due to the Turing instability, the spatial
      scale of the emerging pattern being consistent with observations. Using numerical
      simulations, we show that, interestingly, the emergence of the Turing patterns
      may eventually lead to the system collapse.", "venue": "Journal of the Royal

      only at the outer edge of each group. First, we analyze the existence and local

      instability occurs with the help of linear stability analysis. Then, using standard

      By numerical simulations, we find that the model exhibits complex pattern replication

      and Cai [18] showed that if MCSP is NP-hard under \"natural\" m-reductions,
      superpolynomial circuit lower bounds for exponential time would follow. This
      has triggered a long line of work on understanding the power of reductions to
      MCSP. Nothing was known so far about consequences of NP-hardness of MCSP under
      general Turing reductions. In this work, we consider two structured kinds of
      Turing reductions: parametric honest reductions and natural reductions. The
      latter generalize the natural reductions of Kabanets and Cai to the case of
      Turing-reductions. We show that NP-hardness of MCSP under these kinds of Turing-reductions

      is known as \u201csystem 0\u201d in the proof below.) The proof I intend to
      give demonstrates that this Turing machine can emulate any twocolor cyclic tag
      system for an infinite number of steps; in order to do this, I first show that
      this Turing machine can emulate any two-color cyclic tag system for an arbitrary
      finite number of steps (with the number of steps encoded in the initial condition),
      and then use this result as a basis for proving the more general result that
      this Turing machine can carry on such an emulation indefinitely. One main problem
      is to ensure that it is the system itself that is doing the calculation, and
      not the case that the universal part of the calculation is complete before the
      initial condition is even constructed. The construction I will give to show
      that system 0 can emulate any two-color cyclic tag system for an arbitrary number
      of steps is quite complex, and it is not immediately obvious that it does not
      itself do the calculation rather than leaving system 0 to do the calculation.
      However, the proofs below leave many options open in the initial conditions
      (there is more than one initial condition that emulates a cyclic tag system),
      and after the rest of the proof I show that at least one of these initial conditions
      can be constructed by a process that is clearly not universal itself.", "venue":

      "The Turing instability is one of the most commonly studied mechanisms leading
      to pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion systems, yet there are still
      many open questions on the applicability of the Turing mechanism. Although experiments
      on pattern formation using chemical systems have shown that temperature differences
      play a role in pattern formation, there is far less theoretical work concerning
      the interplay between temperature and spatial instabilities. We consider a thermodynamically
      extended reaction\u2013diffusion system, consisting of a pair of reaction\u2013diffusion
      equations coupled to an energy equation for temperature, and use this to obtain
      a natural extension of the Turing instability accounting for temperature. We
      show that thermal contributions can restrict or enlarge the set of unstable
      modes possible under the instability, and in some cases may be used to completely
      shift the set of unstable modes, strongly modifying emergent Turing patterns.
      Spatial heterogeneity plays a role under several experimentally feasible configurations,
      and we give particular consideration to scenarios involving thermal gradients,
      thermodynamics of chemicals transported within a flow, and thermodiffusion.
      Control of Turing patterns is also an area of active interest, and we also demonstrate
      how patterns can be modified using time-dependent control of the boundary temperature.",

      on digital computers gives generally only approximations of the continuous solutions.
      It is therefore crucial that the error between the continuous solution and the
      digital approximation can effectively be controlled. This paper investigates
      the possibility of simulating linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems on Turing
      machines. It is shown that there exist elementary LTI systems for which an admissible
      and computable input signal results in a non-computable output signal. For these
      LTI systems, the paper gives sharp characterizations of input spaces such that
      the output is guaranteed to be computable. The second part of the paper discusses
      the computability of the impulse and step response of LTI systems. It is shown
      that the computability of the step response implies not the computability of
      the impulse response. Moreover, there exist impulse responses which cannot be
      computed from the transfer function using the inverse Laplace transform. Finally,
      the paper gives a stronger version of a classical non-computability result,

      Detection", "abstract": "In the classical Turing test, participants are challenged
      to tell whether they are interacting with another human being or with a machine.
      The way the interaction takes place is not direct, but a distant conversation
      through computer screen messages. Basic forms of interaction are face-to-face
      and embodied, context-dependent and based on the detection of reciprocal sensorimotor
      contingencies. Our idea is that interaction detection requires the integration
      of proprioceptive and interoceptive patterns with sensorimotor patterns, within
      quite short time lapses, so that they appear as mutually contingent, as reciprocal.
      In other words, the experience of interaction takes place when sensorimotor
      patterns are contingent upon one\u2019s own movements, and vice versa. I react
      to your movement, you react to mine. When I notice both components, I come to
      experience an interaction. Therefore, we designed a \u201cminimal\u201d Turing
      test to investigate how much information is required to detect these reciprocal
      sensorimotor contingencies. Using a new version of the perceptual crossing paradigm,
      we tested whether participants resorted to interaction detection to tell apart
      human from machine agents in repeated encounters with these agents. In two studies,
      we presented participants with movements of a human agent, either online or
      offline, and movements of a computerized oscillatory agent in three different
      blocks. In each block, either auditory or audiovisual feedback was provided
      along each trial. Analysis of participants\u2019 explicit responses and of the
      implicit information subsumed in the dynamics of their series will reveal evidence
      that participants use the reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies within short
      time windows. For a machine to pass this minimal Turing test, it should be able
      to generate this sort of reciprocal contingencies.", "venue": "Frontiers in

      pattern model is one of the theories used to describe organism formation patterns.
      Using this model, self-organized patterns emerge due to differences in the concentrations
      of activators and inhibitors. Here a cellular automata (CA)-like model was constructed
      wherein the Turing patterns emerged via the exchange of integer values between
      adjacent cells. In this simple hexagonal grid model, each cell state changed
      according to information exchanged from the six adjacent cells. The distinguishing
      characteristic of this model is that it presents a different pattern formation
      mechanism using only one kind of token, such as a chemical agent that ages via
      spatial diffusion. Using this CA-like model, various Turing-like patterns (spots
      or stripes) emerge when changing two of four parameters. This model has the
      ability to support Turing instability that propagates in the neighborhood space;
      global patterns are observed to spread from locally limited patterns. This model
      is not a substitute for a conventional Turing model but rather is a simplified
      Turing model. Using this model, it is possible to control the formation of multiple
      robots into such forms as circle groups or dividing a circle group into two
      groups, for example. In the field of information networks, the presented model

      "Contrary to the classical case, the relation between quantum programming languages
      and quantum Turing Machines (QTM) has not been fully investigated. In particular,
      there are features of QTMs that have not been exploited, a notable example being
      the intrinsic infinite nature of any quantum computation. In this paper, we
      propose a definition of QTM, which extends and unifies the notions of Deutsch
      and Bernstein & Vazirani. In particular, we allow both arbitrary quantum input,
      and meaningful superpositions of computations, where some of them are \u201cterminated\u201d
      with an \u201coutput\u201d, while others are not. For some infinite computations
      an \u201coutput\u201d is obtained as a limit of finite portions of the computation.
      We propose a natural and robust observation protocol for our QTMs, which does
      not modify the probability of the possible outcomes of the machines. Finally,
      we use QTMs to define a class of quantum computable functions\u2014any such
      function is a mapping from a general quantum state to a probability distribution

      "Spontaneous pattern formation is a fundamental scientific problem that has
      received much attention since the seminal theoretical work of Turing on reaction-diffusion
      systems. In molecular biophysics, this phenomenon often takes place under the
      influence of large fluctuations. It is then natural to inquire about the precision
      of such pattern. In particular, spontaneous pattern formation is a nonequilibrium
      phenomenon, and the relation between the precision of a pattern and the thermodynamic
      cost associated with it remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze this relation
      with a paradigmatic stochastic reaction-diffusion model, i.e., the Brusselator
      in one spatial dimension. We find that the precision of the pattern is maximized
      for an intermediate thermodynamic cost, i.e., increasing the thermodynamic cost
      beyond this value makes the pattern less precise. Even though fluctuations get
      less pronounced with an increase in thermodynamic cost, we argue that larger
      fluctuations can also have a positive effect on the precision of the pattern.",

      within the model are found to be associated with a subcritical Turing instability

      translation of calls for accountability and transparency in organisations that
      use AI systems. The report aims to give organisations practical advice to help
      explain the processes, services and decisions delivered or assisted by AI, to
      the individuals affected by them. The guidance is divided into three sections,
      namely: Part 1 The basics of explaining AI; Part 2 Explaining AI in practice;
      and, Part 3 Explaining AI means for an organisation. <br><br>Our paper aims
      to, i. provides commentary on the report, both general and section specific,
      and ii. provides a summary/condensed version of the report itself. Our high-level
      feedback is: <br><br>i. Ope-rationalization: The guidance is directed at practitioners,
      but it is unclear how these can be ope-rationalized; <br><br>ii. Innovation:
      The recommendations of the guidance will affect decisions on model development
      and use. Emphasizing less a family of models (\u2018white-box\u2019) and moving
      towards a stronger principles-based approach would have been beneficial for
      rapid testing and innovation; and, <br><br>iii. Streamline the guidance: there
      is much redundancy in the text, we would recommend streamlining Parts 1 and
      2 and integrating them into a general \u2018explanation of explaining AI systems\u2019
      discussion. Part 3 could be restructured as a mapping of responsibilities in

      the foundations of quantum mechanics, which have now been entirely transcribed
      for the first time. Whereas a lot of the material is rather technical in character,
      many of G\u00f6del''s remarks have a philosophical background and concentrate
      on Leibnizian monadology as well as on vitalism. Obviously influenced by the
      vitalistic writings of Hans Driesch and his \u2018proofs\u2019 for the existence
      of an entelechy in every living organism, G\u00f6del briefly develops the idea
      of a computing machine which closely resembles Turing''s groundbreaking conception.
      After introducing the notebooks on quantum mechanics, this article describes
      G\u00f6del''s vitalistic Weltbild and the ideas leading to the development of
      his computing machine. It investigates a notion of lawlike sequence which closely
      resembles Turing''s concept of a computable number and which G\u00f6del himself
      calls \u2018problematic\u2019, and compares it to the opposed concept of randomness,
      drawing upon the notion of program-size complexity. Finally, G\u00f6del''s machine
      is implemented in a dialect of the Lisp programing language.", "venue": "",

      deep classifiers are intriguingly vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbations:
      single disturbances of small magnitude that lead to misclassification of most
      inputs. This phenomena may potentially result in a serious security problem.
      Despite the extensive research in this area, there is a lack of theoretical
      understanding of the structure of these perturbations. In image domain, there
      is a certain visual similarity between patterns, that represent these perturbations,
      and classical Turing patterns, which appear as a solution of non-linear partial
      differential equations and are underlying concept of many processes in nature.
      In this paper, we provide a theoretical bridge between these two different theories,
      by mapping a simplified algorithm for crafting universal perturbations to (inhomogeneous)
      cellular automata, the latter is known to generate Turing patterns. Furthermore,
      we propose to use Turing patterns, generated by cellular automata, as universal
      perturbations, and experimentally show that they significantly degrade the performance
      of deep learning models. We found this method to be a fast and efficient way
      to create a data-agnostic quasi-imperceptible perturbation in the black-box
      scenario. The source code is available at https://github.com/NurislamT/advTuring.",

      parameters, raising the question of how they may be adopted and realised in
      naturally evolved systems. The vast majority of mathematical studies of Turing
      patterns have used continuous models specified in terms of partial differential
      equations. Here, we complement this work by studying Turing patterns using discrete
      cellular automata models. We perform a large-scale study on all possible two-node
      networks and find the same Turing pattern producing networks as in the continuous
      framework. In contrast to continuous models, however, we find the Turing topologies
      to be substantially more robust to changes in the parameters of the model. We
      also find that Turing instabilities are a much weaker predictor for emerging
      patterns in simulations in our discrete modelling framework. We propose a modification
      of the definition of a Turing instability for cellular automata models as a
      better predictor. The similarity of the results for the two modelling frameworks
      suggests a deeper underlying principle of Turing mechanisms in nature. Together
      with the larger robustness in the discrete case this suggests that Turing patterns
      may be more robust than previously thought.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2020,

      In this paper, we investigated the pattern dynamics of Brusselator from the

      reaction in the random network. After a detailed theoretical analysis, we obtained
      the approximate instability region about the diffusion coefficient and the connection
      probability of the random network. In the meantime, we also obtained the critical
      condition of Turing instability in the network-organized system and found that
      how the network connection probability and diffusion coefficient affect the
      reaction-diffusion system of the Brusselator model. In the end, the reason for
      arising of Turing instability in the Brusselator with the random network was
      explained. Numerical simulation verified the theoretical results.", "venue":

      as central to the understanding of ecological systems more generally, particularly
      relevant to agroecosystems. First is the key insights of Alan Turing in which
      spatial pattern emerges from a system in which there is a reaction between two
      objects, both of which are diffusing in space, a pest and its natural enemy,
      for example. Secondly, as small-scale farmers make complex decisions about their
      farm''s ecosystem management, they are forced to contemplate market forces as
      much as the background ecology. This necessity automatically involves a time
      lag in that remuneration for produce is realized substantially after the decision
      to plant is made. Here, behavioral economics intersects with non-linear ecological
      dynamics to produce an expectation of chaotic patterns. It is suggested that
      these two core ideas, spatial dynamics (e.g., Turing''s dynamic instability
      in space) and chaos (e.g., Simon''s constrained rationality in farm decisions)
      form a qualitative theoretical foundation for understanding the ecology of agroecosystems.",

      with a high mortality rate. Early detection of pulmonary nodules by screening
      with a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan is crucial for its effective clinical
      management. Nodules which are symptomatic of malignancy occupy about 0.0125

      is a tedious task and presents a high risk of human errors. To tackle this problem
      we propose a computationally efficient two stage framework. In the first stage,
      a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained adversarially using Turing test
      loss segments the lung region. In the second stage, patches sampled from the
      segmented region are then classified to detect the presence of nodules. The

      Lower Bounds for Turing Machines", "abstract": "We prove that a sufficiently
      strong parallel repetition theorem for a special case of multiplayer (multiprover)
      games implies super-linear lower bounds for multi-tape Turing machines with
      advice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first connection between parallel
      repetition and lower bounds for time complexity and the first major potential
      implication of a parallel repetition theorem with more than two players. \nAlong
      the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of block rigidity,
      extending Valiant''s notion of rigidity. While rigidity was originally defined
      for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear functions, we extend
      and study both rigidity and block rigidity for general (multi-output) functions.
      Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger, Szemeredi and Trotter, we show that a block-rigid
      function cannot be computed by multi-tape Turing machines that run in linear
      (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the non-uniform setting, where the
      machine gets an arbitrary advice tape. \nWe then describe a class of multiplayer
      games, such that, a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for that
      class of games implies an explicit block-rigid function. The games in that class
      have the following property that may be of independent interest: for every random
      string for the verifier (which, in particular, determines the vector of queries
      to the players), there is a unique correct answer for each of the players, and
      the verifier accepts if and only if all answers are correct. We refer to such
      games as independent games. The theorem that we need is that parallel repetition
      reduces the value of games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\\Omega(n)}$, where
      $n$ is the number of repetitions. \nAs another application of block rigidity,
      we show conditional size-depth tradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates
      compute arbitrary functions over large sets.", "venue": "Electron. Colloquium

      "abstract": "A number of conceptual difficulties arise when considering the
      evolutionary origin of consciousness from the pre-conscious condition. There
      are parallels here with biological pattern formation, where, according to Alan
      Turing\u2019s original formulation of the problem, the statistical properties
      of molecular-level processes serve as a source of incipient pattern. By analogy,
      the evolution of consciousness can be thought of as depending in part on a competition
      between alternative variants in the microstructure of synaptic networks and/or
      the activity patterns they generate, some of which then serve as neural correlates
      of consciousness (NCCs). Assuming that NCCs perform this function only if reliably
      ordered in a particular and precise way, Turing\u2019s formulation provides
      a useful conceptual framework for thinking about how this is achieved developmentally,
      and how changes in neural structure might correlate with change at the level
      of conscious experience. The analysis is largely silent concerning the nature
      and ultimate source of conscious experience, but shows that achieving sentience
      is sufficient to begin the process by which evolution elaborates and shapes
      that first experience. By implication, much of what evolved consciousness achieves
      in adaptive terms can in principle be investigated irrespective of whether or
      not the ultimate source of real-time experience is known or understood. This
      includes the important issue of how precisely NCCs must be structured to ensure
      that each evokes a particular experience as opposed to any other. Some terminological
      issues are clarified, including that of \u201cnoise,\u201d which here refers
      to the statistical variations in neural structure that arise during development,
      not to sensory noise as experienced in real time.", "venue": "Frontiers in Behavioral

      "title": "Widening the criteria for emergence of Turing patterns.", "abstract":
      "The classical concept for emergence of Turing patterns in reaction-diffusion
      systems requires that a system should be composed of complementary subsystems,
      one of which is unstable and diffuses sufficiently slowly while the other one
      is stable and diffuses sufficiently rapidly. In this work, the phenomena of
      emergence of Turing patterns are studied and do not fit into this concept, yielding
      the following results. (1) The criteria are derived, under which a reaction-diffusion
      system with immobile species should spontaneously produce Turing patterns under
      any diffusion coefficients of its mobile species. It is shown for such systems
      that under certain sets of types of interactions between their species, Turing
      patterns should be produced under any parameter values, at least provided that
      the corresponding spatially non-distributed system is stable. (2) It is demonstrated
      that in a reaction-diffusion system, which contains more than two species and
      is stable in absence of diffusion, the presence of a sufficiently slowly diffusing
      unstable subsystem is already sufficient for diffusion instability (i.e., Turing
      or wave instability), while its complementary subsystem can also be unstable.
      (3) It is shown that the presence of an immobile unstable subsystem, which leads
      to destabilization of waves within an infinite range of wavenumbers, in a spatially
      discrete case can result in the generation of large-scale stationary or oscillatory
      patterns. (4) It is demonstrated that under the presence of subcritical Turing
      and supercritical wave bifurcations, the interaction of two diffusion instabilities
      can result in the spontaneous formation of Turing structures outside the region
      of Turing instability.", "venue": "Chaos", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 51,

      that generate symbolic sequences with algorithmic nature may differ in statistical
      complexity because they create structures that follow algorithmic schemes, rather
      than generating symbols from a probabilistic function assuming independence.
      In the case of Turing machines, this means that machines with the same algorithmic
      complexity can create tapes with different statistical complexity. In this paper,
      we use a compression-based approach to measure global and local statistical
      complexity of specific Turing machine tapes with the same number of states and
      alphabet. Both measures are estimated using the best-order Markov model. For
      the global measure, we use the Normalized Compression (NC), while, for the local
      measures, we define and use normal and dynamic complexity profiles to quantify
      and localize lower and higher regions of statistical complexity. We assessed
      the validity of our methodology on synthetic and real genomic data showing that
      it is tolerant to increasing rates of editions and block permutations. Regarding
      the analysis of the tapes, we localize patterns of higher statistical complexity
      in two regions, for a different number of machine states. We show that these
      patterns are generated by a decrease of the tape\u2019s amplitude, given the
      setting of small rule cycles. Additionally, we performed a comparison with a
      measure that uses both algorithmic and statistical approaches (BDM) for analysis
      of the tapes. Naturally, BDM is efficient given the algorithmic nature of the
      tapes. However, for a higher number of states, BDM is progressively approximated
      by our methodology. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm to increase the statistical
      complexity of a Turing machine tape while retaining the same algorithmic complexity.
      We supply a publicly available implementation of the algorithm in C++ language

      "title": "The Pax6 master control gene initiates spontaneous retinal development
      via a self-organising Turing network", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Understanding how
      complex organ systems are assembled from simple embryonic tissues is a major
      challenge. Across the animal kingdom a great diversity of visual organs are
      initiated by a \u2018master control gene\u2019 called Pax6, which is both necessary
      and sufficient for eye development. Yet precisely how Pax6 achieves this deeply
      homologous function is poorly understood. Using the chick as a model organism,
      we show that vertebrate Pax6 interacts with a pair of morphogen-coding genes,
      Tgfb2 and Fst, to form a putative Turing network, which we have computationally
      modelled. Computer simulations suggest that this gene network is sufficient
      to spontaneously polarise the developing retina, establishing the first organisational
      axis of the eye and prefiguring its further development. Our findings reveal
      how retinal self-organisation may be initiated independently of the highly ordered
      tissue interactions that help to assemble the eye in vivo. These results help
      to explain how stem cell aggregates spontaneously self-organise into functional
      eye-cups in vitro. We anticipate these findings will help to underpin retinal
      organoid technology, which holds much promise as a platform for disease modelling,
      drug development and regenerative therapies. Highlighted Article: Pax6 can induce
      ectopic eye development in vivo, while retinal organoids can self-organise in
      vitro. We identify a Pax6 Turing network that could explain both phenomena.",

      and Sublogarithmic-Space Quantum Turing Machines", "abstract": "The two-way
      finite automaton with quantum and classical states (2QCFA), defined by Ambainis
      and Watrous, is a model of quantum computation whose quantum part is extremely
      limited; however, as they showed, 2QCFA are surprisingly powerful: a 2QCFA with
      only a single-qubit can recognize the language $L_{pal}=\\{w \\in \\{a,b\\}^*:w
      \\text{ is a palindrome}\\}$ with bounded error in expected time $2^{O(n)}$,
      on inputs of length $n$. \nWe prove that their result essentially cannot be
      improved upon: a 2QCFA (of any size) cannot recognize $L_{pal}$ with bounded
      error in expected time $2^{o(n)}$. To our knowledge, this is the first example
      of a language that can be recognized with bounded error by a 2QCFA in exponential
      time but not in subexponential time. Moreover, we prove that a quantum Turing
      machine (QTM) running in space $o(\\log n)$ and expected time $2^{n^{1-\\Omega(1)}}$
      cannot recognize $L_{pal}$ with bounded error; again, this is the first lower
      bound of its kind. \nFar more generally, we establish a lower bound on the running
      time of any 2QCFA or $o(\\log n)$-space QTM that recognizes any language $L$
      in terms of a natural ``hardness measure\" of $L$. This allows us to exhibit
      a large family of languages for which we have asymptotically matching lower
      and upper bounds on the running time of any such 2QCFA or QTM recognizer.",

      "Multicellular entities are characterized by exquisite spatial patterns, intimately
      related to the functions they perform. Oftentimes these patterns emerge as periodic
      structures with a well-defined characteristic scale. A candidate mechanism to
      explain their origins was early introduced by Alan Turing through the interaction
      and diffusion of two so called morphogens. Unfortunately, most available evidence
      for Turing patterns in biology is usually obscured by the tangled nature of
      regulatory phenomena, making difficult to validate Turing\u2019s proposal in
      developmental processes. Here we follow a different approach, by designing synthetic
      genetic circuits in engineered E. coli strains that implement the essential
      activator-inhibitor motif (AIM) using a two-cell consortium. The two diffusible
      compartments are one cell type (activator, small-diffusion component) and a
      small signal molecule (a homoserine lactone, acting as the fast-diffusing inhibitor).
      Using both experimental results, we show that the AIM is capable of generating
      diffusion-induced instabilities leading to regular spatial patterns. The artificial
      construction taken here can help validate developmental theories and identify
      universal properties underpinning biological pattern formation. The implications
      of the work for the area of synthetic developmental biology are outlined.",

      introduce a neural stack architecture, including a differentiable parametrized
      stack operator that approximates stack push and pop operations for suitable

      of this stack architecture: after arbitrarily many stack operations, the state
      of the neural stack still closely resembles the state of the discrete stack.
      Using the neural stack with a recurrent neural network, we introduce a neural
      network Pushdown Automaton (nnPDA) and prove that nnPDA with finite/bounded
      neurons and time can simulate any PDA. Furthermore, we extend our construction
      and propose new architecture neural state Turing Machine (nnTM). We prove that
      differentiable nnTM with bounded neurons can simulate Turing Machine (TM) in
      real-time. Just like the neural stack, these architectures are also stable.
      Finally, we extend our construction to show that differentiable nnTM is equivalent
      to Universal Turing Machine (UTM) and can simulate any TM with only \\textbf{seven
      finite/bounded precision} neurons. This work provides a new theoretical bound
      for the computational capability of bounded precision RNNs augmented with memory.",

      the process of representing a statement that one wishes to prove or verify rather
      complicated, as this process requires a new set of equations for each statement.
      Various approaches to deal with this problem have been proposed, see for example
      [1]. We present Cairo, a practically-efficient Turing-complete STARK-friendly
      CPU architecture. We describe a single set of polynomial equations for the statement
      that the execution of a program on this architecture is valid. Given a statement

      While a few attempts to automatic engagement recognition has been studied in
      the literature, learning a robust engagement measure is still a challenging
      task. To address it, we propose a new automatic engagement recognition method
      based on Neural Turing Machine in this paper. In particular, we firstly extract
      student\u2019s eye gaze features, facial action unit features, head pose features,
      and body pose features respectively, then combine these multi modal features
      into the final feature of our recognition task. Moreover, we propose the engagement
      recognition framework based on the idea of Neural Turing Machine to learn the
      weight of each short video feature. In consequence, the feature fused by different
      weights will be applied to identify the students\u2019 engagement in learning

      "abstract": "Previous works have proved that recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
      are Turing-complete. However, in the proofs, the RNNs allow for neurons with
      unbounded precision, which is neither practical in implementation nor biologically
      plausible. To remove this assumption, we propose a dynamically growing memory
      module made of neurons of fixed precision. The memory module dynamically recruits
      new neurons when more memories are needed, and releases them when memories become
      irrelevant. We prove that a 54-neuron bounded-precision RNN with growing memory
      modules can simulate a Universal Turing Machine, with time complexity linear
      in the simulated machine\u2019s time and independent of the memory size. The
      result is extendable to various other stack-augmented RNNs. Furthermore, we
      analyze the Turing completeness of both unbounded-precision and bounded-precision
      RNNs, revisiting and extending the theoretical foundations of RNNs.", "venue":

      from Speech", "abstract": "In real life, people communicate using both speech
      and non-verbal signals such as gestures, face expression or body pose. Non-verbal
      signals impact the meaning of the spoken utterance in an abundance of ways.
      An absence of non-verbal signals impoverishes the process of communication.
      Yet, when users are represented as avatars, it is difficult to translate non-verbal
      signals along with the speech into the virtual world without specialized motion-capture
      hardware. In this paper, we propose a novel, data-driven technique for generating
      gestures directly from speech. Our approach is based on the application of Generative
      Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs) to model the correlation rather than causation
      between speech and gestures. This approach approximates neuroscience findings
      on how non-verbal communication and speech are correlated. We create a large
      dataset which consists of speech and corresponding gestures in a 3D human pose
      format from which our model learns the speaker-specific correlation. We evaluate
      the proposed technique in a user study that is inspired by the Turing test.
      For the study, we animate the generated gestures on a virtual character. We
      find that users are not able to distinguish between the generated and the recorded
      gestures. Moreover, users are able to identify our synthesized gestures as related

      RAM (ORAM) is a machinery that protects any RAM from leaking information about
      its secret input by observing only the access pattern. It is known that every
      ORAM must incur a logarithmic overhead compared to the non-oblivious RAM. In
      fact, even the seemingly weaker notion of di\ufb00erential obliviousness, which
      intuitively \u201cprotects\u201d a single access by guaranteeing that the observed
      access pattern for every two \u201cneighboring\u201d logical access sequences
      satisfy ( (cid:15), \u03b4 )-di\ufb00erential privacy, is subject to a logarithmic
      lower bound. In this work, we show that any Turing machine computation can be
      generically compiled into a di\ufb00erentially oblivious one with only doubly
      logarithmic overhead. More precisely, given a Turing machine that makes N transitions,
      the compiled Turing machine makes O ( N \u00b7 log log N ) transitions in total
      and the physical head movements sequence satis\ufb01es ( (cid:15), \u03b4 )-di\ufb00erential
      privacy (for a constant (cid:15) and a negligible \u03b4 ). We additionally
      show that \u2126(log log N ) overhead is necessary in a natural range of parameters
      (and in the balls and bins model). As a corollary, we show that there exist
      natural data structures such as stack and queues (supporting online operations)
      on N elements for which there is a di\ufb00erentially oblivious implementation
      on a Turing machine incurring amortized O (log log N ) overhead per operation,
      while it is known that any oblivious implementation must consume \u2126(log
      N ) operations un-conditionally even on a RAM. Therefore, we obtain the \ufb01rst
      unconditional separation between obliviousness and di\ufb00erential obliviousness
      in the most natural setting of parameters where (cid:15) is a constant and \u03b4
      is negligible. Before this work, such a separation was only known in the balls

      the DR equations and the Hamiltonian for MC, the Finsler metric is introduced

      appear according to a constraint given by some external forces applied to the
      internal degrees of freedom. In this FG modeling technique, direction-dependent
      diffusion constants are unnecessary, and these constants automatically or effectively
      become anisotropic. We consider that the internal degrees of freedom introduced

      laser cavity, a scheme recently used to demonstrate laser cavity solitons with
      high optical efficiency and easy repetition rate control. Utilizing this concept,
      we study different regimes of Turing patterns, unveiling their formation dynamics
      and demonstrating their controllability and robustness. By conducting a comprehensive
      modulational instability study with a mean-field model of the system, we explain
      the pattern formation in terms of its evolution from background noise, paving
      the way towards complete self-starting operation. Our theoretical and experimental
      paper provides a clear pathway for repetition rate control of these waves over
      both fine (Megahertz) and large (Gigahertz) scales, featuring a fractional frequency
      nonuniformity better than 7 \u00d7 10\u221214 with a 100-ms time gate and without
      the need for active stabilization.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "The non-existence of polynomial kernels for ORand AND-compositional problems
      is now a wellestablished result. Some of these problems have adaptive or non-adaptive
      polynomial Turing kernels. Up to now, most known polynomial Turing kernels are
      non-adaptive and most of them are of the conjunctive or disjunctive kind. For
      some problems it has been conjectured that the existence of polynomial Turing
      kernels is unlikely. For instance, either all or none of the WK[1]-complete
      problems have polynomial Turing kernels. While it has been conjectured that
      they do not, a proof tying their non-existence to some complexity theoretic
      assumption is still missing and seems to be beyond the reach of today\u2019s
      standard techniques. In this paper, we prove that OR-compositional problems
      and all WK[1]-hard problems do not have conjunctive polynomial kernels, a special
      type of non-adaptive Turing kernels, under the assumption that coNP \u2288 NP/poly.
      Similarly, it is unlikely that AND-compositional problems have disjunctive polynomial
      kernels. Moreover, we present a way to prove that the parameterized versions
      of some \u2295P -hard problems, for instance, Odd Path on planar graphs, do
      not have conjunctive or disjunctive polynomial kernels, unless coNP \u2286 NP/poly.
      Finally, we identify a problem that is unlikely to have either a conjunctive
      or disjunctive polynomial kernel, unless coNP \u2286 NP/poly, due to a reduction
      from an NP-hard problem instead: Weighted Odd Path on planar graphs. 2012 ACM

      GPUs", "abstract": "Despite foreseeing tremendous speedups over conventional
      deep neural networks, the performance advantage of binarized neural networks
      (BNNs) has merely been showcased on general-purpose processors such as CPUs
      and GPUs. In fact, due to being unable to leverage bit-level-parallelism with
      a word-based architecture, GPUs have been criticized for extremely low utilization
      (1 percent) when executing BNNs. Consequently, the latest tensorcores in NVIDIA
      Turing GPUs start to experimentally support bit computation. In this article,
      we look into this brand new bit computation capability and characterize its
      unique features. We show that the stride of memory access can significantly
      affect performance delivery and a data-format co-design is highly desired to
      support the tensorcores for achieving superior performance than existing software
      solutions without tensorcores. We realize the tensorcore-accelerated BNN design,
      particularly the major functions for fully-connect and convolution layers \u2014
      bit matrix multiplication and bit convolution. Evaluations on two NVIDIA Turing
      GPUs show that, with ResNet-18, our BTC-BNN design can process ImageNet at a
      rate of 5.6K images per second, 77 percent faster than state-of-the-art. Our

      "title": "Finding the condition of Turing instabilities", "abstract": "As exemplified
      in leopard\u2019s coat and zebra stripe, temporally stable and spatially inhomogeneous
      steady state patterns are ubiquitous in the animal body [1]. Manifestation of
      such patterns is also a fundamental basis of embryogenesis, which constitutes
      a series of collective symmetry-breaking events among effectively identical
      cells at the early stage of development. In his seminal paper entitled \u201cThe
      chemical basis of morphogenesis,\u201d Alan Turing put forward a simple reaction-diffusion
      based mechanism, widely known as the diffusion-induced instability or Turing
      instability, to account for the formation of biological patterns [2]. Inhomogeneous
      steady state concentration profiles of diffusible signaling molecules, termed
      \u2018morphogens,\u2019 was hypothesized to induce differential gene expressions
      across a collection of cells and formation of biological patterns. Specifically,
      Turing proposed that interplay between two types of morphogens, autocatalytic
      activators and inhibitors, diffusing across the cells, can self-organize to
      generate spatial inhomogeneous periodic concentration profiles of the morphogens.
      In general terms without resorting to a specific model, the spatiotemporal dynamics
      of N -interacting morphogens is explained using the reaction-diffusion equation
      with an appropriate boundary condition, \u010b = f(c) + D \u00b7\u2207c, where
      c is the concentrations of morphogens, c = c(r, t) \u2261 (c1(r, t), c2(r, t),
      . . . cN(r, t)), f(c) \u2261 (f1(c), f2(c), . . . , fN(c)) represents a set
      of nonlinear functions of the concentrations c, and D is the diffusion matrix.
      The dynamical properties of the solution c(r, t) at steady states are assessed
      by performing a stability analysis of a linearized equation around the fixed
      point c\u2217 that satisfies f(c\u2217) = 0. At c '' c\u2217+\u03b4c (|\u03b4ci/ci
      | 1 for all i), the equation is linearized to: \u2202t\u03b4c = J \u00b7 \u03b4c

      "title": "Twenty Years Beyond the Turing Test Moving Beyond the Human Judges
      Too", "abstract": "In the last twenty years the Turing test has been left further
      behind by new developments in artificial intelligence. At the same time, however,
      these developments have revived some key elements of the Turing test: imitation
      and adversar-ialness. On the one hand, many generative models, such as generative
      adversarial networks (GAN), build imitators under an adversarial setting that
      strongly resembles the Turing test (with the judge being a learnt discriminative
      model). The term \u201cTuring learning\u201d has been used for this kind of
      setting. On the other hand, AI benchmarks are suffering an adversarial situation
      too, with a \u2018challenge-solve-and-replace\u2019 evaluation dynamics whenever
      human performance is \u2018imitated\u2019. The particular AI community rushes
      to replace the old benchmark by a more challenging benchmark, one for which
      human performance would still be beyond AI. These two phenomena re-lated to
      the Turing test are sufficiently distinctive, important and general for a detailed
      analysis. This is the main goal of this paper. After recognising the abyss that
      appears beyond superhuman performance, we build on Turing learning to identify
      two different evaluation schemas: Turing testing and adversarial testing. We
      revisit some of the key questions surrounding the Turing test, such as \u2018understanding\u2019,
      commonsense reasoning and extracting meaning from the world, and explore how
      the new testing paradigms should work to unmask the limitations of current and
      future AI. Finally, we discuss how behavioural similarity metrics could be used
      to create taxonomies for artificial and natural intelligence. Both testing schemas
      should complete a transition in which humans should give way to machines \u2014not
      only as references to be imitated but also as judges\u2014 when pursuing and

      "Can machines think? So Alan Turing begins his paper \"Computing Machinery and
      Intelligence\", discussing how one might assess whether an electronic computer
      can truly \"think\" (Turing, 1950, p. 29). It is here that Turing explains his
      famous Turing Test: can a computer win in an \"imitation game\" with a human?
      That is, can an electronic computer provide written answers to an interrogator
      which would fool the interrogator into believing that device is human? To answer
      yes, Turing argues, is to acknowledge the reality of a thinking machine (Turing,
      1950, p. 30). Since 1950, technology has advanced impressively. There has been
      a computer that \u201cpassed\u201d the Turing Test, fooling testers with a clever
      ability to redirect conversation when questions became too challenging (Marcus,
      2014). Yet this strategy feels more like a cheap trick than the mark of an authentic
      thinker, casting doubt on the test\u2019s validity. What could be a more reliable
      test for machine understanding? I argue for two simple additions to the Turing
      Test that would eliminate loopholes but leave the spirit of the test unchanged.
      That Turing''s original imagination of the Turing Test involved a game of deception
      is distracting to its fundamental principle: we will say a machine \u201cthinks\u201d
      when its logical outputs are in no way noticeably inferior to that of a human.",

      among the machines, Turing challenged the conventional wisdom of what machines
      really were or could be and prophesized a future pervaded by intelligent machines

      what future did Turing actually envision and propose to machines? I will formulate
      and study the problem of identifying Turing\u2019s specific Promethean ambition
      about intelligent machines. I shall suggest that Turing\u2019s primary aim was
      the development of mechanistic explanations of the human mindbrain. But his
      secondary aim, implied in irony and wit, was the delivery of a social criticism
      about gender, race, nation and species chauvinisms. Turing\u2019s association
      with Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein will be discouraged. Rather, his third
      aim was to send a precautionary message about the possibility of machines outstripping

      homogeneous states to heterogeneous spatial or spatio-temporal states in reaction\u2013diffusion

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Iterative joints are a hallmark of the tetrapod limb,
      and their positioning is a key step during limb development. Although the molecular
      regulation of joint formation is well studied, it remains unclear what controls
      the location, number and orientation (i.e. the pattern) of joints within each
      digit. Here, we propose the dot-stripe mechanism for joint patterning, comprising
      two coupled Turing systems inspired by published gene expression patterns. Our
      model can explain normal joint morphology in wild-type limbs, hyperphalangy
      in cetacean flippers, mutant phenotypes with misoriented joints and suggests
      a reinterpretation of the polydactylous Ichthyosaur fins as a polygonal joint
      lattice. By formulating a generic dot-stripe model, describing joint patterns
      rather than molecular joint markers, we demonstrate that the insights from the
      model should apply regardless of the biological specifics of the underlying
      mechanism, thus providing a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning
      in the tetrapod limb. Summary: A dot-stripe Turing mechanism can reproduce a
      wide diversity of joint patterns observed in the tetrapod lineage, providing
      a unifying framework to interrogate joint patterning in the tetrapod limb.",

      "title": "A hybrid discrete-continuum approach to model Turing pattern formation.",
      "abstract": "Since its introduction in 1952, with a further refinement in 1972
      by Gierer and Meinhardt, Turing''s (pre-)pattern theory (the chemical basis
      of morphogenesis) has been widely applied to a number of areas in developmental
      biology, where evolving cell and tissue structures are naturally observed. The
      related pattern formation models normally comprise a system of reaction-diffusion
      equations for interacting chemical species (morphogens), whose heterogeneous
      distribution in some spatial domain acts as a template for cells to form some
      kind of pattern or structure through, for example, differentiation or proliferation
      induced by the chemical pre-pattern. Here we develop a hybrid discrete-continuum
      modelling framework for the formation of cellular patterns via the Turing mechanism.
      In this framework, a stochastic individual-based model of cell movement and
      proliferation is combined with a reaction-diffusion system for the concentrations
      of some morphogens. As an illustrative example, we focus on a model in which
      the dynamics of the morphogens are governed by an activator-inhibitor system
      that gives rise to Turing pre-patterns. The cells then interact with the morphogens
      in their local area through either of two forms of chemically-dependent cell
      action: Chemotaxis and chemically-controlled proliferation. We begin by considering
      such a hybrid model posed on static spatial domains, and then turn to the case
      of growing domains. In both cases, we formally derive the corresponding deterministic
      continuum limit and show that that there is an excellent quantitative match
      between the spatial patterns produced by the stochastic individual-based model
      and its deterministic continuum counterpart, when sufficiently large numbers
      of cells are considered. This paper is intended to present a proof of concept
      for the ideas underlying the modelling framework, with the aim to then apply
      the related methods to the study of specific patterning and morphogenetic processes

      is considered, in which it is of interest for the receiver to decide only whether
      a certain message has been sent or not, and the identification-feedback (IDF)
      capacity of channels with feedback is studied. The IDF capacity is shown to
      be discontinuous and super-additive for both deterministic and randomized encoding.
      For the deterministic IDF capacity the phenomenon of super-activation occurs,
      which is the strongest form of super-additivity. This is the first time that
      super-activation is observed for discrete memoryless channels. On the other
      hand, for the randomized IDF capacity, super-activation is not possible. Finally,
      the developed theory is studied from an algorithmic point of view by using the
      framework of Turing computability. The problem of computing the IDF capacity
      on a Turing machine is connected to problems in pure mathematics and it is shown
      that if the IDF capacity would be Turing computable, it would provide solutions
      to other problems in mathematics including Goldbach\u2019s conjecture and the
      Riemann Hypothesis. However, it is shown that the deterministic and randomized
      IDF capacities are not Banach-Mazur computable. This is the weakest form of
      computability implying that the IDF capacity is not computable even for universal

      processing. However, its exact computation on digital computers can be problematic.
      In this paper we consider the computability of the Fourier transform and the
      discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT). We construct a computable bandlimited
      absolutely integrable signal that has a continuous Fourier transform, which
      is, however, not Turing computable. Further, we also construct a computable
      sequence such that the DTFT is not Turing computable. Turing computability models
      what is theoretically implementable on a digital computer. Hence, our result
      shows that the Fourier transform of certain signals cannot be computed on digital
      hardware of any kind, including CPUs, FPGAs, and DSPs. This also implies that
      there is no symmetry between the time and frequency domain with respect to computability.
      Therefore, numerical approaches which employ the frequency domain representation
      of a signal (like calculating the convolution by performing a multiplication
      in the frequency domain) can be problematic. Interestingly, an idealized analog
      machine can compute the Fourier transform. However, it is unclear whether and
      how this theoretical superiority of the analog machine can be translated into
      practice. Further, we show that it is not possible to find an algorithm that
      can always decide for a given signal whether the Fourier transform is computable
      or not.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      the Finite State Channel Capacity", "abstract": "The capacity of finite state
      channels (FSCs) has been established as the limit of a sequence of multi-letter
      expressions only and, despite tremendous effort, a corresponding finite-letter
      characterization remains unknown to date. This paper analyzes the capacity of
      FSCs from a fundamental, algorithmic point of view by studying whether or not
      the corresponding achievability and converse bounds on the capacity can be computed
      algorithmically. For this purpose, the concept of Turing machines is used which
      provide the fundamental performance limits of digital computers. To this end,
      computable continuous functions are studied and properties of computable sequences
      of such functions are identified. It is shown that the capacity of FSCs is not
      Banach-Mazur computable which is the weakest form of computability. This implies
      that there is no algorithm (or Turing machine) that can compute the capacity
      of a given FSC. As a consequence, it is then shown that either the achievability
      or converse must yield a bound that is not Banach-Mazur computable. This also
      means that there exist FSCs for which computable lower and upper bounds can
      never be tight. To this end, it is further shown that the capacity of FSCs is
      not approximable, which is an even stricter requirement than non-computability.
      This implies that it is impossible to find a finite-letter entropic characterization
      of the capacity of general FSCs. All results hold even for finite input and
      output alphabets and finite state set. Finally, connections to the theory of
      effective analysis are discussed. Here, results are only allowed to be proved
      in a constructive way, while existence results, e.g., proved based on the axiom
      of choice, are forbidden.", "venue": "Communications in Information and Systems",

      and manually driven vehicles?", "abstract": "As the number of automated vehicles
      is increasing on our roads, we wanted to know if people could detect if a car
      was being driven by a human driver or automation in a lane change task. This
      is particularly relevant, as most of the road collisions involve automated vehicles
      being struck from behind by manually driven vehicles. To address the detection
      of automated vehicles, an online survey presented videos of lane change maneuvers
      on multi\u2010lane carriageways from behind the automated vehicle. We reasoned
      that, on such roads, the behavior of the vehicles in front would have more of
      an effect on drivers than those of the vehicles behind. To this end, an online
      survey was conducted with 769 people judging 60 video clips, classifying the
      lane change either being performed by Autopilot software or a human driver.
      Over 34,000 responses were recorded. It was found that automated and manual
      lane changes were virtually indistinguishable from the rear of the vehicle.
      The main conclusion of the research was that vehicles in automated mode should
      display this fact to other road users all around the vehicle as this may have
      an effect on other road users in anticipating the behavior of the other vehicle.",

      Evaluation on Turing Machines", "abstract": "Modern communication systems need
      to satisfy pre-specified requirements on spectral efficiency and security. Physical
      layer security is a concept that unifies both and connects them with entropic
      quantities. In this paper, a framework based on Turing machines is developed
      to address the question of deciding whether or not a communication system meets
      these requirements. It is known that the class of Turing solvable problems coincides
      with the class of algorithmically solvable problems so that this framework provides
      the theoretical basis for effective verification of such performance requirements.
      A key issue here is to decide whether or not the performance functions, i.e.,
      capacities, of relevant communication scenarios, particularly those with secrecy
      requirements and active adversaries, are Turing computable. This is a necessary
      condition for the corresponding communication protocols to be effectively verifiable.
      Within this framework, it is then shown that for certain scenarios including
      the wiretap channel the corresponding capacities are Turing computable. Next,
      a general necessary condition on the performance function for Turing computability
      is established. With this, it is shown that for certain scenarios, including
      the wiretap channel with an active jammer, the performance functions are not
      computable when deterministic codes are used. As a consequence, such performance
      functions are also not computable on all other computer architectures such as
      the von Neumann-architecture or the register machines.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions

      to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of dynamical instabilities are considered for
      an open nonlinear system beyond conventional Turing pattern in presence of cross
      diffusion. An altered condition of Turing instability in presence of cross diffusion
      is best reflected through a critical control parameter and wave number containing
      both the self- and cross-diffusion coefficients. Our main focus is on entropic
      and energetic cost of Turing-Hopf interplay in stationary pattern formation.
      Depending on the relative dispositions of Turing-Hopf codimensional instabilities
      from the reaction-diffusion equation it clarifies two aspects: energy cost of
      pattern formation, especially how Hopf instability can be utilized to dictate
      a stationary concentration profile, and the possibility of revealing nonequilibrium
      phase transition. In the Brusselator model, to understand these phenomena, we
      have analyzed through the relevant complex Ginzberg-Landau equation using multiscale
      Krylov-Bogolyubov averaging method. Due to Hopf instability it is observed that
      the cross-diffusion parameters can be a source of huge change in free-energy

      On the other hand, there is no gap observed for women in same-sex couples compared
      to women in different-sex couples. The STEM degree gap between men in same-sex
      and different-sex couples is larger than the STEM degree gap between all white
      and black men but is smaller than the gender gap in STEM degrees. We also document
      a smaller but statistically significant gap in STEM occupations between men
      in same-sex and different-sex couples, and we replicate this finding by comparing
      heterosexual and gay men using independently drawn data from the 2013\u20132018
      National Health Interview Surveys. These differences persist after controlling
      for demographic characteristics, location, and fertility. Finally, we document

      is a branch of mathematical logic and computer science that has become increasingly
      relevant in recent years. The field has developed growing connections in diverse
      areas of mathematics, with applications in topology, group theory, and other
      subfields. This book introduces a new hierarchy that allows them to classify
      the combinatorics of constructions from many areas of computability theory,
      including algorithmic randomness, Turing degrees, effectively closed sets, and
      effective structure theory. This unifying hierarchy gives rise to new natural
      definability results for Turing degree classes, demonstrating how dynamic constructions
      become reflected in definability. The book presents numerous construction techniques
      involving high-level nonuniform arguments, and their self-contained work is
      appropriate for graduate students and researchers. Blending traditional and
      modern research results in computability theory, the book establishes novel
      directions in the field.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

      distribution of the human population is distinctly heterogeneous, e.g. showing
      significant difference in the population density between urban and rural areas.
      In the historical perspective, i.e. on the timescale of centuries, the emergence
      of densely populated areas at their present locations is widely believed to
      be linked to more favourable environmental and climatic conditions. In this
      paper, we challenge this point of view. We first identify a few areas at different
      parts of the world where the environmental conditions (quantified by the temperature,
      precipitation and elevation) show a relatively small variation in space on the
      scale of thousands of kilometres. We then examine the population distribution
      across those areas to show that, in spite of the approximate homogeneity of
      the environment, it exhibits a significant variation revealing a nearly periodic
      spatial pattern. Based on this apparent disagreement, we hypothesize that there
      may exist an inherent mechanism that may lead to pattern formation even in a
      uniform environment. We consider a mathematical model of the coupled demographic-economic
      dynamics and show that its spatially uniform, locally stable steady state can
      give rise to a periodic spatial pattern due to the Turing instability, the spatial
      scale of the emerging pattern being consistent with observations. Using numerical
      simulations, we show that, interestingly, the emergence of the Turing patterns
      may eventually lead to the system collapse.", "venue": "Journal of the Royal

      of a problem that is neither known to be in P nor known to be NP-hard. Kabanets
      and Cai [18] showed that if MCSP is NP-hard under \"natural\" m-reductions,
      superpolynomial circuit lower bounds for exponential time would follow. This
      has triggered a long line of work on understanding the power of reductions to
      MCSP. Nothing was known so far about consequences of NP-hardness of MCSP under
      general Turing reductions. In this work, we consider two structured kinds of
      Turing reductions: parametric honest reductions and natural reductions. The
      latter generalize the natural reductions of Kabanets and Cai to the case of
      Turing-reductions. We show that NP-hardness of MCSP under these kinds of Turing-reductions

      the pack predation-herd behavior, the predator\u2013prey interaction occurs
      only at the outer edge of each group. First, we analyze the existence and local
      stability of the equilibria of temporal model using vector field analysis and
      characteristic equations. Second, we deduce the conditions under which Turing
      instability occurs with the help of linear stability analysis. Then, using standard
      multiple-scale analysis, we derive the amplitude equations for the excited modes.
      By numerical simulations, we find that the model exhibits complex pattern replication

      is known as \u201csystem 0\u201d in the proof below.) The proof I intend to
      give demonstrates that this Turing machine can emulate any twocolor cyclic tag
      system for an infinite number of steps; in order to do this, I first show that
      this Turing machine can emulate any two-color cyclic tag system for an arbitrary
      finite number of steps (with the number of steps encoded in the initial condition),
      and then use this result as a basis for proving the more general result that
      this Turing machine can carry on such an emulation indefinitely. One main problem
      is to ensure that it is the system itself that is doing the calculation, and
      not the case that the universal part of the calculation is complete before the
      initial condition is even constructed. The construction I will give to show
      that system 0 can emulate any two-color cyclic tag system for an arbitrary number
      of steps is quite complex, and it is not immediately obvious that it does not
      itself do the calculation rather than leaving system 0 to do the calculation.
      However, the proofs below leave many options open in the initial conditions
      (there is more than one initial condition that emulates a cyclic tag system),
      and after the rest of the proof I show that at least one of these initial conditions
      can be constructed by a process that is clearly not universal itself.", "venue":

      on digital computers gives generally only approximations of the continuous solutions.
      It is therefore crucial that the error between the continuous solution and the
      digital approximation can effectively be controlled. This paper investigates
      the possibility of simulating linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems on Turing
      machines. It is shown that there exist elementary LTI systems for which an admissible
      and computable input signal results in a non-computable output signal. For these
      LTI systems, the paper gives sharp characterizations of input spaces such that
      the output is guaranteed to be computable. The second part of the paper discusses
      the computability of the impulse and step response of LTI systems. It is shown
      that the computability of the step response implies not the computability of
      the impulse response. Moreover, there exist impulse responses which cannot be
      computed from the transfer function using the inverse Laplace transform. Finally,
      the paper gives a stronger version of a classical non-computability result,
      showing that there exist admissible and computable initial values for the wave
      equation so that the solution cannot be computed at certain points in space

      "The Turing instability is one of the most commonly studied mechanisms leading
      to pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion systems, yet there are still
      many open questions on the applicability of the Turing mechanism. Although experiments
      on pattern formation using chemical systems have shown that temperature differences
      play a role in pattern formation, there is far less theoretical work concerning
      the interplay between temperature and spatial instabilities. We consider a thermodynamically
      extended reaction\u2013diffusion system, consisting of a pair of reaction\u2013diffusion
      equations coupled to an energy equation for temperature, and use this to obtain
      a natural extension of the Turing instability accounting for temperature. We
      show that thermal contributions can restrict or enlarge the set of unstable
      modes possible under the instability, and in some cases may be used to completely
      shift the set of unstable modes, strongly modifying emergent Turing patterns.
      Spatial heterogeneity plays a role under several experimentally feasible configurations,
      and we give particular consideration to scenarios involving thermal gradients,
      thermodynamics of chemicals transported within a flow, and thermodiffusion.
      Control of Turing patterns is also an area of active interest, and we also demonstrate
      how patterns can be modified using time-dependent control of the boundary temperature.",

      pattern model is one of the theories used to describe organism formation patterns.
      Using this model, self-organized patterns emerge due to differences in the concentrations
      of activators and inhibitors. Here a cellular automata (CA)-like model was constructed
      wherein the Turing patterns emerged via the exchange of integer values between
      adjacent cells. In this simple hexagonal grid model, each cell state changed
      according to information exchanged from the six adjacent cells. The distinguishing
      characteristic of this model is that it presents a different pattern formation
      mechanism using only one kind of token, such as a chemical agent that ages via
      spatial diffusion. Using this CA-like model, various Turing-like patterns (spots
      or stripes) emerge when changing two of four parameters. This model has the
      ability to support Turing instability that propagates in the neighborhood space;
      global patterns are observed to spread from locally limited patterns. This model
      is not a substitute for a conventional Turing model but rather is a simplified
      Turing model. Using this model, it is possible to control the formation of multiple
      robots into such forms as circle groups or dividing a circle group into two
      groups, for example. In the field of information networks, the presented model
      could be applied to groups of Internet-of-Things devices to create macroscopic
      spatial structures to control data traffic.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

      "title": "A Minimal Turing Test: Reciprocal Sensorimotor Contingencies for Interaction
      Detection", "abstract": "In the classical Turing test, participants are challenged
      to tell whether they are interacting with another human being or with a machine.
      The way the interaction takes place is not direct, but a distant conversation
      through computer screen messages. Basic forms of interaction are face-to-face
      and embodied, context-dependent and based on the detection of reciprocal sensorimotor
      contingencies. Our idea is that interaction detection requires the integration
      of proprioceptive and interoceptive patterns with sensorimotor patterns, within
      quite short time lapses, so that they appear as mutually contingent, as reciprocal.
      In other words, the experience of interaction takes place when sensorimotor
      patterns are contingent upon one\u2019s own movements, and vice versa. I react
      to your movement, you react to mine. When I notice both components, I come to
      experience an interaction. Therefore, we designed a \u201cminimal\u201d Turing
      test to investigate how much information is required to detect these reciprocal
      sensorimotor contingencies. Using a new version of the perceptual crossing paradigm,
      we tested whether participants resorted to interaction detection to tell apart
      human from machine agents in repeated encounters with these agents. In two studies,
      we presented participants with movements of a human agent, either online or
      offline, and movements of a computerized oscillatory agent in three different
      blocks. In each block, either auditory or audiovisual feedback was provided
      along each trial. Analysis of participants\u2019 explicit responses and of the
      implicit information subsumed in the dynamics of their series will reveal evidence
      that participants use the reciprocal sensorimotor contingencies within short
      time windows. For a machine to pass this minimal Turing test, it should be able
      to generate this sort of reciprocal contingencies.", "venue": "Frontiers in

      "Spontaneous pattern formation is a fundamental scientific problem that has
      received much attention since the seminal theoretical work of Turing on reaction-diffusion
      systems. In molecular biophysics, this phenomenon often takes place under the
      influence of large fluctuations. It is then natural to inquire about the precision
      of such pattern. In particular, spontaneous pattern formation is a nonequilibrium
      phenomenon, and the relation between the precision of a pattern and the thermodynamic
      cost associated with it remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze this relation
      with a paradigmatic stochastic reaction-diffusion model, i.e., the Brusselator
      in one spatial dimension. We find that the precision of the pattern is maximized
      for an intermediate thermodynamic cost, i.e., increasing the thermodynamic cost
      beyond this value makes the pattern less precise. Even though fluctuations get
      less pronounced with an increase in thermodynamic cost, we argue that larger
      fluctuations can also have a positive effect on the precision of the pattern.",

      "Contrary to the classical case, the relation between quantum programming languages
      and quantum Turing Machines (QTM) has not been fully investigated. In particular,
      there are features of QTMs that have not been exploited, a notable example being
      the intrinsic infinite nature of any quantum computation. In this paper, we
      propose a definition of QTM, which extends and unifies the notions of Deutsch
      and Bernstein & Vazirani. In particular, we allow both arbitrary quantum input,
      and meaningful superpositions of computations, where some of them are \u201cterminated\u201d
      with an \u201coutput\u201d, while others are not. For some infinite computations
      an \u201coutput\u201d is obtained as a limit of finite portions of the computation.
      We propose a natural and robust observation protocol for our QTMs, which does
      not modify the probability of the possible outcomes of the machines. Finally,
      we use QTMs to define a class of quantum computable functions\u2014any such
      function is a mapping from a general quantum state to a probability distribution

      use AI systems. The report aims to give organisations practical advice to help
      explain the processes, services and decisions delivered or assisted by AI, to
      the individuals affected by them. The guidance is divided into three sections,

      and, Part 3 Explaining AI means for an organisation. <br><br>Our paper aims
      to, i. provides commentary on the report, both general and section specific,
      and ii. provides a summary/condensed version of the report itself. Our high-level
      feedback is: <br><br>i. Ope-rationalization: The guidance is directed at practitioners,
      but it is unclear how these can be ope-rationalized; <br><br>ii. Innovation:
      The recommendations of the guidance will affect decisions on model development
      and use. Emphasizing less a family of models (\u2018white-box\u2019) and moving
      towards a stronger principles-based approach would have been beneficial for
      rapid testing and innovation; and, <br><br>iii. Streamline the guidance: there
      is much redundancy in the text, we would recommend streamlining Parts 1 and
      2 and integrating them into a general \u2018explanation of explaining AI systems\u2019
      discussion. Part 3 could be restructured as a mapping of responsibilities in
      the explanation matrix and roles in an organisation, including a hierarchy of

      language models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in various natural language
      processing domains by adapting to downstream tasks via zero-shot, few-shot and
      fine-tuning techniques. Because of their success, the size of these models has
      increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic
      techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort
      between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest
      monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG),
      with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure
      as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed
      and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
      corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
      to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results,
      as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
      We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
      accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.
      We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale

      was intelligent: could a machine imitate a human so well that its answers to
      questions were indistinguishable from a human''s? Ever since, creating intelligence
      that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of
      thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like
      artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure,
      and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our own minds. But not
      all types of AI are human-like-in fact, many of the most powerful systems are
      very different from humans-and an excessive focus on developing and deploying
      HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human
      labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly
      dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused
      on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to
      insist on a share of the value created. What is more, augmentation creates new
      capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value
      than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial,
      there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation
      among technologists, business executives, and policy-makers.", "venue": "Daedalus",

      Large language models (LLMs) have been transformative. They are pretrained foundational
      models that are self-supervised and can be adapted with fine-tuning to a wide
      range of natural language tasks, each of which previously would have required
      a separate network model. This is one step closer to the extraordinary versatility
      of human language. GPT-3 and, more recently, LaMDA, both of them LLMs, can carry
      on dialogs with humans on many topics after minimal priming with a few examples.
      However, there has been a wide range of reactions and debate on whether these
      LLMs understand what they are saying or exhibit signs of intelligence. This
      high variance is exhibited in three interviews with LLMs reaching wildly different
      conclusions. A new possibility was uncovered that could explain this divergence.
      What appears to be intelligence in LLMs may in fact be a mirror that reflects
      the intelligence of the interviewer, a remarkable twist that could be considered
      a reverse Turing test. If so, then by studying interviews, we may be learning
      more about the intelligence and beliefs of the interviewer than the intelligence
      of the LLMs. As LLMs become more capable, they may transform the way we interact
      with machines and how they interact with each other. Increasingly, LLMs are
      being coupled with sensorimotor devices. LLMs can talk the talk, but can they
      walk the walk? A road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined
      with seven major improvements inspired by brain systems and how LLMs could in
      turn be used to uncover new insights into brain function.", "venue": "Neural

      a property of biological systems, and in animals (including humans), behavioral
      variability is characterized by certain features, such as the range of variability
      and the shape of its distribution. Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated
      whether and how variability features contribute to the ascription of humanness
      to robots in a human-robot interaction setting. Here, we tested whether two
      aspects of behavioral variability, namely, the standard deviation and the shape
      of distribution of reaction times, affect the ascription of humanness to robots
      during a joint action scenario. We designed an interactive task in which pairs
      of participants performed a joint Simon task with an iCub robot placed by their
      side. Either iCub could perform the task in a preprogrammed manner, or its button
      presses could be teleoperated by the other member of the pair, seated in the
      other room. Under the preprogrammed condition, the iCub pressed buttons with
      reaction times falling within the range of human variability. However, the distribution
      of the reaction times did not resemble a human-like shape. Participants were
      sensitive to humanness, because they correctly detected the human agent above
      chance level. When the iCub was controlled by the computer program, it passed
      our variation of a nonverbal Turing test. Together, our results suggest that
      hints of humanness, such as the range of behavioral variability, might be used
      by observers to ascribe humanness to a humanoid robot.", "venue": "Sci. Robotics",

      "abstract": "Chirality in biomolecules is ubiquitous in our world, but oral
      nanomedicines constructed from chiral peptides are extremely rare, principally
      because of the immature nanofabrication and inadequate bioavailability of chiral
      nanostructures. Methods: To realize the oral administration of chiral peptides
      and break through their forbidden zone in intracellular space, a chiral-peptide
      supramolecular (DPAICP) camouflaging with the membrane from milk-derived extracellular
      vesicles (ME) was developed herein through an aqueous-based growth method of
      chiral peptide Au(I) infinite covalent polymer (DPAICP) involving in organothiol
      D-peptides and Au3+, and a feasible camouflage technology using ME. Results:
      DPAICP@ME possessed favorable pharmaceutical properties to remain stable during
      the gastrointestinal absorption and blood circulation, and showed the satisfactory
      tumor accumulation through oral medication. Expectedly, oral DPAICP@ME played
      its predetermined role in vivo to restore p53 signaling pathway for cancer therapy
      in B16F10 homograft malignant melanoma model, LLC Lewis orthotopic transplantation
      model of lung cancer and patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mice model
      of colon cancer. Moreover, oral DPAICP@ME augmented the action of immunotherapy
      by Anti-PD1 through the further T-cell activation. Conclusion: The de novo design
      of the bionic chiral-peptide supramolecule provides a practicable strategy for
      the construction of biomimetic chiral peptide-derived nanostructures that can
      be taken orally, and likely boosts chiral nanomedicine discovery efforts for
      a wider range of diseases including cancer.", "venue": "Theranostics", "year":

      "Diffusion-driven instabilities with pattern formation may occur in a network
      of identical, regularly-spaced, and resistively-coupled cells if and only if
      the uncoupled cell is poised on a locally-active and stable operating point
      in the Edge of Chaos domain. This manuscript presents the simplest ever-reported
      two-cell neural network, combining together only 7 two-terminal components,
      namely 2 batteries, 3 resistors, and 2 volatile NbOx memristive threshold switches
      from NaMLab, and subject to diffusion-driven instabilities with the concurrent
      emergence of Turing patterns. Very remarkably, this is the first time an homogeneous
      cellular medium, with no other dynamic element than 2 locally-active memristors,
      hence the attribute all-memristor coined to address it in this paper, is found
      to support complex phenomena. The destabilization of the homogeneous solution
      occurs in this second-order two-cell array if and only if the uncoupled cell
      circuit parameters are chosen from the Edge of Chaos domain. A deep circuit-
      and system-theoretic investigation, including linearization analysis and phase
      portrait investigation, provides a comprehensive picture for the local and global
      dynamics of the bio-inspired network, revealing how a theory-assisted approach
      may guide circuit design with inherently non-linear memristive devices.", "venue":

      Neural Text Generation", "abstract": "Recent progress in generative language
      models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts. While
      there are many legitimate applications of such models, there is also a rising
      need to distinguish machine-generated texts from human-written ones (e.g., fake
      news detection). However, to our best knowledge, there is currently no benchmark
      environment with datasets and tasks to systematically study the so-called\"Turing
      Test\"problem for neural text generation methods. In this work, we present the
      TuringBench benchmark environment, which is comprised of (1) a dataset with
      200K human- or machine-generated samples across 20 labels {Human, GPT-1, GPT-2_small,
      GPT-2_medium, GPT-2_large, GPT-2_xl, GPT-2_PyTorch, GPT-3, GROVER_base, GROVER_large,
      GROVER_mega, CTRL, XLM, XLNET_base, XLNET_large, FAIR_wmt19, FAIR_wmt20, TRANSFORMER_XL,
      PPLM_distil, PPLM_gpt2}, (2) two benchmark tasks -- i.e., Turing Test (TT) and
      Authorship Attribution (AA), and (3) a website with leaderboards. Our preliminary
      experimental results using TuringBench show that FAIR_wmt20 and GPT-3 are the
      current winners, among all language models tested, in generating the most human-like
      indistinguishable texts with the lowest F1 score by five state-of-the-art TT
      detection models. The TuringBench is available at: https://turingbench.ist.psu.edu/",

      study neural net architectures is to analyze the functions they can approximate.
      However, constructions from approximation theory may be unrealistic and therefore
      less meaningful. For example, a common unrealistic trick is to encode target
      function values using infinite precision. To address these issues, this work
      proposes a formal definition of statistically meaningful (SM) approximation
      which requires the approximating network to exhibit good statistical learnability.
      We study SM approximation for two function classes: boolean circuits and Turing
      machines. We show that overparameterized feedforward neural nets can SM approximate
      boolean circuits with sample complexity depending only polynomially on the circuit
      size, not the size of the network. In addition, we show that transformers can
      SM approximate Turing machines with computation time bounded by $T$ with sample
      complexity polynomial in the alphabet size, state space size, and $\\log (T)$.
      We also introduce new tools for analyzing generalization which provide much
      tighter sample complexities than the typical VC-dimension or norm-based bounds,
      which may be of independent interest.", "venue": "Neural Information Processing

      A Bayesian Game\u2010Theoretic Approach with Turing Test", "abstract": "Interacting
      with surrounding road users is a key feature of autonomous vehicles and is critical
      for their intelligence testing. Existing interaction modalities in autonomous
      vehicle simulation and testing are not sufficiently smart, and they barely reflect
      human\u2010like behaviors in real\u2010world driving scenarios. Therefore, a
      novel hierarchical game\u2010theoretical framework is presented to represent
      naturalistic multimodal interactions among road users during simulation and
      testing, which is subsequently validated by the Turing test. Given that human
      drivers have no access to the complete information of the surrounding road users,
      the Bayesian game theory is used to model the decision\u2010making process.
      Next, a probing behavior is generated by the proposed game\u2010theoretic model,
      and is further applied to control the vehicle via the Markov chain. The proposed
      method is tested through a series of experiments and compared with existing
      approaches. In addition, Turing tests are conducted to quantify the human\u2010likeness
      of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed Bayesian
      game\u2010theoretic framework can effectively generate representative scenes
      of human\u2010like decision\u2010making during autonomous vehicle interactions,
      demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. An interactive preprint version

      "Proof systems allow one party to prove to another party that a certain statement
      is true. Most existing practical proof systems require that the statement will
      be represented in terms of polynomial equations over a finite field. This makes
      the process of representing a statement that one wishes to prove or verify rather
      complicated, as this process requires a new set of equations for each statement.
      Various approaches to deal with this problem have been proposed, see for example
      [1]. We present Cairo, a practically-efficient Turing-complete STARK-friendly
      CPU architecture. We describe a single set of polynomial equations for the statement
      that the execution of a program on this architecture is valid. Given a statement
      one wishes to prove, Cairo allows writing a program that describes that statement,
      instead of writing a set of polynomial equations.", "venue": "IACR Cryptology

      Region-Induced Deposition Effect of Turing Membrane.", "abstract": "Zinc-based
      batteries are promising for use as energy storage devices owing to their low
      cost and high energy density. However, zinc chemistry commonly encounters serious
      dendrite issues, especially at high areal capacities and current densities,
      limiting their application. Herein, we propose a novel membrane featuring ordered
      undulating stripes called \"Turing patterns\", which can effectively suppress
      zinc dendrites and improve ion conductivity. The crests and troughs in the Turing
      membrane can effectively adjust the Zn(OH)42- distribution and provide more
      zinc deposition space. The coordinated Cu ions during membrane formation can
      interact with Zn(OH)42-, further smoothing zinc deposition. Even at a high current
      density of 80 mA\u00b7cm-2, the Turing membrane enables an alkaline zinc-iron
      flow battery (AZIFB) to work stably with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 160
      mA\u00b7h\u00b7cm-2 for approximately 110 cycles, showing an energy efficiency
      of 90.10%, which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc-based
      batteries with such a high current density. This paper provides valid access

      "title": "Modern perspectives on near-equilibrium analysis of Turing systems",
      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      Using Generative Adversarial Network: Visual Turing Test", "abstract": "(1)
      Introduction: Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      play an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of spinal diseases, especially
      degenerative spinal diseases. MRI is mainly used to diagnose most spinal diseases
      because it shows a higher resolution than CT to distinguish lesions of the spinal
      canals and intervertebral discs. When it is inevitable for CT to be selected
      instead of MR in evaluating spinal disease, evaluation of spinal disease may
      be limited. In these cases, it is very helpful to diagnose spinal disease with
      MR images synthesized with CT images. (2) Objective: To create synthetic lumbar
      magnetic resonance (MR) images from computed tomography (CT) scans using generative
      adversarial network (GAN) models and assess how closely the synthetic images
      resembled the true images using visual Turing tests (VTTs). (3) Material and
      Methods: Overall, 285 patients aged \u2265 40 years who underwent lumbar CT
      and MRI were enrolled. Based on axial CT and T2-weighted axial MR images from
      285 patients, an image synthesis model using a GAN was trained using three algorithms
      (unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised methods). Furthermore, VTT to
      determine how similar the synthetic lumbar MR images generated from lumbar CT
      axial images were to the true lumbar MR axial images were conducted with 59
      patients who were not included in the model training. For the VTT, we designed
      an evaluation form comprising 600 randomly distributed axial images (150 true
      and 450 synthetic images from unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised
      methods). Four readers judged the authenticity of each image and chose their
      first- and second-choice candidates for the true image. In addition, for the
      three models, structural similarities (SSIM) were evaluated and the peak signal
      to noise ratio (PSNR) was compared among the three methods. (4) Results: The
      mean accuracy for the selection of true images for all four readers for their
      first choice was 52.0% (312/600). The accuracies of determining the true image
      for each reader\u2019s first and first + second choices, respectively, were
      as follows: reader 1, 51.3% and 78.0%; reader 2, 38.7% and 62.0%, reader 3,
      69.3% and 84.0%, and reader 4, 48.7% and 70.7%. In the case of synthetic images
      chosen as first and second choices, supervised algorithm-derived images were
      the most often selected (supervised, 118/600 first and 164/600 second; semi-supervised,
      90/600 and 144/600; and unsupervised, 80/600 and 114/600). For image quality,
      the supervised algorithm received the best score (PSNR: 15.987 \u00b1 1.039,
      SSIM: 0.518 \u00b1 0.042). (5) Conclusion: This was the pilot study to apply
      GAN to synthesize lumbar spine MR images from CT images and compare training
      algorithms of the GAN. Based on VTT, the axial MR images synthesized from lumbar
      CT using GAN were fairly realistic and the supervised training algorithm was
      found to provide the closest image to true images.", "venue": "Diagnostics",

      discussed the concept of using a form of Turing\u2010like test for model evaluation,
      together with eight principles for implementing such an approach. In this part,
      the framing of fitness\u2010for\u2010purpose as a Turing\u2010like test is discussed,
      together with an example application of trying to assess whether a rainfall\u2010runoff
      model might be an adequate representation of the discharge response in a catchment
      for predicting future natural flood management scenarios. It is shown that the
      variation between event runoff coefficients in the record can be used to create
      some limits of acceptability that implicitly take some account of the epistemic
      uncertainties arising from lack of knowledge about errors in rainfall and discharge
      observations. In the case study it is demonstrated that the model used cannot
      be validated in this way across all the range of observed discharges, but that
      behavioural models can be found for the peak flows that are the subject of interest
      in the application. Thinking in terms of the Turing\u2010like test focusses
      attention on the critical observations needed to test whether streamflow is
      being produced in the right way so that a model is considered as fit\u2010for\u2010purpose
      in predicting the impacts of future change scenarios. As is the case for uncertainty
      estimation in general, it is argued that the assumptions made in setting behavioural
      limits of acceptability should be stated explicitly to leave an audit trail
      in any application that can be reviewed by users of the model outputs.", "venue":

      Turing test has been used to investigate whether machines have intelligence
      similar to humans. Our study aimed to assess the ability of an artificial intelligence
      (AI) system for spine tumor detection using the Turing test. Methods Our retrospective
      study data included 12179 images from 321 patients for developing AI detection
      systems and 6635 images from 187 patients for the Turing test. We utilized a
      deep learning-based tumor detection system with Faster R-CNN architecture, which
      generates region proposals by Region Proposal Network in the first stage and
      corrects the position and the size of the bounding box of the lesion area in
      the second stage. Each choice question featured four bounding boxes enclosing
      an identical tumor. Three were detected by the proposed deep learning model,
      whereas the other was annotated by a doctor; the results were shown to six doctors
      as respondents. If the respondent did not correctly identify the image annotated
      by a human, his answer was considered a misclassification. If all misclassification
      rates were >30%, the respondents were considered unable to distinguish the AI-detected
      tumor from the human-annotated one, which indicated that the AI system passed
      the Turing test. Results The average misclassification rates in the Turing test
      were 51.2% (95% CI: 45.7%\u201357.5%) in the axial view (maximum of 62%, minimum
      of 44%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 38.2%\u201351.8%) in the sagittal view (maximum of
      59%, minimum of 36%). The misclassification rates of all six respondents were
      >30%; therefore, our AI system passed the Turing test. Conclusion Our proposed

      "title": "One-Tape Turing Machine and Branching Program Lower Bounds for MCSP",
      "abstract": "For a size parameter s : N \u2192 N, the Minimum Circuit Size Problem
      (denoted by MCSP[s(n)]) is the problem of deciding whether the minimum circuit
      size of a given function f : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1} (represented by a string of
      length N := 2) is at most a threshold s(n). A recent line of work exhibited
      \u201chardness magnification\u201d phenomena for MCSP: A very weak lower bound
      for MCSP implies a breakthrough result in complexity theory. For example, McKay,
      Murray, and Williams (STOC 2019) implicitly showed that, for some constant \u03bc1
      > 0, if MCSP[2\u03bc1\u00b7n] cannot be computed by a one-tape Turing machine
      (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) running in time N1.01, then
      P 6= NP. In this paper, we present the following new lower bounds against one-tape
      Turing machines and branching programs: 1. A randomized two-sided error one-tape
      Turing machine (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) cannot compute
      MCSP[2\u03bc2\u00b7n] in time N1.99, for some constant \u03bc2 > \u03bc1. 2.
      A non-deterministic (or parity) branching program of size o(N1.5/ logN) cannot
      compute MKTP, which is a time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity analogue of MCSP.
      This is shown by directly applying the Nechiporuk method to MKTP, which previously
      appeared to be difficult. These results are the first non-trivial lower bounds
      for MCSP and MKTP against one-tape Turing machines and non-deterministic branching
      programs, and essentially match the best-known lower bounds for any explicit
      functions against these computational models. The first result is based on recent
      constructions of pseudorandom generators for read-once oblivious branching programs
      (ROBPs) and combinatorial rectangles (Forbes and Kelley, FOCS 2018; Viola 2019).
      En route, we obtain several related results: 1. There exists a (local) hitting
      set generator with seed length \u00d5( \u221a N) secure against read-once polynomial-size
      non-deterministic branching programs on N -bit inputs. 2. Any read-once co-non-deterministic
      branching program computing MCSP must have size at least 2\u03a9\u0303(N). 2012

      (TTM), a sequential, autoregressive Transformer model with memory for real-world
      sequential visual understanding. Our model is inspired by the seminal Neural
      Turing Machine, and has an external memory consisting of a set of tokens which
      summarise the previous history (i.e., frames). This memory is efficiently addressed,
      read and written using a Transformer as the processing unit/controller at each
      step. The model''s memory module ensures that a new observation will only be
      processed with the contents of the memory (and not the entire history), meaning
      that it can efficiently process long sequences with a bounded computational
      cost at each step. We show that TTM outperforms other alternatives, such as
      other Transformer models designed for long sequences and recurrent neural networks,

      that a seemingly minor change, the removal or rewiring of a single link, can
      prompt dramatic changes in pattern diversity. The determinants of such critical
      occurrences are explored through an extensive and systematic set of numerical
      experiments. We identify situations where the topological sensitivity of the
      attractor landscape can be predicted without a full simulation of the dynamical
      equations, from the spectrum of the graph Laplacian and the linearized dynamics.
      Unexpectedly, the main determinant appears to be the degeneracy of the eigenvalues
      or the growth rate and not the number of unstable modes.", "venue": "Physical

      "Theory of choreographic languages typically includes a number of complex results
      that are proved by structural induction. The high number of cases and the subtle
      details in some of them lead to long reviewing processes, and occasionally to
      errors being found in published proofs. In this work, we take a published proof
      of Turing completeness of a choreographic language and formalise it in Coq.
      Our development includes formalising the choreographic language and its basic
      properties, Kleene''s theory of partial recursive functions, the encoding of
      these functions as choreographies, and proving this encoding correct. \nWith
      this effort, we show that theorem proving can be a very useful tool in the field
      of choreographic languages: besides the added degree of confidence that we get
      from a mechanised proof, the formalisation process led us to a significant simplification
      of the underlying theory. Our results offer a foundation for the future formal
      development of choreographic languages.", "venue": "International Conference

      "Turing patterns have morphed from mathematical curiosities into highly desirable
      targets for synthetic biology. For a long time, their biological significance
      was sometimes disputed but there is now ample evidence for their involvement
      in processes ranging from skin pigmentation to digit and limb formation. While
      their role in developmental biology is now firmly established, their synthetic
      design has so far proved challenging. Here, we review recent large-scale mathematical
      analyses that have attempted to narrow down potential design principles. We
      consider different aspects of robustness of these models and outline why this
      perspective will be helpful in the search for synthetic Turing-patterning systems.
      We conclude by considering robustness in the context of developmental modelling

      "title": "Can machines think? The controversy that led to the Turing test",
      "abstract": "Turing\u2019s much debated test has turned 70 and is still fairly
      controversial. His 1950 paper is seen as a complex and multilayered text, and
      key questions about it remain largely unanswered. Why did Turing select learning
      from experience as the best approach to achieve machine intelligence? Why did
      he spend several years working with chess-playing as a task to illustrate and
      test for machine intelligence only to trade it out for conversational question-answering
      in 1950? Why did Turing refer to gender imitation in a test for machine intelligence?
      In this article, I shall address these questions by unveiling social, historical
      and epistemological roots of the so-called Turing test. I will draw attention
      to a historical fact that has been only scarcely observed in the secondary literature
      thus far, namely, that Turing''s 1950 test emerged out of a controversy over
      the cognitive capabilities of digital computers, most notably out of debates
      with physicist and computer pioneer Douglas Hartree, chemist and philosopher
      Michael Polanyi, and neurosurgeon Geoffrey Jefferson. Seen in its historical
      context, Turing\u2019s 1950 paper can be understood as essentially a reply to
      a series of challenges posed to him by these thinkers arguing against his view
      that machines can think. Turing did propose gender learning and imitation as
      one of his various imitation tests for machine intelligence, and I argue here
      that this was done in response to Jefferson''s suggestion that gendered behavior
      is causally related to the physiology of sex hormones.", "venue": "", "year":

      "title": "Approximate localised dihedral patterns near a turing instability",
      "abstract": "Fully localised patterns involving cellular hexagons or squares
      have been found experimentally and numerically in various continuum models.
      However, there is currently no mathematical theory for the emergence of these
      localised cellular patterns from a quiescent state. A key issue is that standard
      techniques for one-dimensional patterns have proven insufficient for understanding
      localisation in higher dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive
      approach to this problem by using techniques developed in the study of radially-symmetric
      patterns. Our analysis covers localised planar patterns equipped with a wide
      range of dihedral symmetries, thereby avoiding a restriction to solutions on
      a predetermined lattice. The context in this paper is a theory for the emergence
      of such patterns near a Turing instability for a general class of planar reaction-diffusion
      equations. Posing the reaction-diffusion system in polar coordinates, we carry
      out a finite-mode Fourier decomposition in the angular variable to yield a large
      system of coupled radial ordinary differential equations. We then utilise various
      radial spatial dynamics methods, such as invariant manifolds, rescaling charts,
      and normal form analysis, leading to an algebraic matching condition for localised
      patterns to exist in the finite-mode reduction. This algebraic matching condition
      is nontrivial, which we solve via a combination of by-hand calculations and
      Gr\u00f6bner bases from polynomial algebra to reveal the existence of a plethora
      of localised dihedral patterns. These results capture the essence of the emergent
      localised hexagonal patterns witnessed in experiments. Moreover, we combine
      computer-assisted analysis and a Newton\u2013Kantorovich procedure to prove
      the existence of localised patches with 6\u2009m-fold symmetry for arbitrarily
      large Fourier decompositions. This includes the localised hexagon patches that
      have been elusive to analytical treatment.", "venue": "Nonlinearity", "year":

      systems. We show that solutions of surrogate models built by classical Proper
      Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) exhibit an unstable error behaviour over the
      dimension of the reduced space. To overcome this drawback, first of all, we
      propose a POD-DEIM technique with a correction term that includes missing information
      in the reduced models. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose an
      adaptive version of this algorithm in time that accounts for the peculiar dynamics
      of the RD-PDE in presence of Turing instability. We show the effectiveness of
      the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost for a selection
      of RD systems, i.e., FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo, Schnakenberg and the morphochemical
      DIB models, with increasing degree of nonlinearity and more structured patterns.",

      to reconsider either model structures or the available data more closely, that
      is to challenge our fundamental understanding of the problem at hand. It is
      not easy, however, to decide when a model should be invalidated, when we expect
      that the sources of uncertainty in environmental modelling will often be epistemic
      rather than simply aleatory in nature. In particular, epistemic errors in model
      inputs may well exert a very strong control over how accurate we might expect
      model predictions to be when compared against evaluation data that might also
      be subject to epistemic uncertainties. We suggest that both modellers and referees
      should treat model validation as a form of Turing\u2010like Test, whilst being
      more explicit about how the uncertainties in observed data and their impacts
      are assessed. Eight principles in formulating such tests are presented. Being
      explicit about the decisions made in framing an analysis is one important way
      to facilitate communication with users of model outputs, especially when it
      is intended to use a model simulator as a \u2018model of everywhere\u2019 or

      of network structures, and also are the foundations of understanding and controlling
      complex networks. The existing studies (e.g., scale-free model, small-world
      model) are insufficient to uncover the internal mechanisms of the emergence
      and evolution of communities in networks. To overcome the above limitation,
      in consideration of the fact that a network can be regarded as a pattern composed
      of communities, we introduce Turing pattern dynamic as theory support to construct
      the network evolution model. Specifically, we develop a Reaction-Diffusion model
      according to Q-Learning technology (RDQL), in which each node regarded as an
      intelligent agent makes a behavior choice to update its relationships, based
      on the utility and behavioral strategy at every time step. Extensive experiments
      indicate that our model not only reveals how communities form and evolve, but
      also can generate networks with the properties of scale-free, small-world and
      assortativity. The effectiveness of the RDQL model has also been verified by
      its application in real networks. Furthermore, the depth analysis of the RDQL
      model provides a conclusion that the proportion of exploration and exploitation
      behaviors of nodes is the only factor affecting the formation of communities.

      ideas on biological pattern and the events that led to their wider acceptance
      by biologists as a valid way to investigate developmental pattern, and of the
      value of theory more generally in biology. Periodic patterns have played a key
      role in this process, especially 2D arrays of oriented stripes, which proved
      a disappointment in theoretical terms in the case of Drosophila segmentation,
      but a boost to theory as applied to skin patterns in fish and model chemical
      reactions. The concept of \u201corder from fluctuations\u201d is a key component
      of Turing\u2019s theory, wherein pattern arises by selective amplification of
      spatial components concealed in the random disorder of molecular and/or cellular
      processes. For biological examples, a crucial point from an analytical standpoint
      is knowing the nature of the fluctuations, where the amplifier resides, and
      the timescale over which selective amplification occurs. The answer clarifies
      the difference between \u201cinelegant\u201d examples such as Drosophila segmentation,
      which is perhaps better understood as a programmatic assembly process, and \u201celegant\u201d
      ones expressible in equations like Turing\u2019s: that the fluctuations and
      selection process occur predominantly in evolutionary time for the former, but
      in real time for the latter, and likewise for error suppression, which for Drosophila
      is historical, in being lodged firmly in past evolutionary events. The prospects
      for a further extension of Turing\u2019s ideas to the complexities of brain
      development and consciousness is discussed, where a case can be made that it
      could well be in neuroscience that his ideas find their most important application.",

      problem in large alphabet modeling, with a variety of applications in machine

      is perhaps the most popular OP estimation scheme. Classical results show that

      we introduce new exact convergence guarantees for the GT estimator, based on
      worst-case mean squared error analysis. Our scheme improves upon currently known
      results. Further, we introduce a novel simultaneous convergence rate, for any

      a Turing bifurcation in the Swift-Hohenberg equation using a novel approach
      based on geometric blow-up. We show that the formally derived multiple scales
      ansatz which is known from classical modulation theory can be adapted for use
      in the fast-slow setting, by reformulating it as a blow-up transformation. This
      leads to dynamically simpler modulation equations posed in the blown-up space,
      via a formal procedure which directly extends the established approach to the
      time-dependent setting. The modulation equations take the form of non-autonomous
      Ginzburg-Landau equations, which can be analysed within the blow-up. The asymptotics
      of solutions in weighted Sobelev spaces are given in two different cases: (i)
      A symmetric case featuring a delayed loss of stability, and (ii) A second case
      in which the symmetry is broken by a source term. In order to characterise the
      dynamics of the Swift-Hohenberg equation itself we derive rigorous estimates
      on the error of the dynamic modulation approximation. These estimates are obtained
      by bounding weak solutions to an evolution equation for the error which is also

      "title": "Effects of anisotropic diffusion on Turing patterns in heterogeneous
      environment", "abstract": "Diffusion plays a crucial role in the formation and
      evolution of Turing patterns. Generally, the diffusion processes in complex
      systems do not meet the complete random walk theory, which means the diffusion
      is abnormal rather than normal, such as super-diffusion, sub-diffusion and anisotropic
      diffusion. However, most of previous studies are concentrated on the pattern
      formation mechanism under the normal diffusion. In this paper, a two-component
      reaction-diffusion model with anisotropic diffusion was employed to study the
      effect of anisotropic diffusion on Turing patterns in heterogeneous environments.
      Three different types of anisotropic diffusions have been utilized. It is shown
      that the system gives rise to stripe patterns when the degree of anisotropic
      diffusion is high. The direction of stripes is determined by the deviation degree
      of the diffusion coefficient away from the bifurcation point. With a low degree
      of anisotropic diffusion, the pattern type is the same as than in the isotropic
      diffusion. When the diffusion coefficient grows linearly in the space, different
      types of patterns compete with each other and survive in different regions under
      the influence of spatial heterogeneity. When the diffusion coefficient is modulated
      by a one-dimensional periodic function, both type and wavelength of the pattern
      are determined by the modulated wavelength and the intrinsic wavelength. The
      system can exhibit alternating two-scale mixed patterns of different types when
      the modulated wavelength is larger than the intrinsic wavelength. Note that
      the diffusion coefficient of some special anisotropic media is a tensor, which
      can be expressed as a matrix in two-dimensional cases, we also studied the influence
      of off-diagonal diffusion coefficient D on Turing patterns. It is found that
      the Turing pattern induced by off-diagonal diffusion coefficient always selects
      the oblique stripe pattern. The off-diagonal diffusion coefficient D not only
      affects the pattern selection mechanism, but also expands the parameter range
      of Turing space. The critical diffusion coefficient Dc increases linearly with
      the diagonal diffusion coefficient Du. The intrinsic wavelength of the oblique
      stripe pattern decreases as the off-diagonal diffusion coefficient D increases.
      It is interesting to note that the critical wavelength corresponding to the
      critical diffusion coefficient Dc is independent of the diagonal diffusion coefficient
      Du. These results not only provide a new insight into the formation mechanism
      of Turing patterns, but also increase the range and complexity of possible patterns.",

      computation is the formal description of a finite state machine, the Universal
      Turing Machine, based on manipulation of integers and logic symbols. In this
      contribution to the discourse on the computer-brain analogy, we discuss the
      extent to which analog computing, as performed by the mammalian brain, is like
      and unlike the digital computing of Universal Turing Machines. We begin with
      ordinary reality being a permanent dialog between continuous and discontinuous
      worlds. So it is with computing, which can be analog or digital, and is often
      mixed. The theory behind computers is essentially digital, but efficient simulations
      of phenomena can be performed by analog devices; indeed, any physical calculation
      requires implementation in the physical world and is therefore analog to some
      extent, despite being based on abstract logic and arithmetic. The mammalian
      brain, comprised of neuronal networks, functions as an analog device and has
      given rise to artificial neural networks that are implemented as digital algorithms
      but function as analog models would. Analog constructs compute with the implementation
      of a variety of feedback and feedforward loops. In contrast, digital algorithms
      allow the implementation of recursive processes that enable them to generate
      unparalleled emergent properties. We briefly illustrate how the cortical organization
      of neurons can integrate signals and make predictions analogically. While we
      conclude that brains are not digital computers, we speculate on the recent implementation
      of human writing in the brain as a possible digital path that slowly evolves
      the brain into a genuine (slow) Turing machine.", "venue": "Frontiers in Ecology

      "It is becoming increasingly popular for distributed systems to exploit offload
      to reduce load on the CPU. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) offload, in particular,
      has become popular. However, RDMA still requires CPU intervention for complex
      offloads that go beyond simple remote memory access. As such, the offload potential
      is limited and RDMA-based systems usually have to work around such limitations.
      We present RedN, a principled, practical approach to implementing complex RDMA
      offloads, without requiring any hardware modifications. Using self-modifying
      RDMA chains, we lift the existing RDMA verbs interface to a Turing complete
      set of programming abstractions. We explore what is possible in terms of offload
      complexity and performance with a commodity RDMA NIC. We show how to integrate
      these RDMA chains into applications, such as the Memcached key-value store,
      allowing us to offload complex tasks such as key lookups. RedN can reduce the
      latency of key-value get operations by up to 2.6x compared to state-of-the-art
      KV designs that use one-sided RDMA primitives (e.g., FaRM-KV), as well as traditional
      RPC-over-RDMA approaches. Moreover, compared to these baselines, RedN provides
      performance isolation and, in the presence of contention, can reduce latency
      by up to 35x while providing applications with failure resiliency to OS and

      "title": "Studies of Turing pattern formation in zebrafish skin", "abstract":
      "Skin patterns are the first example of the existence of Turing patterns in
      living organisms. Extensive research on zebrafish, a model organism with stripes
      on its skin, has revealed the principles of pattern formation at the molecular
      and cellular levels. Surprisingly, although the networks of cell\u2013cell interactions
      have been observed to satisfy the \u2018short-range activation and long-range
      inhibition\u2019 prerequisites for Turing pattern formation, numerous individual
      reactions were not envisioned based on the classical reaction\u2013diffusion
      model. For example, in real skin, it is not an alteration in concentrations
      of chemicals, but autonomous migration and proliferation of pigment cells that
      establish patterns, and cell\u2013cell interactions are mediated via direct
      contact through cell protrusions. Therefore, the classical reaction\u2013diffusion
      mechanism cannot be used as it is for modelling skin pattern formation. Various
      studies are underway to adapt mathematical models to the experimental findings
      on research into skin patterns, and the purpose of this review is to organize

      Turing\u2019s 1950 \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d and the
      current considerable public exposure to the term \u201cartificial intelligence
      (AI)\u201d, Turing\u2019s question \u201cCan a machine think?\u201d has become
      a topic of daily debate in the media, the home, and, indeed, the pub. However,
      \u201cCan a machine think?\u201d is sliding towards a more controversial issue:
      \u201cCan a machine be conscious?\u201d Of course, the two issues are linked.
      It is held here that consciousness is a pre-requisite to thought. In Turing\u2019s
      imitation game, a conscious human player is replaced by a machine, which, in
      the first place, is assumed not to be conscious, and which may fool an interlocutor,
      as consciousness cannot be perceived from an individual\u2019s speech or action.
      Here, the developing paradigm of machine consciousness is examined and combined
      with an extant analysis of living consciousness to argue that a conscious machine
      is feasible, and capable of thinking. The route to this utilizes learning in
      a \u201cneural state machine\u201d, which brings into play Turing\u2019s view
      of neural \u201cunorganized\u201d machines. The conclusion is that a machine
      of the \u201cunorganized\u201d kind could have an artificial form of consciousness
      that resembles the natural form and that throws some light on its nature.",

      systems", "abstract": "Motivated by bacterial chemotaxis and multi-species ecological
      interactions in heterogeneous environments, we study a general one-dimensional
      reaction-cross-diffusion system in the presence of spatial heterogeneity in
      both transport and reaction terms. Under a suitable asymptotic assumption that
      the transport is slow over the domain, while gradients in the reaction heterogeneity
      are not too sharp, we study the stability of a heterogeneous steady state approximated
      by the system in the absence of transport. Using a WKB ansatz, we find that
      this steady state can undergo a Turing-type instability in subsets of the domain,
      leading to the formation of localized patterns. The boundaries of the pattern-forming
      regions are given asymptotically by `local'' Turing conditions corresponding
      to a spatially homogeneous analysis parameterized by the spatial variable. We
      developed a general open-source code which is freely available, and show numerical
      examples of this localized pattern formation in a Schnakenberg cross-diffusion
      system, a Keller-Segel chemotaxis model, and the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto
      model with heterogeneous parameters. We numerically show that the patterns may
      undergo secondary instabilities leading to spatiotemporal movement of spikes,
      though these remain approximately within the asymptotically predicted localized
      regions. This theory can elegantly differentiate between spatial structure due
      to background heterogeneity, from spatial patterns emergent from Turing-type
      instabilities.", "venue": "Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems - B", "year":

      "title": "Emergence of Geometric Turing Patterns in Complex Networks", "abstract":
      "Turing patterns, arising from the interplay between competing species of diffusive
      particles, has long been an important concept for describing non-equilibrium
      self-organization in nature, and has been extensively investigated in many chemical
      and biological systems. Historically, these patterns have been studied in extended
      systems and lattices. Recently, the Turing instability was found to produce
      topological patterns in networks with scale-free degree distributions and the
      small world property, although with an apparent absence of geometric organization.
      While hints of explicitly geometric patterns in simple network models (e.g Watts-Strogatz)
      have been found, the question of the exact nature and morphology of geometric
      Turing patterns in heterogeneous complex networks remains unresolved. In this
      work, we study the Turing instability in the framework of geometric random graph
      models, where the network topology is explained by an underlying geometric space.
      We demonstrate that not only can geometric patterns be observed, their wavelength
      can also be estimated by studying the eigenvectors of the annealed graph Laplacian.
      Finally, we show that Turing patterns can be found in geometric embeddings of
      real networks. These results indicate that there is a profound connection between
      the function of a network and its hidden geometry, even when the associated
      dynamical processes are exclusively determined by the network topology.", "venue":

      to control computational uncertainty and thus decide the outcome of the computation.

      analysis for being a \u201cprecise and unquestionably adequate definition\u201d
      of formal system or mechanical computability, G\u00f6del nevertheless published
      a short note in 1972 claiming to have found a \u201cphilosophical error\u201d
      in Turing\u2019s argument with regard to the finite nature of mental states
      and memory. A natural question arises: how could G\u00f6del enjoy the generality
      conferred on his results by Turing\u2019s work, despite the error of its ways?
      Previous interpretative strategies by Feferman, Shagrir and others have mainly
      tried to resolve the disparity by distinguishing different types of arguments
      in Turing and taking G\u00f6del to approve only some of them. By a more integral
      examination of their ideas, especially Turing\u2019s response to the \u201cmathematical
      objection\u201d based on G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem and G\u00f6del\u2019s
      own conception of finite yet non-mechanical procedures, and taking some of the
      main ideas of current developments in machine learning into consideration, I
      will try to present a new explanation for the apparent disparity, arguing that
      there is no \u201cerror\u201d on Turing\u2019s side and the seemingly conflicting
      views held by Turing and G\u00f6del should best be seen as complementary, keeping

      a Turing-complete paradigm for neural computation based on synfire rings. More
      specifically, we provide an algorithmic procedure which, for any fixed-space
      Turing machine, builds a corresponding Boolean neural network composed of synfire
      rings capable of simulating it. As a consequence, any fixed-space Turing machine
      with tapes of length $N$ can be simulated in linear time by some Boolean neural
      network composed of O(N) rings and cells. The construction can naturally be
      extended to general Turing machines. Therefore, any Turing machine can be simulated
      in linear time by some Boolean neural network composed of infinitely many synfire
      rings. The linear time simulation relies on the possibility to mimic the behavior
      of the machines. In the long term, these results might contribute to the realization

      "abstract": "A key challenge on the path to developing agents that learn complex
      human-like behavior is the need to quickly and accurately quantify human-likeness.
      While human assessments of such behavior can be highly accurate, speed and scalability
      are limited. We address these limitations through a novel automated Navigation
      Turing Test (ANTT) that learns to predict human judgments of human-likeness.
      We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated NTT on a navigation task in
      a complex 3D environment. We investigate six classification models to shed light
      on the types of architectures best suited to this task, and validate them against
      data collected through a human NTT. Our best models achieve high accuracy when
      distinguishing true human and agent behavior. At the same time, we show that
      predicting finer-grained human assessment of agents'' progress towards human-like
      behavior remains unsolved. Our work takes an important step towards agents that
      more effectively learn complex human-like behavior.", "venue": "International

      by interfacial polymerization is of great importance in dictating the separation
      performance. Herein, polyamide membranes with a specific nanoscale striped Turing
      structure are generated through facile addition of Zr-based metal-organic framework
      UiO-66-NH2 in the aqueous triethylenetetramine phase. Interestingly, accompanied
      by the degradation of UiO-66-NH2 in aqueous solution, an intermediate complex
      is in situ formed through the strong interaction between the Zr metal center
      and the amine group from triethylenetetramine, which can lower amine diffusion
      and induce a local interfacial reaction, contributing to the generation of a
      homogeneous nanoscale striped Turing structure. The resulting membranes are
      used for CO2/CH4 gas separation. Compared with the parent polyamide membrane
      displaying a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 43.1 and a CO2 permeance of 31.5 GPU, the
      membrane with 0.02 wt % of UiO-66-NH2 introduced into the aqueous phase shows
      a higher CO2/CH4 selectivity of 58.3, along with a CO2 permeance of 27.1 GPU.
      Additionally, when 0.1 wt % of UiO-66-NH2 is incorporated into the aqueous phase,

      "title": "Dynamic transitions and Turing patterns of the Brusselator model",
      "abstract": "The dynamic transitions of the Brusselator model has been recently
      analyzed in Choi et al. (2021) and Ma and Wang (2011). Our aim in this paper
      is to address the relation between the pattern formation and dynamic transition
      results left open in those papers. We consider the problem in the setting of
      a 2D rectangular box where an instability of the homogeneous steady state occurs
      due to the perturbations in the direction of several modes becoming critical
      simultaneously. Our main results are twofold: (1) a rigorous characterization
      of the types and structure of the dynamic transitions of the model from basic
      homogeneous states and (2) the relation between the dynamic transitions and

      made intriguing statements about the future of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI)
      in society. He predicted that machines would eventually \u2018compete with men
      in all purely intellectual \ufb01elds,\u2019 and added that at some stage they
      could be expected \u2018to take control.\u2019 Turing has been associated by
      his biographer, Andrew Hodges, with Dr. Frankenstein from Mary Shelley\u2019s
      dystopian novel. However, he has also been described by his contemporary Geoffrey
      Jefferson as a \u2018scienti\ufb01c\u2019 Percy B. Shelley, the English Romantic
      poet who was posthumously championed as a utopian and radical thinker. This
      article then asks: in what way did Turing envision a society permeated with
      intelligent machines? Did he see it as a utopia or a dystopia? These questions
      are thoroughly examined using Turing\u2019s own texts and related sources. This
      study reconstructs Turing\u2019s historical context in postwar England and analyzes
      his irony and sense of humor, as well as the in\ufb02uence of Samuel Butler
      on his vision. Contrary to recent views in AI science and \ufb01ction, on the
      one hand, a mismatch is shown between Turing and the incautious Frankenstein;
      on the other hand, Turing\u2019s radical Shelley-like qualities are substantiated.
      The article shows that Turing\u2019s utopianism entrusted intelligent machines
      with the task of teaching lessons of rationality and intellectual integrity
      over our place in nature and prejudices. Further, Turing\u2019s irony is shown
      to have targeted intellectuals who sacri\ufb01ce independent thinking to retain
      their power. These, he hoped, would be eventually rivaled and surpassed by intelligent
      machines.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount":

      hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is
      presented explicitly as a physical principle: \u2018every finitely realizible
      physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine
      operating by finite means\u2019. Classical physics and the universal Turing
      machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey
      the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing
      machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines
      is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ''universal quantum
      computer\u2019 are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling
      the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have
      many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do
      not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include
      \u2018quantum parallelism\u2019, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks
      can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
      restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable
      strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett\u2019s. Some
      of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the
      rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically
      more reasonable definition of the \u2018complexity\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019

      "title": "Polyamide membranes with nanoscale Turing structures for water purification",
      "abstract": "Turing structures at the nanoscale Turing structures arise when
      imbalances in diffusion rates make a stable steady-state system sensitive to
      small heterogeneous perturbations. For example, Turing patterns occur in chemical
      reactions when a fast-moving inhibitor controls the motion of a slower-moving
      activator. Tan et al. grew polyamide membranes by using interfacial polymerization,
      where the reactions occur at the interface between oil and water layers. The
      addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the aqueous phase reduced the diffusion of
      the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands,
      which prove to be better for water desalination. Science, this issue p. 518
      Turing structures generated via diffusion-driven instabilities make polyamide
      membranes for water desalination. The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental
      importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications
      have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based
      on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for
      water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions
      enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes
      exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound
      line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence
      of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport
      through the membranes is enhanced.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to
      this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem.We
      present an evaluation model (ADEM)that learns to predict human-like scores to
      input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that
      the ADEM model\u2019s predictions correlate significantly, and at a level much
      higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both
      the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize to evaluating

      "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs, coupled
      with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a hurdle
      for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
      Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
      using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s
      latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine
      Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations.
      Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications.
      We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the
      P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
      higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study
      the performance of the T4''s TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on
      low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces
      new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s
      instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions.
      We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as
      the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large
      as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4
      memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over
      its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
      workloads that hit power or thermal limits. \nMany of our findings are novel,
      published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software
      developers get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "Stochastic Turing patterns in a synthetic bacterial population", "abstract":
      "Significance In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could
      arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing
      inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing\u2019s conditions are disappointingly
      hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts
      pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered
      bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor
      system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered
      patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively
      with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms,
      driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much
      broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin of biological
      morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our
      understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952,
      Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability
      of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion
      systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing
      activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and
      the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called
      into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator\u2013inhibitor
      birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts
      the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with
      no severe requirement on the ratio of activator\u2013inhibitor diffusion coefficients.
      To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically
      engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules
      form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming
      gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered
      bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale
      much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental
      patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These
      results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity,
      can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings
      provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising
      from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.",

      as malignant or benign is still an underlying challenge. To address this challenge,
      radiologists need computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can assist in
      learning discriminative imaging features corresponding to malignant and benign
      nodules. However, learning highly discriminative imaging features is an open
      problem. In this paper, our aim is to learn the most discriminative features
      pertaining to lung nodules by using an adversarial learning methodology. Specifically,
      we propose to use un-supervised learning with Deep Convolutional-Generative
      Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) to generate lung nodule samples realistically.
      We hypothesize that imaging features of lung nodules will be discriminative
      if it is hard to differentiate them (fake) from real (true) nodules. To test
      this hypothesis, we present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order
      to evaluate the quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons
      are performed in discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules.
      This experimental set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated
      nodules, which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining
      highly discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational

      but less is known concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous
      media. It is non-trivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent

      We employ WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
      which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions. We find that the
      structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical trigonometric
      functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of different growth
      rates are localized to different spatial regions. This localization helps explain
      common amplitude modulations observed in simulations of Turing systems in heterogeneous
      settings. We numerically demonstrate this theory, giving an illustrative example
      of the emergent instabilities and the striking complexity arising from spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion systems. Our results give insight both
      into systems driven by exogenous heterogeneity, as well as successive pattern
      forming processes, noting that most scenarios in biology do not involve symmetry
      breaking from homogeneity, but instead consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous

      researchers today believe that each finger forms because of its unique position
      within the early limb bud. However, 30 years ago, developmental biologists proposed
      that the arrangement of fingers followed the Turing pattern, a self-organizing
      process during early embryo development. Raspopovic et al. provide evidence
      to support a Turing mechanism (see the Perspective by Zuniga and Zeller). They
      reveal that Bmp and Wnt signaling pathways, together with the gene Sox9, form
      a Turing network. The authors used this network to generate a computer model
      capable of accurately reproducing the patterns that cells follow as the embryo
      grows fingers. Science, this issue p. 566; see also p. 516 Modeling and experiments
      reveal how limb digits are patterned by three components. [Also see Perspective
      by Zuniga and Zeller] During limb development, digits emerge from the undifferentiated
      mesenchymal tissue that constitutes the limb bud. It has been proposed that
      this process is controlled by a self-organizing Turing mechanism, whereby diffusible
      molecules interact to produce a periodic pattern of digital and interdigital
      fates. However, the identities of the molecules remain unknown. By combining
      experiments and modeling, we reveal evidence that a Turing network implemented
      by Bmp, Sox9, and Wnt drives digit specification. We develop a realistic two-dimensional
      simulation of digit patterning and show that this network, when modulated by
      morphogen gradients, recapitulates the expression patterns of Sox9 in the wild
      type and in perturbation experiments. Our systems biology approach reveals how
      a combination of growth, morphogen gradients, and a self-organizing Turing network

      "title": "Visual Turing test for computer vision systems", "abstract": "Significance
      In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods
      of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations
      measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according
      to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding.
      We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares
      a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to
      probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition
      to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy
      in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated
      by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a
      story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted
      device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given
      test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides
      the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes
      the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered
      to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s
      answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question.
      Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural
      language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned
      from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the
      answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,
      is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test
      is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions
      that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object,

      Vertebrates have a vast array of epithelial appendages, including scales, feathers,
      and hair. The developmental patterning of these diverse structures can be theoretically
      explained by Alan Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion system. However, the role
      of this system in epithelial appendage patterning of early diverging lineages
      (compared to tetrapods), such as the cartilaginous fishes, is poorly understood.
      We investigate patterning of the unique tooth-like skin denticles of sharks,
      which closely relates to their hydrodynamic and protective functions. We demonstrate
      through simulation models that a Turing-like mechanism can explain shark denticle
      patterning and verify this system using gene expression analysis and gene pathway
      inhibition experiments. This mechanism bears remarkable similarity to avian
      feather patterning, suggesting deep homology of the system. We propose that
      a diverse range of vertebrate appendages, from shark denticles to avian feathers
      and mammalian hair, use this ancient and conserved system, with slight genetic

      "title": "Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry",
      "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during
      embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular
      mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that
      tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of
      chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously
      arising from specific chemical interactions (such as \u201cTuring-patterns\u201d).
      Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products
      of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories,
      and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively
      influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus
      on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development.
      On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical
      simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of
      the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical
      behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied
      using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis
      to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development.
      On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even
      simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead
      to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that
      the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories
      are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning

      concept is that thinking is a computational process, then how can computation
      illuminate thinking? It''s a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the buzziest
      AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer systems that learn intelligent
      behavior from massive amounts of data. This is what powers a driverless car,
      for example. In this book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to \"good
      old fashioned artificial intelligence,\" which is based not on heaps of data
      but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind of artificial intelligence
      is equipped to handle situations that depart from previous patterns -- as we
      do in real life, when, for example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when
      the barista informs us there''s no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
      of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that passes the famous
      Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he proposes another way to test
      for intelligence -- the Winograd Schema Test, developed by Levesque and his
      colleagues. \"If our goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we had better
      understand the difference between making it and faking it,\" he observes. He
      identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the capacity to call
      on background knowledge: the ability to represent objects of thought symbolically.
      As AI migrates more and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems
      without common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.", "venue":

      model explains how identical cells can self-organize to form spatial patterns.
      It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different
      diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous
      signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical
      analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals
      that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern
      with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients.
      We provide a software (available at http://www.RDNets.com) to explore these
      networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental
      data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control
      embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how
      existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form
      Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework
      to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use

      estimate species richness if there are many almost undetectable species in a
      hyper\u2010diverse community. Practically, an accurate lower bound for species
      richness is preferable to an inaccurate point estimator. The traditional nonparametric
      lower bound developed by Chao (1984, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11,
      265\u2013270) for individual\u2010based abundance data uses only the information
      on the rarest species (the numbers of singletons and doubletons) to estimate
      the number of undetected species in samples. Applying a modified Good\u2013Turing
      frequency formula, we derive an approximate formula for the first\u2010order
      bias of this traditional lower bound. The approximate bias is estimated by using
      additional information (namely, the numbers of tripletons and quadrupletons).
      This approximate bias can be corrected, and an improved lower bound is thus
      obtained. The proposed lower bound is nonparametric in the sense that it is
      universally valid for any species abundance distribution. A similar type of
      improved lower bound can be derived for incidence data. We test our proposed
      lower bounds on simulated data sets generated from various species abundance
      models. Simulation results show that the proposed lower bounds always reduce
      bias over the traditional lower bounds and improve accuracy (as measured by
      mean squared error) when the heterogeneity of species abundances is relatively
      high. We also apply the proposed new lower bounds to real data for illustration

      power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential
      computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been
      more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number
      of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing
      Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even greater number
      of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its
      memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM
      can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory is relatively
      easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire memory content
      at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement a fast NTM.
      In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to access the memory,
      while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the memory. We call this
      model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access a constant number of
      memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation can be faster.
      The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn programs of unbounded
      running time. We successfully trained the RL-NTM to solve a number of algorithmic
      tasks that are simpler than the ones solvable by the fully differentiable NTM.
      As the RL-NTM is a fairly intricate model, we needed a method for verifying
      the correctness of our implementation. To do so, we developed a simple technique
      for numerically checking arbitrary implementations of models that use Reinforce,

      and injective pseudo random generators. Our results are based on new \"selective

      accumulators that allows for a small commitment to a much larger storage. The
      commitment is unconditionally sound for a select piece of the storage. This
      primitive serves as an \"iO-friendly\" tool that allows us to make two different
      programs equivalent at different stages of a proof. The pieces of storage that
      are selected depend on what hybrid stage we are at in a proof. We first build
      up our enforcement ideas in a simpler context of \"message hiding encodings\"

      "abstract": "Significance Turing proposed that intercellular reaction-diffusion
      of molecules is responsible for morphogenesis. The impact of this paradigm has
      been profound. We exploit an abiological experimental system of emulsion drops
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reactants ideally suited to test Turing\u2019s
      theory. Our experiments verify Turing\u2019s thesis of the chemical basis of
      morphogenesis and reveal a pattern, not previously predicted by theory, which
      we explain by extending Turing\u2019s model to include heterogeneity. Quantitative
      experimental results obtained using this artificial cellular system establish
      the strengths and weaknesses of the Turing model, applicable to biology and
      materials science alike, and pinpoint which directions are required for improvement.
      Alan Turing, in \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d [Turing AM (1952)
      Philos Trans R Soc Lond 237(641):37\u201372], described how, in circular arrays
      of identical biological cells, diffusion can interact with chemical reactions
      to generate up to six periodic spatiotemporal chemical structures. Turing proposed
      that one of these structures, a stationary pattern with a chemically determined
      wavelength, is responsible for differentiation. We quantitatively test Turing\u2019s
      ideas in a cellular chemical system consisting of an emulsion of aqueous droplets
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillatory chemical reactants, dispersed
      in oil, and demonstrate that reaction-diffusion processes lead to chemical differentiation,
      which drives physical morphogenesis in chemical cells. We observe five of the
      six structures predicted by Turing. In 2D hexagonal arrays, a seventh structure
      emerges, incompatible with Turing\u2019s original model, which we explain by
      modifying the theory to include heterogeneity.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "title": "Globally stable microresonator Turing pattern formation for coherent
      high-power THz radiation on-chip", "abstract": "In nonlinear microresonators
      driven by continuous-wave (cw) lasers, Turing patterns have been studied in
      the formalism of Lugiato-Lefever equation with emphasis on its high coherence
      and exceptional robustness against perturbations. Destabilization of Turing
      pattern and transition to spatio-temporal chaos, however, limits the available
      energy carried in the Turing rolls and prevents further harvest of their high
      coherence and robustness to noise. Here we report a novel scheme to circumvent
      such destabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations,
      and attain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear
      oscillators, achieving a record high power conversion efficiency of 45% and
      an elevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern is
      discretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency
      sideband non-uniformity measured at 7.3x10^-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous
      microwave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution stages
      through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free running Turing roll
      coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is transferred onto a
      plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest power THz coherent generation at
      room-temperature, with 1.1% optical-to-THz power conversion. Its long-term stability
      can be further improved by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching an Allan
      deviation of 6x10^-10 at 100 s, with a simple computer-aided slow feedback control.
      The demonstrated on-chip coherent high-power Turing-THz system is promising
      to find applications in astrophysics, medical imaging, and wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "\n \n Penetration testing (pentesting) is a well established method
      for identifying security weaknesses, by conducting friendly attacks. Simulated
      pentesting automates this process, through designing a model of the system at
      hand, and using model-based attack planning to generate the attacks. Classical
      planning variants of this idea are being used commercially by the pentesting
      industry since 2010. Such models can pinpoint potentially dangerous combinations
      of known vulnerabilities, but ignore the incomplete knowledge characteristic
      of hacking from the attacker''s point of view. Yet, ideally, the simulation
      should conduct its attacks the same way a real attacker would. Hence the ultimate
      goal is much more ambitious: to realistically simulate a human hacker. This
      is a grand vision indeed; e.g., the classical Turing Test can be viewed as a
      sub-problem. Taking a more practical perspective, the simulated pentesting model
      space spans a broad range of sequential decision making problems. Analyzing
      prior work in AI and other relevant areas, we derive a systematization of this
      model space, highlighting a multitude of interesting challenges to AI sequential

      "The formation of ordered structures, in particular Turing patterns, in complex
      spatially extended systems has been observed in many different contexts, spanning
      from natural sciences (chemistry, physics, and biology) to technology (mechanics
      and electronics). In this paper, it is shown that the use of memristors in a
      simple cell of a spatially-extended circuit architecture allows us to design
      systems able to generate Turing patterns. In addition, the memristor parameters
      play a key role in the selection of the type and characteristics of the emerging
      pattern, which is also influenced by the initial conditions. The problem of
      finding the regions of parameters where Turing patterns may emerge in the proposed
      cellular architecture is solved in an analytic way, and numerical results are
      shown to illustrate the system behavior with respect to its parameters.", "venue":

      and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
      \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
      For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following
      two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well
      as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to
      a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the
      best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but
      as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all
      symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
      over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant
      of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
      from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
      1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
      at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
      and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "Neural

      "Alan Turing was neither a biologist nor a chemist, and yet the paper he published
      in 1952, \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019, on the spontaneous
      formation of patterns in systems undergoing reaction and diffusion of their
      ingredients has had a substantial impact on both fields, as well as in other
      areas as disparate as geomorphology and criminology. Motivated by the question
      of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such as
      a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random
      fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial uniformity.
      The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far away from its
      equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial
      ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms, of which Turing''s
      model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason, these patterns show
      striking similarities in systems that seem superficially to share nothing in
      common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation on a zebra skin.
      New examples of \u2018Turing patterns'' in biology and beyond are still being
      discovered today. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary

      "title": "Towards a Visual Turing Challenge", "abstract": "As language and visual
      understanding by machines progresses rapidly, we are observing an increasing
      interest in holistic architectures that tightly interlink both modalities in
      a joint learning and inference process. This trend has allowed the community
      to progress towards more challenging and open tasks and refueled the hope at
      achieving the old AI dream of building machines that could pass a turing test
      in open domains. In order to steadily make progress towards this goal, we realize
      that quantifying performance becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore we ask
      how we can precisely define such challenges and how we can evaluate different
      algorithms on this open tasks? In this paper, we summarize and discuss such
      challenges as well as try to give answers where appropriate options are available
      in the literature. We exemplify some of the solutions on a recently presented
      dataset of question-answering task based on real-world indoor images that establishes
      a visual turing challenge. Finally, we argue despite the success of unique ground-truth
      annotation, we likely have to step away from carefully curated dataset and rather
      rely on ''social consensus'' as the main driving force to create suitable benchmarks.
      Providing coverage in this inherently ambiguous output space is an emerging
      challenge that we face in order to make quantifiable progress in this area.",

      "abstract": "Significance Corneal surfaces of some insects are coated with nipple-like
      nanostructures reducing the light reflection. Here we provide an extensive analysis
      of corneae across insect groups. Using atomic force microscopy, we discover
      a striking diversity of corneal nanocoatings, omnipresent in arthropods. These
      fascinating bionanostructures replicate the complete set of the Turing patterns\u2014shapes
      resulting from the reaction\u2212diffusion modeling underlying many examples
      of patterning in biological and physicochemical systems. Our work, verging on
      the interface of nanotechnology and zoology, evolution and biophysics, and ecology
      and genetics, sheds light on the molecular origin and evolutionary diversification
      of a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures. It also describes,
      to our knowledge, the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.
      Nipple-like nanostructures covering the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies,
      and Drosophila have been studied by electron and atomic force microscopy, and
      their antireflective properties have been described. In contrast, corneal nanostructures
      of the majority of other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined
      by methods that did not allow precise morphological characterization. Here we
      provide a comprehensive analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing
      a rich diversity of insect corneal nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are categorized
      into four major morphological patterns and various transitions between them,
      many, to our knowledge, never described before. Remarkably, this unexpectedly
      diverse range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing
      patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled by
      Alan Turing in his famous reaction\u2212diffusion system. These findings reveal
      a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures and shed light on their
      molecular origin and evolutionary diversification. They may also be the first-ever

      have been focused on analyzing the effect of small delays on the pattern formation

      for a delay system in a general form, we propose a technique calculating the
      critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs. Then
      we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern formation
      of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find that when
      the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular patterns,
      which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large delay we find
      spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find that the critical
      delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying capacity to half saturation

      "title": "The Super-Turing Computational Power of plastic Recurrent Neural Networks",
      "abstract": "We study the computational capabilities of a biologically inspired
      neural model where the synaptic weights, the connectivity pattern, and the number
      of neurons can evolve over time rather than stay static. Our study focuses on
      the mere concept of plasticity of the model so that the nature of the updates
      is assumed to be not constrained. In this context, we show that the so-called
      plastic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of the precise super-Turing
      computational power--as the static analog neural networks--irrespective of whether
      their synaptic weights are modeled by rational or real numbers, and moreover,
      irrespective of whether their patterns of plasticity are restricted to bi-valued
      updates or expressed by any other more general form of updating. Consequently,
      the incorporation of only bi-valued plastic capabilities in a basic model of
      RNNs suffices to break the Turing barrier and achieve the super-Turing level
      of computation. The consideration of more general mechanisms of architectural
      plasticity or of real synaptic weights does not further increase the capabilities

      the level of praise that has been lavished on Turing is justified. Yes, the
      1936 paper in which he defined what are now known as Turing machines is a landmark
      in the history of science, but other logicians at the time were involved in
      the development of formal models of computation, including Herbrand, G\u00f6del,
      Post, and Church. And, although Turing played an important part in the development
      of the modern electronic computer, his role should not be overstated: a number
      of early computing devices were built from the late 1930\u2019s to mid-1940\u2019s
      with little or no influence of Turing\u2019s early foundational work, and the
      real history involves a complex mix of theoretical and practical insights, with
      contributions from a substantial cast of researchers and engineers alongside
      Turing. Finally, although the hideous abuses that Turing was subjected to as
      a homosexual in postwar Britain are made even more ironic by the role he played
      in helping the allies win the war, those abuses are no more morally offensive
      than those suffered by countless others whose lives are left uncelebrated. With
      all this in mind, it is reasonable to ask: was all the hoopla really called
      for? One need only sit down with Turing\u2019s work for an hour or two, however,
      to find such doubts pushed aside. His papers are full of technical detail, but
      are surprisingly easy to read. His writing is careful and methodical, but even
      after all these years the work feels creatively fresh and original. He dealt
      with weighty topics and raised important questions, but relied on technical
      mastery and a good deal of hard work to back up his answers. When we read",

      of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from
      a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations
      for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges: Alan had proved that there
      was no \"miraculous machine\" that could solve all mathematical problems, but
      in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea
      of a universal machine that could take over the work of any machine. During
      World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret
      British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German''s Enigma machine code
      was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because
      his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security,
      implemented with machines and remorseless logic: \"It was his own invention,
      and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.\" Andrew Hodges''s remarkable
      insight weaves Turing''s mathematical and computer work with his personal life
      to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek
      Jacobi movie Breaking the Code. Hodges has the mathematical knowledge to explain
      the intellectual significance of Turing''s work, while never losing sight of
      the human and social picture: In this sense his life belied his work, for it
      could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life
      raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the
      body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society,
      the individual and history. And Hodges admits what all biographers know, but
      few admit, about their subjects: \"his inner code remains unbroken.\" Alan Turing

      and biological implementations of Turing patterns, yet this is necessary for
      both understanding and engineering these networks with synthetic biology approaches.
      Here, we model a reaction\u2013diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable
      regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology
      study in mammalian cells.1 The model employs a single promoter to express both
      the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large regions
      of parameter space, using biologically interpretable Hill function reactions.
      We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing biologically
      tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of successful patterning.
      We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time evolution by manipulating
      the values for production and degradation relationships. More importantly, our
      analysis predicts that steep dose\u2013response functions arising from cooperativity
      are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness increases parameter space
      and even reduces the requirement for differential diffusion between activator
      and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some of the limitations of linear scenarios

      "During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing 1912--1954 has been widely
      celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption,
      Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate Turing''s
      motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as
      expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments
      within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In
      particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also
      the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level
      AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine a machine
      which learns like an infant dominates the closing section of the paper, in which
      he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three
      alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: 1 AI by programming,
      2 AI by ab initio machine learning and 3 AI using logic, probabilities, learning
      and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in
      the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We
      compare Turing''s three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude
      with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper.",

      "abstract": "The fractional operator is introduced to an activator-inhibitor
      system to describe species anomalous superdiffusion. The effects of the superdiffusive
      exponent on pattern formation and pattern selection are studied. Our linear
      stability analysis shows that the wave number of the Turing pattern increases
      with the superdiffusive exponent. A weakly nonlinear analysis yields a system
      of amplitude equations and the analysis of these amplitude equations predicts
      parameter regimes where hexagons, stripes, and their coexistence are expected.
      Numerical simulations of the activator-inhibitor model near the stability boundaries
      confirm our analytical results. Since diffusion rate manifests in both diffusion
      constant and diffusion exponent, we numerically explore their interactions on
      the emergence of Turing patterns. When the activator and inhibitor have different
      superdiffusive exponents, we find that the critical ratio of the diffusion rate
      of the inhibitor to the activator, required for the formation of the Turing
      pattern, increases monotonically with the superdiffusive exponent. We conclude
      that small ratio (than unity) of anomalous diffusion exponent between the inhibitor
      and activator is more likely to promote the emergence of the Turing pattern,
      relative to the normal diffusion.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical,

      presents some important issues on misidentification of human interlocutors in
      text-based communication during practical Turing tests. The study here presents
      transcripts in which human judges succumbed to theconfederate effect, misidentifying
      hidden human foils for machines. An attempt is made to assess the reasons for
      this. The practical Turing tests in question were held on 23 June 2012 at Bletchley
      Park, England. A selection of actual full transcripts from the tests is shown
      and an analysis is given in each case. As a result of these tests, conclusions
      are drawn with regard to the sort of strategies which can perhaps lead to erroneous
      conclusions when one is involved as an interrogator. Such results also serve
      to indicate conversational directions to avoid for those machine designers who
      wish to create a conversational entity that performs well on the Turing test.",

      theoretical ideas to people producing actual machines was significant and appreciated
      by everybody involved in computing from the moment he published his 1936 paper
      \u2018On Computable Numbers\u2019. Careful historians are aware that this popular
      conception is deeply misleading. We know from previous work by Campbell-Kelly,
      Aspray, Akera, Olley, Priestley, Daylight, Mounier-Kuhn, Haigh, and others that
      several computing pioneers, including Aiken, Eckert, Mauchly, and Zuse, did
      not depend on (let alone were they aware of) Turing''s 1936 universal-machine
      concept. Furthermore, it is not clear whether any substance in von Neumann''s
      celebrated 1945 \u2018First Draft Report on the EDVAC\u2019 is influenced in
      any identifiable way by Turing''s work. This raises the questions: (i) When
      does Turing enter the field? (ii) Why did the Association for Computing Machinery
      (ACM) honor Turing by associating his name to ACM''s most prestigious award,
      the Turing Award? Previous authors have been rather vague about these questions,
      suggesting some date between 1950 and the early 1960s as the point at which
      Turing is retroactively integrated into the foundations of computing and associating
      him in some way with the movement to develop something that people call computer
      science. In this paper, based on detailed examination of hitherto overlooked
      primary sources, attempts are made to reconstruct networks of scholars and ideas
      prevalent in the 1950s, and to identify a specific group of actors interested
      in theorizing about computations in computers and attracted to the idea of language
      as a frame in which to understand computation. By going back to Turing''s 1936
      paper and, more importantly, to re-cast versions of Turing''s work published
      during the 1950s (Rosenbloom, Kleene, Markov), I identify the factors that made
      this group of scholars particularly interested in Turing''s work and provided
      the original vector by which Turing became to be appreciated in retrospect as
      the father of computer science.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

      of a Turing-Type Mechanism", "abstract": "Digit Determination Pentadactyly has
      been an early and rapid innovation of tetrapods. Sheth et al. (p. 1476) report
      that a dramatic reduction in distally expressed Hox genes, in the absence of
      a functional morphogen signaling pathway, results in extreme polydactyly in
      mice. Mutant digits exhibited patterns reminiscent of the endoskeleton of fins,
      suggesting that an ancestral patterning mechanism has been deeply conserved
      in evolution. Mouse genetics and computer modeling suggest that a reaction-diffusion
      mechanism defines digit pattern. The formation of repetitive structures (such
      as stripes) in nature is often consistent with a reaction-diffusion mechanism,
      or Turing model, of self-organizing systems. We used mouse genetics to analyze
      how digit patterning (an iterative digit/nondigit pattern) is generated. We
      showed that the progressive reduction in Hoxa13 and Hoxd11-Hoxd13 genes (hereafter
      referred to as distal Hox genes) from the Gli3-null background results in progressively
      more severe polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely packed digits. Combined
      with computer modeling, our results argue for a Turing-type mechanism underlying
      digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes modulates the digit
      period or wavelength. The phenotypic similarity with fish-fin endoskeleton patterns
      suggests that the pentadactyl state has been achieved through modification of
      an ancestral Turing-type mechanism.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

      "Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy, homogenous
      initial conditions and have been proposed as patterning mechanism for many developmental
      processes. However, the molecular components that give rise to Turing patterns
      have remained elusive, and the small size of the parameter space that permits
      Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to explain how Turing patterns
      could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing patterns can be obtained with
      a single ligand if the ligand-receptor interaction is taken into account. Here
      we show that the general properties of ligand-receptor systems result in very
      large Turing spaces. Thus, the restriction of receptors to single cells, negative
      feedbacks, regulatory interactions among different ligand-receptor systems,
      and the clustering of receptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the
      Turing space. We further show that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10-SHH
      network that controls lung branching morphogenesis are sufficient to result
      in large Turing spaces. We conclude that the cellular restriction of receptors
      provides a mechanism to sufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to
      make the evolution of Turing patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then
      have further enlarged the Turing space. Given their robustness and flexibility,
      we propose that receptor-ligand-based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism

      nonlinear diffusion on pattern formation in the Brusselator system. Through
      linear stability analysis of the basic solution we determine the Turing and
      the oscillatory instability boundaries. A comparison with the classical linear
      diffusion shows how nonlinear diffusion favors the occurrence of Turing pattern
      formation. We study the process of pattern formation both in one-dimensional
      and two-dimensional spatial domains. Through a weakly nonlinear multiple scales
      analysis we derive the equations for the amplitude of the stationary patterns.
      The analysis of the amplitude equations shows the occurrence of a number of
      different phenomena, including stable supercritical and subcritical Turing patterns
      with multiple branches of stable solutions leading to hysteresis. Moreover,
      we consider traveling patterning waves: When the domain size is large, the pattern
      forms sequentially and traveling wave fronts are the precursors to patterning.
      We derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation and describe the traveling front enveloping
      a pattern which invades the domain. We show the emergence of radially symmetric
      target patterns, and, through a matching procedure, we construct the outer amplitude

      Turing mechanism", "abstract": "The main signalling proteins that control early
      kidney branching have been defined. Yet the underlying mechanism is still elusive.
      We have previously shown that a Schnakenberg-type Turing mechanism can recapitulate
      the branching and protein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant lungs,
      but it is unclear whether this mechanism would extend to other branched organs
      that are regulated by other proteins. Here, we show that the glial cell line-derived
      neurotrophic factor\u2013RET regulatory interaction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type
      Turing model that reproduces the observed budding of the ureteric bud from the
      Wolffian duct, its invasion into the mesenchyme and the observed branching pattern.
      The model also recapitulates all relevant protein expression patterns in wild-type
      and mutant mice. The lung and kidney models are both based on a particular receptor\u2013ligand
      interaction and require (1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2)
      a lower diffusion coefficient for the receptor than for the ligand and (3) an
      increase in the receptor concentration in response to receptor\u2013ligand binding
      (by enhanced transcription, more recycling or similar). These conditions are
      met also by other receptor\u2013ligand systems. We propose that ligand\u2013receptor-based
      Turing patterns represent a general mechanism to control branching morphogenesis
      and other developmental processes.", "venue": "Physical Biology", "year": 2013,

      "title": "The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine", "abstract": "In honor of
      Alan Turing''s hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about one
      of Turing''s obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and free
      will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call \"Knightian freedom\":
      a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic
      unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as
      possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently
      by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries to find scope
      for \"freedom\" in the universe''s boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical
      laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems.
      I investigate how far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the
      way, encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement
      problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb''s
      paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior
      Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations
      of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time,
      quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which
      has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting
      empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old
      philosophical debate into some underexplored territory.", "venue": "The Once

      Neural Text Generation", "abstract": "Recent progress in generative language
      models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts. While
      there are many legitimate applications of such models, there is also a rising
      need to distinguish machine-generated texts from human-written ones (e.g., fake
      news detection). However, to our best knowledge, there is currently no benchmark
      environment with datasets and tasks to systematically study the so-called\"Turing
      Test\"problem for neural text generation methods. In this work, we present the
      TuringBench benchmark environment, which is comprised of (1) a dataset with
      200K human- or machine-generated samples across 20 labels {Human, GPT-1, GPT-2_small,
      GPT-2_medium, GPT-2_large, GPT-2_xl, GPT-2_PyTorch, GPT-3, GROVER_base, GROVER_large,
      GROVER_mega, CTRL, XLM, XLNET_base, XLNET_large, FAIR_wmt19, FAIR_wmt20, TRANSFORMER_XL,
      PPLM_distil, PPLM_gpt2}, (2) two benchmark tasks -- i.e., Turing Test (TT) and
      Authorship Attribution (AA), and (3) a website with leaderboards. Our preliminary
      experimental results using TuringBench show that FAIR_wmt20 and GPT-3 are the
      current winners, among all language models tested, in generating the most human-like
      indistinguishable texts with the lowest F1 score by five state-of-the-art TT
      detection models. The TuringBench is available at: https://turingbench.ist.psu.edu/",

      "title": "Statistically Meaningful Approximation: a Case Study on Approximating
      Turing Machines with Transformers", "abstract": "A common lens to theoretically
      study neural net architectures is to analyze the functions they can approximate.
      However, constructions from approximation theory may be unrealistic and therefore
      less meaningful. For example, a common unrealistic trick is to encode target
      function values using infinite precision. To address these issues, this work
      proposes a formal definition of statistically meaningful (SM) approximation
      which requires the approximating network to exhibit good statistical learnability.
      We study SM approximation for two function classes: boolean circuits and Turing
      machines. We show that overparameterized feedforward neural nets can SM approximate
      boolean circuits with sample complexity depending only polynomially on the circuit
      size, not the size of the network. In addition, we show that transformers can
      SM approximate Turing machines with computation time bounded by $T$ with sample
      complexity polynomial in the alphabet size, state space size, and $\\log (T)$.
      We also introduce new tools for analyzing generalization which provide much
      tighter sample complexities than the typical VC-dimension or norm-based bounds,
      which may be of independent interest.", "venue": "Neural Information Processing

      Region-Induced Deposition Effect of Turing Membrane.", "abstract": "Zinc-based
      batteries are promising for use as energy storage devices owing to their low
      cost and high energy density. However, zinc chemistry commonly encounters serious
      dendrite issues, especially at high areal capacities and current densities,
      limiting their application. Herein, we propose a novel membrane featuring ordered
      undulating stripes called \"Turing patterns\", which can effectively suppress
      zinc dendrites and improve ion conductivity. The crests and troughs in the Turing
      membrane can effectively adjust the Zn(OH)42- distribution and provide more
      zinc deposition space. The coordinated Cu ions during membrane formation can
      interact with Zn(OH)42-, further smoothing zinc deposition. Even at a high current
      density of 80 mA\u00b7cm-2, the Turing membrane enables an alkaline zinc-iron
      flow battery (AZIFB) to work stably with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 160
      mA\u00b7h\u00b7cm-2 for approximately 110 cycles, showing an energy efficiency
      of 90.10%, which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc-based
      batteries with such a high current density. This paper provides valid access

      "title": "Modern perspectives on near-equilibrium analysis of Turing systems",
      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      "Theory of choreographic languages typically includes a number of complex results
      that are proved by structural induction. The high number of cases and the subtle
      details in some of them lead to long reviewing processes, and occasionally to
      errors being found in published proofs. In this work, we take a published proof
      of Turing completeness of a choreographic language and formalise it in Coq.
      Our development includes formalising the choreographic language and its basic
      properties, Kleene''s theory of partial recursive functions, the encoding of
      these functions as choreographies, and proving this encoding correct. \nWith
      this effort, we show that theorem proving can be a very useful tool in the field
      of choreographic languages: besides the added degree of confidence that we get
      from a mechanised proof, the formalisation process led us to a significant simplification
      of the underlying theory. Our results offer a foundation for the future formal

      "Turing patterns have morphed from mathematical curiosities into highly desirable
      targets for synthetic biology. For a long time, their biological significance
      was sometimes disputed but there is now ample evidence for their involvement
      in processes ranging from skin pigmentation to digit and limb formation. While
      their role in developmental biology is now firmly established, their synthetic
      design has so far proved challenging. Here, we review recent large-scale mathematical
      analyses that have attempted to narrow down potential design principles. We
      consider different aspects of robustness of these models and outline why this
      perspective will be helpful in the search for synthetic Turing-patterning systems.
      We conclude by considering robustness in the context of developmental modelling

      "It is becoming increasingly popular for distributed systems to exploit offload
      to reduce load on the CPU. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) offload, in particular,
      has become popular. However, RDMA still requires CPU intervention for complex
      offloads that go beyond simple remote memory access. As such, the offload potential
      is limited and RDMA-based systems usually have to work around such limitations.
      We present RedN, a principled, practical approach to implementing complex RDMA
      offloads, without requiring any hardware modifications. Using self-modifying
      RDMA chains, we lift the existing RDMA verbs interface to a Turing complete
      set of programming abstractions. We explore what is possible in terms of offload
      complexity and performance with a commodity RDMA NIC. We show how to integrate
      these RDMA chains into applications, such as the Memcached key-value store,
      allowing us to offload complex tasks such as key lookups. RedN can reduce the
      latency of key-value get operations by up to 2.6x compared to state-of-the-art
      KV designs that use one-sided RDMA primitives (e.g., FaRM-KV), as well as traditional
      RPC-over-RDMA approaches. Moreover, compared to these baselines, RedN provides
      performance isolation and, in the presence of contention, can reduce latency
      by up to 35x while providing applications with failure resiliency to OS and

      "title": "Studies of Turing pattern formation in zebrafish skin", "abstract":
      "Skin patterns are the first example of the existence of Turing patterns in
      living organisms. Extensive research on zebrafish, a model organism with stripes
      on its skin, has revealed the principles of pattern formation at the molecular
      and cellular levels. Surprisingly, although the networks of cell\u2013cell interactions
      have been observed to satisfy the \u2018short-range activation and long-range
      inhibition\u2019 prerequisites for Turing pattern formation, numerous individual
      reactions were not envisioned based on the classical reaction\u2013diffusion
      model. For example, in real skin, it is not an alteration in concentrations
      of chemicals, but autonomous migration and proliferation of pigment cells that
      establish patterns, and cell\u2013cell interactions are mediated via direct
      contact through cell protrusions. Therefore, the classical reaction\u2013diffusion
      mechanism cannot be used as it is for modelling skin pattern formation. Various
      studies are underway to adapt mathematical models to the experimental findings
      on research into skin patterns, and the purpose of this review is to organize

      While human assessments of such behavior can be highly accurate, speed and scalability

      Turing Test (ANTT) that learns to predict human judgments of human-likeness.
      We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated NTT on a navigation task in
      a complex 3D environment. We investigate six classification models to shed light
      on the types of architectures best suited to this task, and validate them against
      data collected through a human NTT. Our best models achieve high accuracy when
      distinguishing true human and agent behavior. At the same time, we show that
      predicting finer-grained human assessment of agents'' progress towards human-like

      by interfacial polymerization is of great importance in dictating the separation

      structure are generated through facile addition of Zr-based metal-organic framework
      UiO-66-NH2 in the aqueous triethylenetetramine phase. Interestingly, accompanied
      by the degradation of UiO-66-NH2 in aqueous solution, an intermediate complex
      is in situ formed through the strong interaction between the Zr metal center

      and induce a local interfacial reaction, contributing to the generation of a
      homogeneous nanoscale striped Turing structure. The resulting membranes are
      used for CO2/CH4 gas separation. Compared with the parent polyamide membrane

      industrial wastewater, such as the spent fuel reprocessing feed liquid, is of
      great significance for the smooth progress of the subsequent treatment processes.
      Herein, a novel covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with bidirectional
      anisotropic Turing structures is synthesized for the first time and used for
      deacidification. The COF membrane presents linear and hydrophobic properties
      on one side and porous and superhydrophilic properties on the other side, which
      makes the water permeability of hydrophilic side 45 times higher than that of
      the hydrophobic side and effectively prevents the reverse osmosis of water.
      Impressively, the COF membrane has excellent thermal, acid, and irradiation
      stabilities, and an extraordinarily high ability to intercept metal ions in
      a complex multi\u2010ion solution containing 5 m HNO3, with the interception
      rate up to 100%. However, H+ can easily pass through the membrane with the permeation
      flux of 1015.7 mol L\u22121 m\u22122, which realizes the efficient deacidification
      of high acidic solutions. This study provides not only a new idea for the design

      salad poems or chat with humans within narrowly defined topics. Recently, very
      large-scale statistical language models have dramatically advanced the field,
      and GPT-3 is just one example. It can internalize the rules of language without
      explicit programming or rules. Instead, much like a human child, GPT-3 learns
      language through repeated exposure, albeit on a much larger scale. Without explicit
      rules, it can sometimes fail at the simplest of linguistic tasks, but it can
      also excel at more difficult ones like imitating an author or waxing philosophical.",

      is an important problem in the physical, chemical and biological sciences. Turing''s
      contribution, after being initially neglected, eventually catalysed a huge amount
      of work from mathematicians, physicists, chemists and biologists aimed towards
      understanding how steady spatial patterns can emerge from homogeneous chemical
      mixtures due to the reaction and diffusion of different chemical species. While
      this theory has been developed mathematically and investigated experimentally
      for over half a century, many questions still remain unresolved. This theme

      the current frontiers in foundational aspects of pattern formation in reaction-diffusion
      and related systems. It highlights ongoing work in chemical, synthetic and developmental
      settings which is helping to elucidate how important Turing''s mechanism is
      for real morphogenesis, while highlighting gaps that remain in matching theory
      to reality. The theme issue also surveys a variety of recent mathematical research
      pushing the boundaries of Turing''s original theory to more realistic and complicated

      of such models. It aims to consolidate current research frontiers and highlight

      by Using Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Network: Visual Turing Test",
      "abstract": "Background Generative adversarial network (GAN)\u2013based synthetic
      images can be viable solutions to current supervised deep learning challenges.
      However, generating highly realistic images is a prerequisite for these approaches.
      Objective The aim of this study was to investigate and validate the unsupervised
      synthesis of highly realistic body computed tomography (CT) images by using
      a progressive growing GAN (PGGAN) trained to learn the probability distribution
      of normal data. Methods We trained the PGGAN by using 11,755 body CT scans.
      Ten radiologists (4 radiologists with <5 years of experience [Group I], 4 radiologists
      with 5-10 years of experience [Group II], and 2 radiologists with >10 years
      of experience [Group III]) evaluated the results in a binary approach by using
      an independent validation set of 300 images (150 real and 150 synthetic) to
      judge the authenticity of each image. Results The mean accuracy of the 10 readers
      in the entire image set was higher than random guessing (1781/3000, 59.4% vs
      1500/3000, 50.0%, respectively; P<.001). However, in terms of identifying synthetic
      images as fake, there was no significant difference in the specificity between
      the visual Turing test and random guessing (779/1500, 51.9% vs 750/1500, 50.0%,
      respectively; P=.29). The accuracy between the 3 reader groups with different
      experience levels was not significantly different (Group I, 696/1200, 58.0%;
      Group II, 726/1200, 60.5%; and Group III, 359/600, 59.8%; P=.36). Interreader
      agreements were poor (\u03ba=0.11) for the entire image set. In subgroup analysis,
      the discrepancies between real and synthetic CT images occurred mainly in the
      thoracoabdominal junction and in the anatomical details. Conclusions The GAN
      can synthesize highly realistic high-resolution body CT images that are indistinguishable
      from real images; however, it has limitations in generating body images of the
      thoracoabdominal junction and lacks accuracy in the anatomical details.", "venue":

      computing is a non-von Neumann computing paradigm that performs computation
      by emulating the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are extremely energy-efficient
      and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs and GPUs. They
      have the potential to drive critical use cases such as autonomous vehicles,
      edge computing and internet of things in the future. For this reason, they are
      sought to be an indispensable part of the future computing landscape. Neuromorphic
      systems are mainly used for spike-based machine learning applications, although
      there are some non-machine learning applications in graph theory, differential
      equations, and spike-based simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic
      computing might be capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose
      computability of neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this
      work, we prove that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore
      capable of general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic
      computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two synaptic
      parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for computing
      all the \u03bc-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and projection
      functions) and all the \u03bc-recursive operators (i.e., composition, primitive
      recursion and minimization operators). Given that the \u03bc-recursive functions
      and operators are precisely the ones that can be computed using a Turing machine,
      this work establishes the Turing-completeness of neuromorphic computing.", "venue":

      manifold of high dimension on which the time-dependent Euler equations are Turing

      is equivalent to a certain global solution of the Euler equations entering a
      certain open set in the space of divergence-free vector fields. In particular,
      this implies the undecidability of whether a solution to the Euler equations
      with an initial datum will reach a certain open set or not in the space of divergence-free
      fields. This result goes one step further in Tao\u2019s programme to study the

      in particular has made significant contributions to the study of Turing-type
      morphogenesis, providing multiple reproducible experimental methods to both

      in the study of the Turing mechanism, summarize the numerous insights chemical
      systems have yielded into both the dynamics and the morphological behaviour

      analysis provides a system constituting amplitude equations and its related
      analysis is capable of predicting parameter regimes with different patterns
      expected to co-exist in dynamical circumstances that exhibit complex fractional-order
      system characteristics. The Turing mechanism of pattern formation as a result
      of diffusion-induced instability of the homogeneous steady state is concerned
      with unpredictable conditions. The Turing instability caused by fractional diffusion
      in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus model has been addressed in this study. It
      is important that the effect of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus to the immune
      system can be modeled by the interaction of uninfected cells, unhealthy cells,
      virus particles and antigen-specific. Initially, all potential equilibrium points
      are defined and the stability of the interior equilibrium point is then evaluated
      using the Routh\u2013Hurwitz criteria. The conditions for Turing instability
      are obtained by local equilibrium points with stability analysis. In the neighborhood
      of the Turing bifurcation point, weakly nonlinear analysis is employed to deduce
      the amplitude equations. After applying amplitude equations, it is observed
      that this system has a very rich dynamical behavior. The constraints for the
      formation of the patterns like a hexagon, spot, mixed and stripe patterns are
      identified for the amplitude equations by dynamic analysis. Furthermore, by
      using the numerical simulations, the theoretical results are verified. Within

      perspective and bifurcation point based on the viral death rate can provide

      "Abstract Consider a finite sample from an unknown distribution over a countable
      alphabet. The missing mass refers to the probability of symbols that do not
      appear in the sample. Estimating the missing mass is a basic problem in statistics
      and related fields, which dates back to the early work of Laplace, and the more
      recent seminal contribution of Good and Turing. In this article, we introduce
      a generalized Good-Turing (GT) framework for missing mass estimation. We derive
      an upper-bound for the risk (in terms of mean squared error) and minimize it
      over the parameters of our framework. Our analysis distinguishes between two
      setups, depending on the (unknown) alphabet size. When the alphabet size is
      bounded from above, our risk-bound demonstrates a significant improvement compared
      to currently known results (which are typically oblivious to the alphabet size).
      Based on this bound, we introduce a numerically obtained estimator that improves
      upon GT. When the alphabet size holds no restrictions, we apply our suggested
      risk-bound and introduce a closed-form estimator that again improves GT performance
      guarantees. Our suggested framework is easy to apply and does not require additional
      modeling assumptions. This makes it a favorable choice for practical applications.

      want to learn about code primarily to communicate with technical co-workers,
      not to develop software. However, existing instructional materials don\u2019t
      meet the needs of conversational programmers because they prioritize syntax
      and semantics over concepts and applications. This mismatch results in feelings
      of failure and low self-efficacy. To motivate conversational programmers, we
      propose purpose-first programming, a new approach that focuses on learning a
      handful of domain-specific code patterns and assembling them to create authentic
      and useful programs. We report on the development of a purpose-first programming
      prototype that teaches five patterns in the domain of web scraping. We show
      that learning with purpose-first programming is motivating for conversational
      programmers because it engenders a feeling of success and aligns with these
      learners\u2019 goals. Purpose-first programming learning enabled novice conversational
      programmers to complete scaffolded code writing, debugging, and explaining activities

      Codes", "abstract": "Proving a capacity result usually involves two parts: achievability
      and converse which establish matching lower and upper bounds on the capacity.
      For achievability, only the existence of good (capacity-achieving) codes is
      usually shown. Although the existence of such optimal codes is known, constructing
      such capacity-achieving codes has been open for a long time. Recently, significant
      progress has been made and optimal code constructions have been found including
      for example polar codes. A crucial observation is that all these constructions
      are done for a fixed and given channel and this paper addresses the question
      whether or not it is possible to find universal algorithms that can construct
      optimal codes for a whole class of channels. For this purpose, the concept of
      Turing machines is used which provides the fundamental performance limits of
      digital computers. It is shown that there exists no universal Turing machine
      that takes the channel from the class of interest as an input and outputs optimal
      codes. Finally, implications on channel-aware transmission schemes are discussed.",

      imitation game", "abstract": "Can machines think? I present a study of Alan
      Turing\u2019s iconic imitation game or test and its central question. Seventy
      years of commentary has been produced about Turing\u2019s 1950 proposal. The
      now legendary \u201cTuring test\u201d has grown a life of its own in the tradition
      of analytic philosophy with at best loose ties to the historical imitation tests
      (1948-1952) posed by Turing. I shall examine the historical and epistemological
      roots of Turing\u2019s various versions of imitation game or test and make the
      case that they came out from within a dialogue, in fact a scientific controversy,
      most notably with physicist and computer pioneer Douglas Hartree, chemist and
      philosopher Michael Polanyi, and neurosurgeon Geoffrey Jefferson. Placing Turing\u2019s
      views in their historical, social and cultural context, I shall reclaim their
      scientific and philosophical value for the sake of the discussion in the years
      to come. My study is organized according to three main philosophical problems
      whose analyses are backed by a subsidiary chronology of the concept of machine
      intelligence in Turing\u2019s thought (1936-1952). \n \nThe first problem I
      will address is the identification of Turing\u2019s specific ambition which
      led him to announce that machines will think. War hero and brilliant mathematician,
      he challenged the conventional wisdom of what machines really were or could
      be and prophesized a future pervaded by intelligent machines which may be seen
      as a dystopia just as much as a utopia. I shall examine Turing\u2019s profile
      and take special interest in the way he was seen by his contenders. \nIn the
      second problem, over and above the mere proposal of a test for machine intelligence,
      I will study Turing\u2019s proposition \u201cmachines can think\u201d and its
      implied existential hypothesis \u2014 \u201cthere exists (will exist) a thinking
      machine\u201d \u2014 from a point of view of the history of the philosophy of
      science. Unlike traditional readings of Turing, I found that Turing held a non-obvious
      realist attitude towards the existence of a mechanical mindbrain which he conjectured
      to frame the human and whose digital replica he intended to build in the machine.
      \n \nTuring\u2019s 1950 paper has been acknowledged as a complex and multi-layered
      text. Opposing views can be identified in the literature relative to the question
      on whether or not Turing proposed his imitation test as an experiment to decide
      for machine intelligence. I shall call this the Turing test dilemma and address
      it as my third and main problem. My findings suggest that Turing cannot have
      proposed his imitation game as something other than a thought experiment. And
      yet its critical and heuristic functions within the mind-machine controversy
      are striking.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

      model of computation (1936) is explicated in terms of the potential operations

      is based on indistinguishability from human verbal behaviour. But this chapter
      challenges the apparent human-centredness of the 1936 model, suggesting a focus
      instead on mathematical concepts, with human comparisons making an entrance
      only retrospectively. The 1950 account of intelligence also turns out to be
      far less human-centred than it initially appears to be, because the universality
      of computation makes human intelligence just one variety amongst many. It is
      only when Turing considers consciousness that he treats intelligence in a way
      that cannot properly be carried over to machines. But here he is mistaken, since
      his own work gave ample reason to reinterpret intelligence as sophisticated
      information processing for some purpose, and to divorce this from the subjective

      in autonomous vehicle simulation and\ntesting are not sufficiently smart and
      can hardly reflect human-like\nbehaviors in real world driving scenarios. To
      further improve the\ntechnology, in this work we present a novel hierarchical\ngame-theoretical
      framework to represent naturalistic multi-modal\ninteractions among road users
      in simulation and testing, which is then\nvalidated by the Turing test. Given
      that human drivers have no access to\nthe complete information of the surrounding
      road users, the Bayesian\ngame theory is utilized to model the decision-making
      process. Then, a\nprobing behavior is generated by the proposed game theoretic
      model, and\nis further applied to control the vehicle via Markov chain. To validate\nthe
      feasibility and effectiveness, the proposed method is tested through\na series
      of experiments and compared with existing approaches. In\naddition, Turing tests
      are conducted to quantify the human-likeness of\nthe proposed algorithm. The

      University under the direction of Alonzo Church, the doyen of American logicians.

      results of the thesis were published in 1939 under the title \u201cSystems of

      deal with the natural idea of overcoming the G\u00f6delian incompleteness of
      formal systems by iterating the adjunction of statements\u2014 such as the consistency
      of the system\u2014that \u201cought to\u201d have been accepted but were not

      as octopi and squid can purposefully and rapidly change their skin color. Furthermore,
      it is widely known that some octopi have the ability to rapidly change the color
      and unevenness of their skin to mimic their surroundings. However, there has
      been little research published on the mechanisms by which an octopus recognizes
      its surrounding landscape and changes its skin pattern. We are unaware of any
      hypothetical model that explains this mimicry mechanism to date. In this study,
      the mechanism of octopus skin pattern change was assumed to be based on the
      Turing pattern model. Here, pattern formation using the Turing model was realized
      using an equivalent filter calculation model and a cellular automaton instead
      of directly solving the differential equations. It was shown that this model
      can create various patterns using two feature parameters. Furthermore, for visual
      recognition where two features are extracted from the Turing pattern image,
      a method that requires minimal calculation using the characteristics of the
      cellular Turing pattern model is proposed. These two calculations can be expressed
      in the same mathematical frame based on the cellular automaton model using a
      convolution filter. As a result, a model that is capable of extracting features
      from patterns and reconstructing those patterns rapidly can be created. This
      represents a basic model of the mimicry mechanism of octopi. Further, this study
      demonstrates the potential for creating a model with minimal learning calculation

      "title": "A Turing Test for Transparency", "abstract": "A central goal of explainable
      artificial intelligence (XAI) is to improve the trust relationship in human-AI
      interaction. One assumption underlying research in transparent AI systems is
      that explanations help to better assess predictions of machine learning (ML)
      models, for instance by enabling humans to identify wrong predictions more efficiently.
      Recent empirical evidence however shows that explanations can have the opposite
      effect: When presenting explanations of ML predictions humans often tend to
      trust ML predictions even when these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests
      that this effect can be attributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation
      appears. This effect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible
      usage of transparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish
      machine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative metric
      for XAI methods based on Turing''s imitation game, a Turing Test for Transparency.
      A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was generated
      by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can not be
      detected by humans above chance performance in this binary classification task
      are passing the test. Detecting such explanations is a requirement for assessing
      and calibrating the trust relationship in human-AI interaction. We present experimental
      results on a crowd-sourced text classification task demonstrating that even
      for basic ML models and XAI approaches most participants were not able to differentiate
      human from machine generated explanations. We discuss ethical and practical
      implications of our results for applications of transparent ML.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "abstract": "The Turing test centers on the idea that if a computer could trick
      a human into believing that it was human, then the machine was deemed to be
      intelligent or indistinguishable from people. Designing a visual Turing test
      involves recognizing objects and their relationships on images and creating
      a method to derive new concepts from the visual information. Until now, the
      proposed visual tests heavily use natural language processing to conduct the
      questionnaire or storytelling. We deviate from the mainstream, and we propose
      to reframe the visual Turing test through the Kuleshov effect to avoid written
      or spoken language. The idea resides on elucidating a method that creates the
      concept of montage synthetically. Like the first days of cinema, we would like
      to convey messages with the interpretation of image shots that a machine could
      decipher while comparing it with those scored by humans. The first implementation
      of this new test uses images from a psychology study where the circumplex model
      is applied to rate each image. We consider five deep learning methodologies
      and eight optimizers, and through semiotics, we derive an emotional state in
      the computer. The results are promising since we confirm that this version of
      the visual Turing test is challenging as a new research avenue.", "venue": "2021

      mechanism", "abstract": "Cell patterning in epithelia is critical for the establishment
      of tissue function during development. The organization of patterns in these
      tissues is mediated by the interpretation of signals operating across multiple
      length scales. How epithelial tissues coordinate changes in cell identity across
      these length scales to orchestrate cellular rearrangements and fate specification
      remains poorly understood. Here, we use human neural tube organoids as model
      systems to interrogate epithelial patterning principles that guide domain specification.
      In silico modeling of the patterning process by cellular automata, validated
      by in vitro experiments, reveal that the initial positions of floor plate cells,
      coupled with activator-inhibitor signaling interactions, deterministically dictate
      the patterning outcome according to a discretized Turing reaction-diffusion
      mechanism. This model predicts an enhancement of organoid patterning by modulating
      inhibitor levels. Receptor-ligand interaction analysis of scRNAseq data from
      multiple organoid domains reveals WNT-pathway ligands as the specific inhibitory
      agents, thereby allowing for the experimental validation of model predictions.
      These results demonstrate that neuroepithelia employ reaction-diffusion-based
      mechanisms during early embryonic human development to organize cellular identities
      and morphogen sources to achieve patterning. The wider implementation of such
      in vitro organoid models in combination with in-silico agent-based modeling
      coupled to receptor-ligand analysis of scRNAseq data opens avenues for a broader

      20 February, 2021 Online: 10 March, 2021 This study attempts to develop theoretical
      criteria for verifying the morality of the actions of artificial intelligent
      agents, using the Turing test as an archetype and inspiration. This study develops
      ethical criteria established based on Kohlberg\u2019s moral development theory
      that might help determine the types of moral acts committed by artificial intelligent
      agents. Subsequently, it leverages these criteria in a test experiment with
      Korean children aged around ten years. The study concludes that the 10-year-old
      test participants\u2019 stage of moral development falls between the first and
      second types of moral acts in moral Turing tests. We evaluate the moral behavior
      type experiment by applying it to Korean elementary school students aged about
      ten years old. Moreover, this study argues that if a similar degree of reaction
      is obtained by applying this experiment to future healthcare robots, this healthcare
      robot can be recognized as passing the moral Turing test.", "venue": "", "year":

      a programmable Turing machine, uses the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillatory

      that the time interval is a non-trivial design parameter, whose choice should

      patterns have been extensively studied in configurations that can be modelled
      by the Lugiato-Lefever equation. Typically, such schemes are implemented experimentally
      by resonant coupling of a continuous wave laser to a Kerr microcavity in order
      to generate highly coherent and robust waves. Here, we study the formation of
      such patterns in a system composed of a microresonator nested in an amplifying
      laser cavity, a scheme recently used to demonstrate laser cavity solitons with
      high optical efficiency and easy repetition rate control. Utilizing this concept,
      we study different regimes of Turing patterns, unveiling their formation dynamics
      and demonstrating their controllability and robustness. By conducting a comprehensive
      modulational instability study with a mean-field model of the system, we explain
      the pattern formation in terms of its evolution from background noise, paving
      the way towards complete self-starting operation. Our theoretical and experimental
      paper provides a clear pathway for repetition rate control of these waves over
      both fine (Megahertz) and large (Gigahertz) scales, featuring a fractional frequency

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "abstract": "A classical reaction-diffusion system, the Schnakenberg system,
      is under consideration in a bounded domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^m$ with
      Neumann boundary conditions. We study diffusion-driven instability of a stationary
      spatially homogeneous solution of this system, also called the Turing instability,
      which arises when the diffusion coefficient $d$ changes. An analytical description
      of the region of necessary and sufficient conditions for the Turing instability
      in the parameter plane is obtained by analyzing the linearized system in diffusionless
      and diffusion approximations. It is shown that one of the boundaries of the
      region of necessary conditions is an envelope of the family of curves that bound
      the region of sufficient conditions. Moreover, the intersection points of two
      consecutive curves of this family lie on a straight line whose slope depends
      on the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator and does not depend on the diffusion
      coefficient. We find an analytical expression for the critical diffusion coefficient
      at which the stability of the equilibrium position of the system is lost. We
      derive conditions under which the set of wavenumbers corresponding to neutral
      stability modes is countable, finite, or empty. It is shown that the semiaxis
      $d>1$ can be represented as a countable union of half-intervals with split points

      in optical Kerr microresonators have been used in the generation of optical
      frequency combs and the synthesis of microwave and terahertz frequencies. In
      this work, by applying electro-optic modulation on terahertz-frequency Turing
      rolls, we implement electro-optic frequency division with a microcomb to synthesize
      variable low-noise microwave signals. We also actively stabilize the terahertz
      oscillations to a microwave reference via intracavity power modulation, obtaining
      fractional frequency instabilities that are better than those of the free-running
      situation by up to six orders of magnitude. This study not only highlights the
      extraordinary spectral purity of Turing roll oscillations but also opens the
      way for bidirectional terahertz-to-microwave links with hybrid optical frequency
      comb techniques.", "venue": "Physical Review A", "year": 2021, "referenceCount":

      and dimension. We also explain geometric and topological conditions that make

      techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort
      between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest
      monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG),
      with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure
      as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed
      and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
      corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
      to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results,
      as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
      We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
      accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.
      We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale
      training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language
      generations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount":

      was intelligent: could a machine imitate a human so well that its answers to
      questions were indistinguishable from a human''s? Ever since, creating intelligence
      that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of
      thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like
      artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure,
      and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our own minds. But not
      all types of AI are human-like-in fact, many of the most powerful systems are
      very different from humans-and an excessive focus on developing and deploying
      HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human
      labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly
      dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused
      on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to
      insist on a share of the value created. What is more, augmentation creates new
      capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value
      than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial,
      there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation
      among technologists, business executives, and policy-makers.", "venue": "Daedalus",

      "title": "Large Language Models and the Reverse Turing Test", "abstract": "Abstract
      Large language models (LLMs) have been transformative. They are pretrained foundational
      models that are self-supervised and can be adapted with fine-tuning to a wide
      range of natural language tasks, each of which previously would have required
      a separate network model. This is one step closer to the extraordinary versatility
      of human language. GPT-3 and, more recently, LaMDA, both of them LLMs, can carry
      on dialogs with humans on many topics after minimal priming with a few examples.
      However, there has been a wide range of reactions and debate on whether these
      LLMs understand what they are saying or exhibit signs of intelligence. This
      high variance is exhibited in three interviews with LLMs reaching wildly different
      conclusions. A new possibility was uncovered that could explain this divergence.
      What appears to be intelligence in LLMs may in fact be a mirror that reflects
      the intelligence of the interviewer, a remarkable twist that could be considered
      a reverse Turing test. If so, then by studying interviews, we may be learning
      more about the intelligence and beliefs of the interviewer than the intelligence
      of the LLMs. As LLMs become more capable, they may transform the way we interact
      with machines and how they interact with each other. Increasingly, LLMs are
      being coupled with sensorimotor devices. LLMs can talk the talk, but can they
      walk the walk? A road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined
      with seven major improvements inspired by brain systems and how LLMs could in
      turn be used to uncover new insights into brain function.", "venue": "Neural

      "abstract": "Chirality in biomolecules is ubiquitous in our world, but oral
      nanomedicines constructed from chiral peptides are extremely rare, principally
      because of the immature nanofabrication and inadequate bioavailability of chiral
      nanostructures. Methods: To realize the oral administration of chiral peptides
      and break through their forbidden zone in intracellular space, a chiral-peptide
      supramolecular (DPAICP) camouflaging with the membrane from milk-derived extracellular
      vesicles (ME) was developed herein through an aqueous-based growth method of
      chiral peptide Au(I) infinite covalent polymer (DPAICP) involving in organothiol
      D-peptides and Au3+, and a feasible camouflage technology using ME. Results:
      DPAICP@ME possessed favorable pharmaceutical properties to remain stable during
      the gastrointestinal absorption and blood circulation, and showed the satisfactory
      tumor accumulation through oral medication. Expectedly, oral DPAICP@ME played
      its predetermined role in vivo to restore p53 signaling pathway for cancer therapy

      a property of biological systems, and in animals (including humans), behavioral
      variability is characterized by certain features, such as the range of variability
      and the shape of its distribution. Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated
      whether and how variability features contribute to the ascription of humanness
      to robots in a human-robot interaction setting. Here, we tested whether two
      aspects of behavioral variability, namely, the standard deviation and the shape
      of distribution of reaction times, affect the ascription of humanness to robots
      during a joint action scenario. We designed an interactive task in which pairs
      of participants performed a joint Simon task with an iCub robot placed by their
      side. Either iCub could perform the task in a preprogrammed manner, or its button
      presses could be teleoperated by the other member of the pair, seated in the
      other room. Under the preprogrammed condition, the iCub pressed buttons with
      reaction times falling within the range of human variability. However, the distribution
      of the reaction times did not resemble a human-like shape. Participants were
      sensitive to humanness, because they correctly detected the human agent above
      chance level. When the iCub was controlled by the computer program, it passed

      "Diffusion-driven instabilities with pattern formation may occur in a network
      of identical, regularly-spaced, and resistively-coupled cells if and only if
      the uncoupled cell is poised on a locally-active and stable operating point
      in the Edge of Chaos domain. This manuscript presents the simplest ever-reported
      two-cell neural network, combining together only 7 two-terminal components,
      namely 2 batteries, 3 resistors, and 2 volatile NbOx memristive threshold switches
      from NaMLab, and subject to diffusion-driven instabilities with the concurrent
      emergence of Turing patterns. Very remarkably, this is the first time an homogeneous
      cellular medium, with no other dynamic element than 2 locally-active memristors,
      hence the attribute all-memristor coined to address it in this paper, is found
      to support complex phenomena. The destabilization of the homogeneous solution
      occurs in this second-order two-cell array if and only if the uncoupled cell
      circuit parameters are chosen from the Edge of Chaos domain. A deep circuit-
      and system-theoretic investigation, including linearization analysis and phase
      portrait investigation, provides a comprehensive picture for the local and global
      dynamics of the bio-inspired network, revealing how a theory-assisted approach
      may guide circuit design with inherently non-linear memristive devices.", "venue":

      Neural Text Generation", "abstract": "Recent progress in generative language
      models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts. While
      there are many legitimate applications of such models, there is also a rising
      need to distinguish machine-generated texts from human-written ones (e.g., fake
      news detection). However, to our best knowledge, there is currently no benchmark
      environment with datasets and tasks to systematically study the so-called\"Turing
      Test\"problem for neural text generation methods. In this work, we present the
      TuringBench benchmark environment, which is comprised of (1) a dataset with
      200K human- or machine-generated samples across 20 labels {Human, GPT-1, GPT-2_small,
      GPT-2_medium, GPT-2_large, GPT-2_xl, GPT-2_PyTorch, GPT-3, GROVER_base, GROVER_large,
      GROVER_mega, CTRL, XLM, XLNET_base, XLNET_large, FAIR_wmt19, FAIR_wmt20, TRANSFORMER_XL,
      PPLM_distil, PPLM_gpt2}, (2) two benchmark tasks -- i.e., Turing Test (TT) and
      Authorship Attribution (AA), and (3) a website with leaderboards. Our preliminary
      experimental results using TuringBench show that FAIR_wmt20 and GPT-3 are the
      current winners, among all language models tested, in generating the most human-like
      indistinguishable texts with the lowest F1 score by five state-of-the-art TT
      detection models. The TuringBench is available at: https://turingbench.ist.psu.edu/",

      Turing Machines with Transformers", "abstract": "A common lens to theoretically
      study neural net architectures is to analyze the functions they can approximate.
      However, constructions from approximation theory may be unrealistic and therefore
      less meaningful. For example, a common unrealistic trick is to encode target
      function values using infinite precision. To address these issues, this work
      proposes a formal definition of statistically meaningful (SM) approximation
      which requires the approximating network to exhibit good statistical learnability.
      We study SM approximation for two function classes: boolean circuits and Turing
      machines. We show that overparameterized feedforward neural nets can SM approximate
      boolean circuits with sample complexity depending only polynomially on the circuit
      size, not the size of the network. In addition, we show that transformers can
      SM approximate Turing machines with computation time bounded by $T$ with sample
      complexity polynomial in the alphabet size, state space size, and $\\log (T)$.
      We also introduce new tools for analyzing generalization which provide much
      tighter sample complexities than the typical VC-dimension or norm-based bounds,
      which may be of independent interest.", "venue": "Neural Information Processing

      A Bayesian Game\u2010Theoretic Approach with Turing Test", "abstract": "Interacting
      with surrounding road users is a key feature of autonomous vehicles and is critical
      for their intelligence testing. Existing interaction modalities in autonomous
      vehicle simulation and testing are not sufficiently smart, and they barely reflect
      human\u2010like behaviors in real\u2010world driving scenarios. Therefore, a
      novel hierarchical game\u2010theoretical framework is presented to represent
      naturalistic multimodal interactions among road users during simulation and
      testing, which is subsequently validated by the Turing test. Given that human
      drivers have no access to the complete information of the surrounding road users,
      the Bayesian game theory is used to model the decision\u2010making process.
      Next, a probing behavior is generated by the proposed game\u2010theoretic model,
      and is further applied to control the vehicle via the Markov chain. The proposed
      method is tested through a series of experiments and compared with existing
      approaches. In addition, Turing tests are conducted to quantify the human\u2010likeness
      of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed Bayesian
      game\u2010theoretic framework can effectively generate representative scenes
      of human\u2010like decision\u2010making during autonomous vehicle interactions,
      demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. An interactive preprint version

      "Proof systems allow one party to prove to another party that a certain statement
      is true. Most existing practical proof systems require that the statement will
      be represented in terms of polynomial equations over a finite field. This makes
      the process of representing a statement that one wishes to prove or verify rather
      complicated, as this process requires a new set of equations for each statement.
      Various approaches to deal with this problem have been proposed, see for example
      [1]. We present Cairo, a practically-efficient Turing-complete STARK-friendly
      CPU architecture. We describe a single set of polynomial equations for the statement
      that the execution of a program on this architecture is valid. Given a statement
      one wishes to prove, Cairo allows writing a program that describes that statement,
      instead of writing a set of polynomial equations.", "venue": "IACR Cryptology

      Region-Induced Deposition Effect of Turing Membrane.", "abstract": "Zinc-based
      batteries are promising for use as energy storage devices owing to their low
      cost and high energy density. However, zinc chemistry commonly encounters serious
      dendrite issues, especially at high areal capacities and current densities,
      limiting their application. Herein, we propose a novel membrane featuring ordered
      undulating stripes called \"Turing patterns\", which can effectively suppress
      zinc dendrites and improve ion conductivity. The crests and troughs in the Turing
      membrane can effectively adjust the Zn(OH)42- distribution and provide more
      zinc deposition space. The coordinated Cu ions during membrane formation can
      interact with Zn(OH)42-, further smoothing zinc deposition. Even at a high current
      density of 80 mA\u00b7cm-2, the Turing membrane enables an alkaline zinc-iron
      flow battery (AZIFB) to work stably with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 160
      mA\u00b7h\u00b7cm-2 for approximately 110 cycles, showing an energy efficiency
      of 90.10%, which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc-based
      batteries with such a high current density. This paper provides valid access
      to zinc-based batteries with high areal capacities based on membrane design

      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      "title": "One-Tape Turing Machine and Branching Program Lower Bounds for MCSP",
      "abstract": "For a size parameter s : N \u2192 N, the Minimum Circuit Size Problem
      (denoted by MCSP[s(n)]) is the problem of deciding whether the minimum circuit
      size of a given function f : {0, 1} \u2192 {0, 1} (represented by a string of
      length N := 2) is at most a threshold s(n). A recent line of work exhibited
      \u201chardness magnification\u201d phenomena for MCSP: A very weak lower bound
      for MCSP implies a breakthrough result in complexity theory. For example, McKay,
      Murray, and Williams (STOC 2019) implicitly showed that, for some constant \u03bc1
      > 0, if MCSP[2\u03bc1\u00b7n] cannot be computed by a one-tape Turing machine
      (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) running in time N1.01, then
      P 6= NP. In this paper, we present the following new lower bounds against one-tape
      Turing machines and branching programs: 1. A randomized two-sided error one-tape
      Turing machine (with an additional one-way read-only input tape) cannot compute
      MCSP[2\u03bc2\u00b7n] in time N1.99, for some constant \u03bc2 > \u03bc1. 2.
      A non-deterministic (or parity) branching program of size o(N1.5/ logN) cannot
      compute MKTP, which is a time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity analogue of MCSP.
      This is shown by directly applying the Nechiporuk method to MKTP, which previously
      appeared to be difficult. These results are the first non-trivial lower bounds
      for MCSP and MKTP against one-tape Turing machines and non-deterministic branching
      programs, and essentially match the best-known lower bounds for any explicit
      functions against these computational models. The first result is based on recent
      constructions of pseudorandom generators for read-once oblivious branching programs
      (ROBPs) and combinatorial rectangles (Forbes and Kelley, FOCS 2018; Viola 2019).
      En route, we obtain several related results: 1. There exists a (local) hitting
      set generator with seed length \u00d5( \u221a N) secure against read-once polynomial-size
      non-deterministic branching programs on N -bit inputs. 2. Any read-once co-non-deterministic
      branching program computing MCSP must have size at least 2\u03a9\u0303(N). 2012

      discussed the concept of using a form of Turing\u2010like test for model evaluation,
      together with eight principles for implementing such an approach. In this part,
      the framing of fitness\u2010for\u2010purpose as a Turing\u2010like test is discussed,
      together with an example application of trying to assess whether a rainfall\u2010runoff
      model might be an adequate representation of the discharge response in a catchment
      for predicting future natural flood management scenarios. It is shown that the
      variation between event runoff coefficients in the record can be used to create
      some limits of acceptability that implicitly take some account of the epistemic
      uncertainties arising from lack of knowledge about errors in rainfall and discharge
      observations. In the case study it is demonstrated that the model used cannot
      be validated in this way across all the range of observed discharges, but that
      behavioural models can be found for the peak flows that are the subject of interest
      in the application. Thinking in terms of the Turing\u2010like test focusses
      attention on the critical observations needed to test whether streamflow is
      being produced in the right way so that a model is considered as fit\u2010for\u2010purpose

      Turing test has been used to investigate whether machines have intelligence
      similar to humans. Our study aimed to assess the ability of an artificial intelligence
      (AI) system for spine tumor detection using the Turing test. Methods Our retrospective
      study data included 12179 images from 321 patients for developing AI detection
      systems and 6635 images from 187 patients for the Turing test. We utilized a
      deep learning-based tumor detection system with Faster R-CNN architecture, which
      generates region proposals by Region Proposal Network in the first stage and
      corrects the position and the size of the bounding box of the lesion area in
      the second stage. Each choice question featured four bounding boxes enclosing
      an identical tumor. Three were detected by the proposed deep learning model,
      whereas the other was annotated by a doctor; the results were shown to six doctors
      as respondents. If the respondent did not correctly identify the image annotated
      by a human, his answer was considered a misclassification. If all misclassification
      rates were >30%, the respondents were considered unable to distinguish the AI-detected
      tumor from the human-annotated one, which indicated that the AI system passed
      the Turing test. Results The average misclassification rates in the Turing test
      were 51.2% (95% CI: 45.7%\u201357.5%) in the axial view (maximum of 62%, minimum
      of 44%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 38.2%\u201351.8%) in the sagittal view (maximum of
      59%, minimum of 36%). The misclassification rates of all six respondents were
      >30%; therefore, our AI system passed the Turing test. Conclusion Our proposed

      Using Generative Adversarial Network: Visual Turing Test", "abstract": "(1)
      Introduction: Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      play an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of spinal diseases, especially
      degenerative spinal diseases. MRI is mainly used to diagnose most spinal diseases
      because it shows a higher resolution than CT to distinguish lesions of the spinal
      canals and intervertebral discs. When it is inevitable for CT to be selected
      instead of MR in evaluating spinal disease, evaluation of spinal disease may
      be limited. In these cases, it is very helpful to diagnose spinal disease with
      MR images synthesized with CT images. (2) Objective: To create synthetic lumbar
      magnetic resonance (MR) images from computed tomography (CT) scans using generative
      adversarial network (GAN) models and assess how closely the synthetic images
      resembled the true images using visual Turing tests (VTTs). (3) Material and
      Methods: Overall, 285 patients aged \u2265 40 years who underwent lumbar CT
      and MRI were enrolled. Based on axial CT and T2-weighted axial MR images from
      285 patients, an image synthesis model using a GAN was trained using three algorithms
      (unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised methods). Furthermore, VTT to
      determine how similar the synthetic lumbar MR images generated from lumbar CT
      axial images were to the true lumbar MR axial images were conducted with 59
      patients who were not included in the model training. For the VTT, we designed
      an evaluation form comprising 600 randomly distributed axial images (150 true
      and 450 synthetic images from unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised
      methods). Four readers judged the authenticity of each image and chose their
      first- and second-choice candidates for the true image. In addition, for the
      three models, structural similarities (SSIM) were evaluated and the peak signal
      to noise ratio (PSNR) was compared among the three methods. (4) Results: The
      mean accuracy for the selection of true images for all four readers for their
      first choice was 52.0% (312/600). The accuracies of determining the true image
      for each reader\u2019s first and first + second choices, respectively, were
      as follows: reader 1, 51.3% and 78.0%; reader 2, 38.7% and 62.0%, reader 3,
      69.3% and 84.0%, and reader 4, 48.7% and 70.7%. In the case of synthetic images
      chosen as first and second choices, supervised algorithm-derived images were
      the most often selected (supervised, 118/600 first and 164/600 second; semi-supervised,
      90/600 and 144/600; and unsupervised, 80/600 and 114/600). For image quality,
      the supervised algorithm received the best score (PSNR: 15.987 \u00b1 1.039,
      SSIM: 0.518 \u00b1 0.042). (5) Conclusion: This was the pilot study to apply
      GAN to synthesize lumbar spine MR images from CT images and compare training
      algorithms of the GAN. Based on VTT, the axial MR images synthesized from lumbar
      CT using GAN were fairly realistic and the supervised training algorithm was
      found to provide the closest image to true images.", "venue": "Diagnostics",

      (TTM), a sequential, autoregressive Transformer model with memory for real-world
      sequential visual understanding. Our model is inspired by the seminal Neural
      Turing Machine, and has an external memory consisting of a set of tokens which
      summarise the previous history (i.e., frames). This memory is efficiently addressed,
      read and written using a Transformer as the processing unit/controller at each
      step. The model''s memory module ensures that a new observation will only be
      processed with the contents of the memory (and not the entire history), meaning
      that it can efficiently process long sequences with a bounded computational
      cost at each step. We show that TTM outperforms other alternatives, such as
      other Transformer models designed for long sequences and recurrent neural networks,

      "Theory of choreographic languages typically includes a number of complex results
      that are proved by structural induction. The high number of cases and the subtle
      details in some of them lead to long reviewing processes, and occasionally to
      errors being found in published proofs. In this work, we take a published proof
      of Turing completeness of a choreographic language and formalise it in Coq.
      Our development includes formalising the choreographic language and its basic
      properties, Kleene''s theory of partial recursive functions, the encoding of
      these functions as choreographies, and proving this encoding correct. \nWith
      this effort, we show that theorem proving can be a very useful tool in the field
      of choreographic languages: besides the added degree of confidence that we get
      from a mechanised proof, the formalisation process led us to a significant simplification
      of the underlying theory. Our results offer a foundation for the future formal

      "Turing patterns have morphed from mathematical curiosities into highly desirable
      targets for synthetic biology. For a long time, their biological significance
      was sometimes disputed but there is now ample evidence for their involvement
      in processes ranging from skin pigmentation to digit and limb formation. While
      their role in developmental biology is now firmly established, their synthetic
      design has so far proved challenging. Here, we review recent large-scale mathematical
      analyses that have attempted to narrow down potential design principles. We
      consider different aspects of robustness of these models and outline why this
      perspective will be helpful in the search for synthetic Turing-patterning systems.
      We conclude by considering robustness in the context of developmental modelling

      adaptive version of this algorithm in time that accounts for the peculiar dynamics

      the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost for a selection

      "title": "Approximate localised dihedral patterns near a turing instability",
      "abstract": "Fully localised patterns involving cellular hexagons or squares
      have been found experimentally and numerically in various continuum models.
      However, there is currently no mathematical theory for the emergence of these
      localised cellular patterns from a quiescent state. A key issue is that standard
      techniques for one-dimensional patterns have proven insufficient for understanding
      localisation in higher dimensions. In this work, we present a comprehensive
      approach to this problem by using techniques developed in the study of radially-symmetric
      patterns. Our analysis covers localised planar patterns equipped with a wide
      range of dihedral symmetries, thereby avoiding a restriction to solutions on
      a predetermined lattice. The context in this paper is a theory for the emergence
      of such patterns near a Turing instability for a general class of planar reaction-diffusion
      equations. Posing the reaction-diffusion system in polar coordinates, we carry
      out a finite-mode Fourier decomposition in the angular variable to yield a large
      system of coupled radial ordinary differential equations. We then utilise various
      radial spatial dynamics methods, such as invariant manifolds, rescaling charts,
      and normal form analysis, leading to an algebraic matching condition for localised
      patterns to exist in the finite-mode reduction. This algebraic matching condition
      is nontrivial, which we solve via a combination of by-hand calculations and
      Gr\u00f6bner bases from polynomial algebra to reveal the existence of a plethora
      of localised dihedral patterns. These results capture the essence of the emergent
      localised hexagonal patterns witnessed in experiments. Moreover, we combine
      computer-assisted analysis and a Newton\u2013Kantorovich procedure to prove
      the existence of localised patches with 6\u2009m-fold symmetry for arbitrarily
      large Fourier decompositions. This includes the localised hexagon patches that
      have been elusive to analytical treatment.", "venue": "Nonlinearity", "year":

      "title": "Can machines think? The controversy that led to the Turing test",
      "abstract": "Turing\u2019s much debated test has turned 70 and is still fairly
      controversial. His 1950 paper is seen as a complex and multilayered text, and
      key questions about it remain largely unanswered. Why did Turing select learning
      from experience as the best approach to achieve machine intelligence? Why did
      he spend several years working with chess-playing as a task to illustrate and
      test for machine intelligence only to trade it out for conversational question-answering
      in 1950? Why did Turing refer to gender imitation in a test for machine intelligence?
      In this article, I shall address these questions by unveiling social, historical
      and epistemological roots of the so-called Turing test. I will draw attention
      to a historical fact that has been only scarcely observed in the secondary literature
      thus far, namely, that Turing''s 1950 test emerged out of a controversy over
      the cognitive capabilities of digital computers, most notably out of debates
      with physicist and computer pioneer Douglas Hartree, chemist and philosopher
      Michael Polanyi, and neurosurgeon Geoffrey Jefferson. Seen in its historical
      context, Turing\u2019s 1950 paper can be understood as essentially a reply to
      a series of challenges posed to him by these thinkers arguing against his view
      that machines can think. Turing did propose gender learning and imitation as
      one of his various imitation tests for machine intelligence, and I argue here
      that this was done in response to Jefferson''s suggestion that gendered behavior
      is causally related to the physiology of sex hormones.", "venue": "", "year":

      of network structures, and also are the foundations of understanding and controlling
      complex networks. The existing studies (e.g., scale-free model, small-world
      model) are insufficient to uncover the internal mechanisms of the emergence
      and evolution of communities in networks. To overcome the above limitation,
      in consideration of the fact that a network can be regarded as a pattern composed
      of communities, we introduce Turing pattern dynamic as theory support to construct
      the network evolution model. Specifically, we develop a Reaction-Diffusion model
      according to Q-Learning technology (RDQL), in which each node regarded as an
      intelligent agent makes a behavior choice to update its relationships, based
      on the utility and behavioral strategy at every time step. Extensive experiments
      indicate that our model not only reveals how communities form and evolve, but
      also can generate networks with the properties of scale-free, small-world and
      assortativity. The effectiveness of the RDQL model has also been verified by
      its application in real networks. Furthermore, the depth analysis of the RDQL
      model provides a conclusion that the proportion of exploration and exploitation
      behaviors of nodes is the only factor affecting the formation of communities.
      The proposed RDQL model has potential to be the basic theoretical tool for studying

      ideas on biological pattern and the events that led to their wider acceptance
      by biologists as a valid way to investigate developmental pattern, and of the
      value of theory more generally in biology. Periodic patterns have played a key
      role in this process, especially 2D arrays of oriented stripes, which proved
      a disappointment in theoretical terms in the case of Drosophila segmentation,
      but a boost to theory as applied to skin patterns in fish and model chemical
      reactions. The concept of \u201corder from fluctuations\u201d is a key component
      of Turing\u2019s theory, wherein pattern arises by selective amplification of
      spatial components concealed in the random disorder of molecular and/or cellular
      processes. For biological examples, a crucial point from an analytical standpoint
      is knowing the nature of the fluctuations, where the amplifier resides, and
      the timescale over which selective amplification occurs. The answer clarifies
      the difference between \u201cinelegant\u201d examples such as Drosophila segmentation,
      which is perhaps better understood as a programmatic assembly process, and \u201celegant\u201d
      ones expressible in equations like Turing\u2019s: that the fluctuations and
      selection process occur predominantly in evolutionary time for the former, but
      in real time for the latter, and likewise for error suppression, which for Drosophila
      is historical, in being lodged firmly in past evolutionary events. The prospects
      for a further extension of Turing\u2019s ideas to the complexities of brain
      development and consciousness is discussed, where a case can be made that it
      could well be in neuroscience that his ideas find their most important application.",

      "Consider a \ufb01nite sample from an unknown distribution over a countable
      alphabet. The occupancy probability (OP) refers to the total probability of
      symbols that appear exactly k times in the sample. Estimating the OP is a basic
      problem in large alphabet modeling, with a variety of applications in machine
      learning, statistics and information theory. The Good-Turing (GT) framework
      is perhaps the most popular OP estimation scheme. Classical results show that
      the GT estimator converges to the OP, for every k independently. In this work
      we introduce new exact convergence guarantees for the GT estimator, based on
      worst-case mean squared error analysis. Our scheme improves upon currently known
      results. Further, we introduce a novel simultaneous convergence rate, for any
      desired set of occupancy probabilities. This allows us to quantify the uni\ufb01ed
      performance of OP estimators, and introduce a novel estimation framework with
      favorable convergence guarantees.", "venue": "Journal of machine learning research",

      "abstract": "Model invalidation is a good thing. It means that we are forced
      to reconsider either model structures or the available data more closely, that
      is to challenge our fundamental understanding of the problem at hand. It is
      not easy, however, to decide when a model should be invalidated, when we expect
      that the sources of uncertainty in environmental modelling will often be epistemic
      rather than simply aleatory in nature. In particular, epistemic errors in model
      inputs may well exert a very strong control over how accurate we might expect
      model predictions to be when compared against evaluation data that might also
      be subject to epistemic uncertainties. We suggest that both modellers and referees
      should treat model validation as a form of Turing\u2010like Test, whilst being
      more explicit about how the uncertainties in observed data and their impacts
      are assessed. Eight principles in formulating such tests are presented. Being
      explicit about the decisions made in framing an analysis is one important way
      to facilitate communication with users of model outputs, especially when it
      is intended to use a model simulator as a \u2018model of everywhere\u2019 or

      effect of memorability on the outbreak. But the dynamic mechanism remains to
      be illustrated in the fractional-order epidemic system with a network. In this
      paper, Turing instability induced by the network and the memorability of the
      epidemic are investigated in a fractional-order epidemic model. A method is
      proposed to analyze the stability of the fractional-order model with a network
      through the Laplace transform. Meanwhile, the conditions of Turing instability
      and Hopf bifurcation are obtained to discuss the role of fractional order in
      the pattern selection and the Hopf bifurcation point. These results prove the
      fractional-order epidemic model may describe dynamical behavior more accurately
      than the integer epidemic model, which provides the bridge between Turing instability
      and the outbreak of infectious diseases. Also, the early warning area is discussed,
      which can be treated as a controlled area to avoid the spread of infectious
      diseases. Finally, the numerical simulation of the fractional-order system verifies
      the academic results is qualitatively consistent with the instances of COVID-19.",

      "title": "Effects of anisotropic diffusion on Turing patterns in heterogeneous
      environment", "abstract": "Diffusion plays a crucial role in the formation and
      evolution of Turing patterns. Generally, the diffusion processes in complex
      systems do not meet the complete random walk theory, which means the diffusion
      is abnormal rather than normal, such as super-diffusion, sub-diffusion and anisotropic
      diffusion. However, most of previous studies are concentrated on the pattern
      formation mechanism under the normal diffusion. In this paper, a two-component
      reaction-diffusion model with anisotropic diffusion was employed to study the
      effect of anisotropic diffusion on Turing patterns in heterogeneous environments.
      Three different types of anisotropic diffusions have been utilized. It is shown
      that the system gives rise to stripe patterns when the degree of anisotropic
      diffusion is high. The direction of stripes is determined by the deviation degree
      of the diffusion coefficient away from the bifurcation point. With a low degree
      of anisotropic diffusion, the pattern type is the same as than in the isotropic
      diffusion. When the diffusion coefficient grows linearly in the space, different
      types of patterns compete with each other and survive in different regions under
      the influence of spatial heterogeneity. When the diffusion coefficient is modulated
      by a one-dimensional periodic function, both type and wavelength of the pattern
      are determined by the modulated wavelength and the intrinsic wavelength. The
      system can exhibit alternating two-scale mixed patterns of different types when
      the modulated wavelength is larger than the intrinsic wavelength. Note that
      the diffusion coefficient of some special anisotropic media is a tensor, which
      can be expressed as a matrix in two-dimensional cases, we also studied the influence
      of off-diagonal diffusion coefficient D on Turing patterns. It is found that
      the Turing pattern induced by off-diagonal diffusion coefficient always selects
      the oblique stripe pattern. The off-diagonal diffusion coefficient D not only
      affects the pattern selection mechanism, but also expands the parameter range
      of Turing space. The critical diffusion coefficient Dc increases linearly with
      the diagonal diffusion coefficient Du. The intrinsic wavelength of the oblique
      stripe pattern decreases as the off-diagonal diffusion coefficient D increases.
      It is interesting to note that the critical wavelength corresponding to the
      critical diffusion coefficient Dc is independent of the diagonal diffusion coefficient
      Du. These results not only provide a new insight into the formation mechanism
      of Turing patterns, but also increase the range and complexity of possible patterns.",

      computation is the formal description of a finite state machine, the Universal
      Turing Machine, based on manipulation of integers and logic symbols. In this
      contribution to the discourse on the computer-brain analogy, we discuss the
      extent to which analog computing, as performed by the mammalian brain, is like
      and unlike the digital computing of Universal Turing Machines. We begin with
      ordinary reality being a permanent dialog between continuous and discontinuous
      worlds. So it is with computing, which can be analog or digital, and is often
      mixed. The theory behind computers is essentially digital, but efficient simulations
      of phenomena can be performed by analog devices; indeed, any physical calculation
      requires implementation in the physical world and is therefore analog to some
      extent, despite being based on abstract logic and arithmetic. The mammalian
      brain, comprised of neuronal networks, functions as an analog device and has
      given rise to artificial neural networks that are implemented as digital algorithms
      but function as analog models would. Analog constructs compute with the implementation
      of a variety of feedback and feedforward loops. In contrast, digital algorithms
      allow the implementation of recursive processes that enable them to generate
      unparalleled emergent properties. We briefly illustrate how the cortical organization
      of neurons can integrate signals and make predictions analogically. While we
      conclude that brains are not digital computers, we speculate on the recent implementation
      of human writing in the brain as a possible digital path that slowly evolves
      the brain into a genuine (slow) Turing machine.", "venue": "Frontiers in Ecology

      a Turing bifurcation in the Swift-Hohenberg equation using a novel approach
      based on geometric blow-up. We show that the formally derived multiple scales
      ansatz which is known from classical modulation theory can be adapted for use
      in the fast-slow setting, by reformulating it as a blow-up transformation. This
      leads to dynamically simpler modulation equations posed in the blown-up space,
      via a formal procedure which directly extends the established approach to the
      time-dependent setting. The modulation equations take the form of non-autonomous
      Ginzburg-Landau equations, which can be analysed within the blow-up. The asymptotics
      of solutions in weighted Sobelev spaces are given in two different cases: (i)
      A symmetric case featuring a delayed loss of stability, and (ii) A second case
      in which the symmetry is broken by a source term. In order to characterise the
      dynamics of the Swift-Hohenberg equation itself we derive rigorous estimates
      on the error of the dynamic modulation approximation. These estimates are obtained
      by bounding weak solutions to an evolution equation for the error which is also
      posed in the blown-up space. Using the error estimates obtained, we are able
      to infer the asymptotics of a large class of solutions to the dynamic Swift-Hohenberg
      equation. We provide rigorous asymptotics for solutions in both cases (i) and

      study how Turing pattern formation on a growing domain is affected by discrete
      domain discontinuities. We use the Lengyel-Epstein reaction-diffusion model
      to numerically simulate Turing pattern formation on radially expanding circular
      domains containing a variety of obstruction geometries, including obstructions
      spanning the length of the domain, such as walls and slits, and local obstructions,
      such as small blocks. The pattern formation is significantly affected by the
      obstructions, leading to novel pattern morphologies. We show that obstructions
      can induce growth mode switching and disrupt local pattern formation and that
      these effects depend on the shape and placement of the objects as well as the
      domain growth rate. This work provides a customizable framework to perform numerical
      simulations on different types of obstructions and other heterogeneous domains,
      which may guide future numerical and experimental studies. These results may

      "It is becoming increasingly popular for distributed systems to exploit offload
      to reduce load on the CPU. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) offload, in particular,
      has become popular. However, RDMA still requires CPU intervention for complex
      offloads that go beyond simple remote memory access. As such, the offload potential
      is limited and RDMA-based systems usually have to work around such limitations.
      We present RedN, a principled, practical approach to implementing complex RDMA
      offloads, without requiring any hardware modifications. Using self-modifying
      RDMA chains, we lift the existing RDMA verbs interface to a Turing complete
      set of programming abstractions. We explore what is possible in terms of offload
      complexity and performance with a commodity RDMA NIC. We show how to integrate
      these RDMA chains into applications, such as the Memcached key-value store,
      allowing us to offload complex tasks such as key lookups. RedN can reduce the
      latency of key-value get operations by up to 2.6x compared to state-of-the-art
      KV designs that use one-sided RDMA primitives (e.g., FaRM-KV), as well as traditional
      RPC-over-RDMA approaches. Moreover, compared to these baselines, RedN provides
      performance isolation and, in the presence of contention, can reduce latency
      by up to 35x while providing applications with failure resiliency to OS and

      "title": "Studies of Turing pattern formation in zebrafish skin", "abstract":
      "Skin patterns are the first example of the existence of Turing patterns in
      living organisms. Extensive research on zebrafish, a model organism with stripes
      on its skin, has revealed the principles of pattern formation at the molecular
      and cellular levels. Surprisingly, although the networks of cell\u2013cell interactions
      have been observed to satisfy the \u2018short-range activation and long-range
      inhibition\u2019 prerequisites for Turing pattern formation, numerous individual
      reactions were not envisioned based on the classical reaction\u2013diffusion
      model. For example, in real skin, it is not an alteration in concentrations
      of chemicals, but autonomous migration and proliferation of pigment cells that
      establish patterns, and cell\u2013cell interactions are mediated via direct
      contact through cell protrusions. Therefore, the classical reaction\u2013diffusion
      mechanism cannot be used as it is for modelling skin pattern formation. Various
      studies are underway to adapt mathematical models to the experimental findings
      on research into skin patterns, and the purpose of this review is to organize
      and present them. These novel theoretical methods could be applied to autonomous
      pattern formation phenomena other than skin patterns. This article is part of

      "Turing patterns, arising from the interplay between competing species of diffusive

      and biological systems. Historically, these patterns have been studied in extended
      systems and lattices. Recently, the Turing instability was found to produce
      topological patterns in networks with scale-free degree distributions and the
      small world property, although with an apparent absence of geometric organization.
      While hints of explicitly geometric patterns in simple network models (e.g Watts-Strogatz)
      have been found, the question of the exact nature and morphology of geometric
      Turing patterns in heterogeneous complex networks remains unresolved. In this
      work, we study the Turing instability in the framework of geometric random graph
      models, where the network topology is explained by an underlying geometric space.
      We demonstrate that not only can geometric patterns be observed, their wavelength
      can also be estimated by studying the eigenvectors of the annealed graph Laplacian.
      Finally, we show that Turing patterns can be found in geometric embeddings of
      real networks. These results indicate that there is a profound connection between
      the function of a network and its hidden geometry, even when the associated
      dynamical processes are exclusively determined by the network topology.", "venue":

      Turing\u2019s 1950 \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence\u201d and the
      current considerable public exposure to the term \u201cartificial intelligence
      (AI)\u201d, Turing\u2019s question \u201cCan a machine think?\u201d has become
      a topic of daily debate in the media, the home, and, indeed, the pub. However,
      \u201cCan a machine think?\u201d is sliding towards a more controversial issue:
      \u201cCan a machine be conscious?\u201d Of course, the two issues are linked.
      It is held here that consciousness is a pre-requisite to thought. In Turing\u2019s
      imitation game, a conscious human player is replaced by a machine, which, in
      the first place, is assumed not to be conscious, and which may fool an interlocutor,
      as consciousness cannot be perceived from an individual\u2019s speech or action.
      Here, the developing paradigm of machine consciousness is examined and combined
      with an extant analysis of living consciousness to argue that a conscious machine
      is feasible, and capable of thinking. The route to this utilizes learning in
      a \u201cneural state machine\u201d, which brings into play Turing\u2019s view
      of neural \u201cunorganized\u201d machines. The conclusion is that a machine
      of the \u201cunorganized\u201d kind could have an artificial form of consciousness
      that resembles the natural form and that throws some light on its nature.",

      systems", "abstract": "Motivated by bacterial chemotaxis and multi-species ecological
      interactions in heterogeneous environments, we study a general one-dimensional
      reaction-cross-diffusion system in the presence of spatial heterogeneity in
      both transport and reaction terms. Under a suitable asymptotic assumption that
      the transport is slow over the domain, while gradients in the reaction heterogeneity
      are not too sharp, we study the stability of a heterogeneous steady state approximated
      by the system in the absence of transport. Using a WKB ansatz, we find that
      this steady state can undergo a Turing-type instability in subsets of the domain,
      leading to the formation of localized patterns. The boundaries of the pattern-forming
      regions are given asymptotically by `local'' Turing conditions corresponding
      to a spatially homogeneous analysis parameterized by the spatial variable. We
      developed a general open-source code which is freely available, and show numerical
      examples of this localized pattern formation in a Schnakenberg cross-diffusion
      system, a Keller-Segel chemotaxis model, and the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto
      model with heterogeneous parameters. We numerically show that the patterns may
      undergo secondary instabilities leading to spatiotemporal movement of spikes,
      though these remain approximately within the asymptotically predicted localized
      regions. This theory can elegantly differentiate between spatial structure due
      to background heterogeneity, from spatial patterns emergent from Turing-type

      analysis for being a \u201cprecise and unquestionably adequate definition\u201d
      of formal system or mechanical computability, G\u00f6del nevertheless published
      a short note in 1972 claiming to have found a \u201cphilosophical error\u201d
      in Turing\u2019s argument with regard to the finite nature of mental states
      and memory. A natural question arises: how could G\u00f6del enjoy the generality
      conferred on his results by Turing\u2019s work, despite the error of its ways?
      Previous interpretative strategies by Feferman, Shagrir and others have mainly
      tried to resolve the disparity by distinguishing different types of arguments
      in Turing and taking G\u00f6del to approve only some of them. By a more integral
      examination of their ideas, especially Turing\u2019s response to the \u201cmathematical
      objection\u201d based on G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem and G\u00f6del\u2019s
      own conception of finite yet non-mechanical procedures, and taking some of the
      main ideas of current developments in machine learning into consideration, I
      will try to present a new explanation for the apparent disparity, arguing that
      there is no \u201cerror\u201d on Turing\u2019s side and the seemingly conflicting
      views held by Turing and G\u00f6del should best be seen as complementary, keeping

      self-sustained activities in a robust and temporally precise manner. We propose
      a Turing-complete paradigm for neural computation based on synfire rings. More
      specifically, we provide an algorithmic procedure which, for any fixed-space
      Turing machine, builds a corresponding Boolean neural network composed of synfire
      rings capable of simulating it. As a consequence, any fixed-space Turing machine
      with tapes of length $N$ can be simulated in linear time by some Boolean neural
      network composed of O(N) rings and cells. The construction can naturally be
      extended to general Turing machines. Therefore, any Turing machine can be simulated
      in linear time by some Boolean neural network composed of infinitely many synfire
      rings. The linear time simulation relies on the possibility to mimic the behavior
      of the machines. In the long term, these results might contribute to the realization

      operations equivalent to this machine and then applying different interpretations
      of the Shannon measure of information on this series of computational arithmetic
      logical operations may be defined the measure of computer uncertainty or improbability.
      The indecision in the halting problem of the Turing machine because of computational
      uncertainty that is expressed as lack of information to determine how computing
      will develop. Based on these facts 3 it can be shown that there is a local computational
      determinism that is determined by immediate computing conditions, but there
      is a global indeterminism over the entire series of computational operations
      jointed. This also leads us to a different explanation of Turing''s oracle machine
      as such that it introduces external information into the computational performance
      to control computational uncertainty and thus decide the outcome of the computation.
      The Shannon''s interpretations for the measure of the information show that
      indecision over the halting conditions of a Turing machine through an algorithm

      We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated NTT on a navigation task in
      a complex 3D environment. We investigate six classification models to shed light
      on the types of architectures best suited to this task, and validate them against
      data collected through a human NTT. Our best models achieve high accuracy when
      distinguishing true human and agent behavior. At the same time, we show that

      by interfacial polymerization is of great importance in dictating the separation
      performance. Herein, polyamide membranes with a specific nanoscale striped Turing
      structure are generated through facile addition of Zr-based metal-organic framework
      UiO-66-NH2 in the aqueous triethylenetetramine phase. Interestingly, accompanied
      by the degradation of UiO-66-NH2 in aqueous solution, an intermediate complex
      is in situ formed through the strong interaction between the Zr metal center
      and the amine group from triethylenetetramine, which can lower amine diffusion
      and induce a local interfacial reaction, contributing to the generation of a
      homogeneous nanoscale striped Turing structure. The resulting membranes are
      used for CO2/CH4 gas separation. Compared with the parent polyamide membrane
      displaying a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 43.1 and a CO2 permeance of 31.5 GPU, the
      membrane with 0.02 wt % of UiO-66-NH2 introduced into the aqueous phase shows
      a higher CO2/CH4 selectivity of 58.3, along with a CO2 permeance of 27.1 GPU.
      Additionally, when 0.1 wt % of UiO-66-NH2 is incorporated into the aqueous phase,
      the membrane exhibits a combination of a higher CO2/CH4 selectivity and an enhanced
      CO2 permeance in contrast with the parent polyamide membrane.", "venue": "ACS

      is to address the relation between the pattern formation and dynamic transition
      results left open in those papers. We consider the problem in the setting of
      a 2D rectangular box where an instability of the homogeneous steady state occurs
      due to the perturbations in the direction of several modes becoming critical
      simultaneously. Our main results are twofold: (1) a rigorous characterization
      of the types and structure of the dynamic transitions of the model from basic
      homogeneous states and (2) the relation between the dynamic transitions and
      the pattern formations. We observe that the Brusselator model exhibits different
      transition types and patterns depending on the nonlinear interactions of the
      pattern of the critical modes.", "venue": "Mathematical methods in the applied

      made intriguing statements about the future of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI)
      in society. He predicted that machines would eventually \u2018compete with men
      in all purely intellectual \ufb01elds,\u2019 and added that at some stage they
      could be expected \u2018to take control.\u2019 Turing has been associated by
      his biographer, Andrew Hodges, with Dr. Frankenstein from Mary Shelley\u2019s
      dystopian novel. However, he has also been described by his contemporary Geoffrey
      Jefferson as a \u2018scienti\ufb01c\u2019 Percy B. Shelley, the English Romantic
      poet who was posthumously championed as a utopian and radical thinker. This
      article then asks: in what way did Turing envision a society permeated with
      intelligent machines? Did he see it as a utopia or a dystopia? These questions
      are thoroughly examined using Turing\u2019s own texts and related sources. This
      study reconstructs Turing\u2019s historical context in postwar England and analyzes
      his irony and sense of humor, as well as the in\ufb02uence of Samuel Butler
      on his vision. Contrary to recent views in AI science and \ufb01ction, on the
      one hand, a mismatch is shown between Turing and the incautious Frankenstein;
      on the other hand, Turing\u2019s radical Shelley-like qualities are substantiated.
      The article shows that Turing\u2019s utopianism entrusted intelligent machines
      with the task of teaching lessons of rationality and intellectual integrity
      over our place in nature and prejudices. Further, Turing\u2019s irony is shown
      to have targeted intellectuals who sacri\ufb01ce independent thinking to retain
      their power. These, he hoped, would be eventually rivaled and surpassed by intelligent
      machines.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 58, "citationCount":

      quantum computer", "abstract": "It is argued that underlying the Church\u2013Turing
      hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is
      presented explicitly as a physical principle: \u2018every finitely realizible
      physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine
      operating by finite means\u2019. Classical physics and the universal Turing
      machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey
      the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing
      machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines
      is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the ''universal quantum
      computer\u2019 are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling
      the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have
      many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do
      not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include
      \u2018quantum parallelism\u2019, a method by which certain probabilistic tasks
      can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical
      restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable
      strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett\u2019s. Some
      of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the
      rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically
      more reasonable definition of the \u2018complexity\u2019 or \u2018knowledge\u2019
      in a physical system than does classical complexity theory.", "venue": "Proceedings

      "title": "Modern perspectives on near-equilibrium analysis of Turing systems",
      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      "abstract": "Turing structures at the nanoscale Turing structures arise when
      imbalances in diffusion rates make a stable steady-state system sensitive to
      small heterogeneous perturbations. For example, Turing patterns occur in chemical
      reactions when a fast-moving inhibitor controls the motion of a slower-moving
      activator. Tan et al. grew polyamide membranes by using interfacial polymerization,
      where the reactions occur at the interface between oil and water layers. The
      addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the aqueous phase reduced the diffusion of
      the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands,
      which prove to be better for water desalination. Science, this issue p. 518
      Turing structures generated via diffusion-driven instabilities make polyamide
      membranes for water desalination. The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental
      importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications
      have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based
      on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for
      water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions
      enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes
      exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound
      line of traditional desalination membranes. Furthermore, we show the existence
      of high water permeability sites in the Turing structures, where water transport
      through the membranes is enhanced.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

      the field of natural language generation relied upon formalized grammar systems,

      salad poems or chat with humans within narrowly defined topics. Recently, very
      large-scale statistical language models have dramatically advanced the field,
      and GPT-3 is just one example. It can internalize the rules of language without
      explicit programming or rules. Instead, much like a human child, GPT-3 learns
      language through repeated exposure, albeit on a much larger scale. Without explicit

      "abstract": "Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for
      unstructured domains is a challenging problem. Unfortunately, existing automatic
      evaluation metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements
      of response quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation
      procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and
      testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to
      this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning problem.We
      present an evaluation model (ADEM)that learns to predict human-like scores to
      input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores. We show that

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "title": "Dissecting the NVidia Turing T4 GPU via Microbenchmarking", "abstract":
      "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs, coupled
      with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a hurdle
      for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
      Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
      using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s
      latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine
      Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations.
      Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications.
      We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the
      P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
      higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study
      the performance of the T4''s TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on
      low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces
      new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s
      instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions.
      We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as
      the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large
      as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4
      memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over
      its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
      workloads that hit power or thermal limits. \nMany of our findings are novel,
      published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software
      developers get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "Stochastic Turing patterns in a synthetic bacterial population", "abstract":
      "Significance In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could
      arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing
      inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing\u2019s conditions are disappointingly
      hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts
      pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered
      bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor
      system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered
      patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively
      with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms,
      driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much
      broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin of biological
      morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our
      understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952,
      Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability
      of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion
      systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing
      activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and
      the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called
      into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator\u2013inhibitor
      birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts
      the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with
      no severe requirement on the ratio of activator\u2013inhibitor diffusion coefficients.
      To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically
      engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules
      form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming
      gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered
      bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale
      much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental
      patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These
      results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity,
      can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings
      provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising
      from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.",

      turing test for lung cancer diagnosis", "abstract": "Discriminating lung nodules
      as malignant or benign is still an underlying challenge. To address this challenge,
      radiologists need computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can assist in
      learning discriminative imaging features corresponding to malignant and benign
      nodules. However, learning highly discriminative imaging features is an open
      problem. In this paper, our aim is to learn the most discriminative features
      pertaining to lung nodules by using an adversarial learning methodology. Specifically,
      we propose to use un-supervised learning with Deep Convolutional-Generative
      Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) to generate lung nodule samples realistically.
      We hypothesize that imaging features of lung nodules will be discriminative
      if it is hard to differentiate them (fake) from real (true) nodules. To test
      this hypothesis, we present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order
      to evaluate the quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons
      are performed in discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules.
      This experimental set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated
      nodules, which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining
      highly discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational
      purposes, and (3) generate realistic samples to train deep networks with big
      data.", "venue": "IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging", "year":

      but less is known concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous
      media. It is non-trivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent
      spatial heterogeneity from emergent patterning due to nonlinear instability.
      We employ WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
      which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions. We find that the
      structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical trigonometric
      functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of different growth
      rates are localized to different spatial regions. This localization helps explain
      common amplitude modulations observed in simulations of Turing systems in heterogeneous
      settings. We numerically demonstrate this theory, giving an illustrative example
      of the emergent instabilities and the striking complexity arising from spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion systems. Our results give insight both
      into systems driven by exogenous heterogeneity, as well as successive pattern
      forming processes, noting that most scenarios in biology do not involve symmetry
      breaking from homogeneity, but instead consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous
      states. The instability mechanism reported here precisely captures such evolution,

      Spiking neural P systems with communication on request (SNQ P systems) are a
      type of spiking neural P system where the spikes are requested from neighboring
      neurons. SNQ P systems have previously been proved to be universal (computationally

      paper studies a simplified version of SNQ P systems, i.e. SNQ P systems with
      one type of spike. It is proved that one type of spike is enough to guarantee
      the Turing universality of SNQ P systems. Theoretical results are shown in the
      cases of the SNQ P system used in both generating and accepting modes. Furthermore,
      the influence of the number of unbounded neurons (the number of spikes in a
      neuron is not bounded) on the computation power of SNQ P systems with one type
      of spike is investigated. It is found that SNQ P systems functioning as number

      researchers today believe that each finger forms because of its unique position
      within the early limb bud. However, 30 years ago, developmental biologists proposed
      that the arrangement of fingers followed the Turing pattern, a self-organizing
      process during early embryo development. Raspopovic et al. provide evidence
      to support a Turing mechanism (see the Perspective by Zuniga and Zeller). They
      reveal that Bmp and Wnt signaling pathways, together with the gene Sox9, form
      a Turing network. The authors used this network to generate a computer model
      capable of accurately reproducing the patterns that cells follow as the embryo
      grows fingers. Science, this issue p. 566; see also p. 516 Modeling and experiments
      reveal how limb digits are patterned by three components. [Also see Perspective
      by Zuniga and Zeller] During limb development, digits emerge from the undifferentiated
      mesenchymal tissue that constitutes the limb bud. It has been proposed that
      this process is controlled by a self-organizing Turing mechanism, whereby diffusible
      molecules interact to produce a periodic pattern of digital and interdigital
      fates. However, the identities of the molecules remain unknown. By combining
      experiments and modeling, we reveal evidence that a Turing network implemented
      by Bmp, Sox9, and Wnt drives digit specification. We develop a realistic two-dimensional
      simulation of digit patterning and show that this network, when modulated by
      morphogen gradients, recapitulates the expression patterns of Sox9 in the wild
      type and in perturbation experiments. Our systems biology approach reveals how
      a combination of growth, morphogen gradients, and a self-organizing Turing network
      can achieve robust and reproducible pattern formation.", "venue": "Science",

      In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods
      of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations
      measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according
      to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding.
      We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares
      a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to
      probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition
      to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy
      in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated
      by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a
      story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted
      device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given
      test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides
      the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes
      the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered
      to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s
      answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question.
      Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural
      language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned
      from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the
      answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,
      is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test
      is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions
      that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object,
      through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other
      uniquely instantiated objects.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy

      Vertebrates have a vast array of epithelial appendages, including scales, feathers,

      explained by Alan Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion system. However, the role

      (compared to tetrapods), such as the cartilaginous fishes, is poorly understood.
      We investigate patterning of the unique tooth-like skin denticles of sharks,

      through simulation models that a Turing-like mechanism can explain shark denticle
      patterning and verify this system using gene expression analysis and gene pathway
      inhibition experiments. This mechanism bears remarkable similarity to avian
      feather patterning, suggesting deep homology of the system. We propose that

      "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during
      embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular
      mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that
      tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of
      chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously
      arising from specific chemical interactions (such as \u201cTuring-patterns\u201d).
      Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products
      of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories,
      and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively
      influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus
      on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development.
      On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical
      simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of
      the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical
      behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied
      using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis
      to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development.
      On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even
      simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead
      to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that
      the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories
      are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning

      "What can artificial intelligence teach us about the mind? If AI''s underlying
      concept is that thinking is a computational process, then how can computation
      illuminate thinking? It''s a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the buzziest
      AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer systems that learn intelligent
      behavior from massive amounts of data. This is what powers a driverless car,
      for example. In this book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to \"good
      old fashioned artificial intelligence,\" which is based not on heaps of data
      but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind of artificial intelligence
      is equipped to handle situations that depart from previous patterns -- as we
      do in real life, when, for example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when
      the barista informs us there''s no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
      of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that passes the famous
      Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he proposes another way to test
      for intelligence -- the Winograd Schema Test, developed by Levesque and his
      colleagues. \"If our goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we had better
      understand the difference between making it and faking it,\" he observes. He
      identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the capacity to call
      on background knowledge: the ability to represent objects of thought symbolically.
      As AI migrates more and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems
      without common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.", "venue":

      model explains how identical cells can self-organize to form spatial patterns.
      It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different
      diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous
      signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical
      analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals
      that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern
      with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients.
      We provide a software (available at http://www.RDNets.com) to explore these
      networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental
      data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control
      embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how
      existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form
      Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework
      to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use

      "title": "An improved nonparametric lower bound of species richness via a modified
      good\u2013turing frequency formula", "abstract": "It is difficult to accurately
      estimate species richness if there are many almost undetectable species in a
      hyper\u2010diverse community. Practically, an accurate lower bound for species
      richness is preferable to an inaccurate point estimator. The traditional nonparametric
      lower bound developed by Chao (1984, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11,
      265\u2013270) for individual\u2010based abundance data uses only the information
      on the rarest species (the numbers of singletons and doubletons) to estimate
      the number of undetected species in samples. Applying a modified Good\u2013Turing
      frequency formula, we derive an approximate formula for the first\u2010order
      bias of this traditional lower bound. The approximate bias is estimated by using
      additional information (namely, the numbers of tripletons and quadrupletons).
      This approximate bias can be corrected, and an improved lower bound is thus
      obtained. The proposed lower bound is nonparametric in the sense that it is
      universally valid for any species abundance distribution. A similar type of
      improved lower bound can be derived for incidence data. We test our proposed

      to Alan Turing, reflects on Turing''s personality in order to better understand

      human attitude and particular scientific method, Turing is able to \u201cimmerse
      himself\u201d into the phenomena on which he works. This peculiar blend justifies
      the epistolary style. Turing makes himself a \u201chuman computer\u201d, he
      lives the dramatic quest for an undetectable imitation of a man, a woman, a
      machine. He makes us see the continuous deformations of a material action/reaction/diffusion
      dynamics of hardware with no software. Each of these investigations opens the
      way to new scientific paths with major consequences for contemporary live and
      for knowledge. The uses and the effects of these investigations will be discussed:
      the passage from classical AI to today''s neural nets, the relevance of non-linearity
      in biological dynamics, but also their abuses, such as the myth of a computational
      world, from a Turing-machine like universe to an encoded homunculus in the DNA.

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines", "abstract": "The expressive
      power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential
      computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been
      more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number
      of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing
      Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even greater number
      of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its
      memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM
      can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory is relatively
      easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire memory content
      at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement a fast NTM.
      In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to access the memory,
      while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the memory. We call this
      model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access a constant number of
      memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation can be faster.
      The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn programs of unbounded
      running time. We successfully trained the RL-NTM to solve a number of algorithmic
      tasks that are simpler than the ones solvable by the fully differentiable NTM.
      As the RL-NTM is a fairly intricate model, we needed a method for verifying
      the correctness of our implementation. To do so, we developed a simple technique
      for numerically checking arbitrary implementations of models that use Reinforce,
      which may be of independent interest.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2015,

      models because of its external memory. It can be viewed as a broader effort
      to use abstract external Interfaces and to learn a parametric model that interacts
      with them. \nThe capabilities of a model can be extended by providing it with
      proper Interfaces that interact with the world. These external Interfaces include
      memory, a database, a search engine, or a piece of software such as a theorem
      verifier. Some of these Interfaces are provided by the developers of the model.
      However, many important existing Interfaces, such as databases and search engines,
      are discrete. \nWe examine feasibility of learning models to interact with discrete
      Interfaces. We investigate the following discrete Interfaces: a memory Tape,
      an input Tape, and an output Tape. We use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm
      to train a neural network that interacts with such Interfaces to solve simple

      "abstract": "Significance Turing proposed that intercellular reaction-diffusion
      of molecules is responsible for morphogenesis. The impact of this paradigm has
      been profound. We exploit an abiological experimental system of emulsion drops
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reactants ideally suited to test Turing\u2019s
      theory. Our experiments verify Turing\u2019s thesis of the chemical basis of
      morphogenesis and reveal a pattern, not previously predicted by theory, which
      we explain by extending Turing\u2019s model to include heterogeneity. Quantitative
      experimental results obtained using this artificial cellular system establish
      the strengths and weaknesses of the Turing model, applicable to biology and
      materials science alike, and pinpoint which directions are required for improvement.
      Alan Turing, in \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d [Turing AM (1952)
      Philos Trans R Soc Lond 237(641):37\u201372], described how, in circular arrays
      of identical biological cells, diffusion can interact with chemical reactions
      to generate up to six periodic spatiotemporal chemical structures. Turing proposed
      that one of these structures, a stationary pattern with a chemically determined
      wavelength, is responsible for differentiation. We quantitatively test Turing\u2019s
      ideas in a cellular chemical system consisting of an emulsion of aqueous droplets
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillatory chemical reactants, dispersed
      in oil, and demonstrate that reaction-diffusion processes lead to chemical differentiation,
      which drives physical morphogenesis in chemical cells. We observe five of the
      six structures predicted by Turing. In 2D hexagonal arrays, a seventh structure
      emerges, incompatible with Turing\u2019s original model, which we explain by
      modifying the theory to include heterogeneity.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      "title": "Globally stable microresonator Turing pattern formation for coherent
      high-power THz radiation on-chip", "abstract": "In nonlinear microresonators
      driven by continuous-wave (cw) lasers, Turing patterns have been studied in
      the formalism of Lugiato-Lefever equation with emphasis on its high coherence
      and exceptional robustness against perturbations. Destabilization of Turing
      pattern and transition to spatio-temporal chaos, however, limits the available
      energy carried in the Turing rolls and prevents further harvest of their high
      coherence and robustness to noise. Here we report a novel scheme to circumvent
      such destabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations,
      and attain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear
      oscillators, achieving a record high power conversion efficiency of 45% and
      an elevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern is
      discretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency
      sideband non-uniformity measured at 7.3x10^-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous
      microwave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution stages
      through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free running Turing roll
      coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is transferred onto a
      plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest power THz coherent generation at
      room-temperature, with 1.1% optical-to-THz power conversion. Its long-term stability
      can be further improved by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching an Allan
      deviation of 6x10^-10 at 100 s, with a simple computer-aided slow feedback control.
      The demonstrated on-chip coherent high-power Turing-THz system is promising
      to find applications in astrophysics, medical imaging, and wireless communications.",

      "abstract": "\n \n Penetration testing (pentesting) is a well established method
      for identifying security weaknesses, by conducting friendly attacks. Simulated
      pentesting automates this process, through designing a model of the system at
      hand, and using model-based attack planning to generate the attacks. Classical
      planning variants of this idea are being used commercially by the pentesting
      industry since 2010. Such models can pinpoint potentially dangerous combinations
      of known vulnerabilities, but ignore the incomplete knowledge characteristic
      of hacking from the attacker''s point of view. Yet, ideally, the simulation
      should conduct its attacks the same way a real attacker would. Hence the ultimate
      goal is much more ambitious: to realistically simulate a human hacker. This
      is a grand vision indeed; e.g., the classical Turing Test can be viewed as a
      sub-problem. Taking a more practical perspective, the simulated pentesting model
      space spans a broad range of sequential decision making problems. Analyzing
      prior work in AI and other relevant areas, we derive a systematization of this
      model space, highlighting a multitude of interesting challenges to AI sequential
      decision making research.\n \n", "venue": "International Conference on Automated

      "The formation of ordered structures, in particular Turing patterns, in complex
      spatially extended systems has been observed in many different contexts, spanning
      from natural sciences (chemistry, physics, and biology) to technology (mechanics
      and electronics). In this paper, it is shown that the use of memristors in a
      simple cell of a spatially-extended circuit architecture allows us to design
      systems able to generate Turing patterns. In addition, the memristor parameters
      play a key role in the selection of the type and characteristics of the emerging
      pattern, which is also influenced by the initial conditions. The problem of
      finding the regions of parameters where Turing patterns may emerge in the proposed
      cellular architecture is solved in an analytic way, and numerical results are
      shown to illustrate the system behavior with respect to its parameters.", "venue":

      "title": "Competitive Distribution Estimation: Why is Good-Turing Good", "abstract":
      "Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning
      tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,
      add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly
      in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,
      and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
      \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
      For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following
      two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well
      as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to
      a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the
      best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but
      as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all
      symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
      over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant
      of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
      from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
      1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
      at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
      and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "Neural

      "Alan Turing was neither a biologist nor a chemist, and yet the paper he published
      in 1952, \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019, on the spontaneous
      formation of patterns in systems undergoing reaction and diffusion of their
      ingredients has had a substantial impact on both fields, as well as in other
      areas as disparate as geomorphology and criminology. Motivated by the question
      of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such as
      a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random
      fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial uniformity.
      The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far away from its
      equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial
      ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms, of which Turing''s
      model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason, these patterns show
      striking similarities in systems that seem superficially to share nothing in
      common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation on a zebra skin.
      New examples of \u2018Turing patterns'' in biology and beyond are still being
      discovered today. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary

      the two instability mechanisms, which dictates two completely novel scenarios.
      At low detunings from resonance, switching occurs between the stable stationary
      lower branch and the Faraday-unstable upper branch, whereas at high detunings
      we observe the crossover between the Turing and Faraday periodic structures.

      "title": "Towards a Visual Turing Challenge", "abstract": "As language and visual
      understanding by machines progresses rapidly, we are observing an increasing
      interest in holistic architectures that tightly interlink both modalities in
      a joint learning and inference process. This trend has allowed the community
      to progress towards more challenging and open tasks and refueled the hope at
      achieving the old AI dream of building machines that could pass a turing test
      in open domains. In order to steadily make progress towards this goal, we realize
      that quantifying performance becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore we ask
      how we can precisely define such challenges and how we can evaluate different
      algorithms on this open tasks? In this paper, we summarize and discuss such
      challenges as well as try to give answers where appropriate options are available
      in the literature. We exemplify some of the solutions on a recently presented
      dataset of question-answering task based on real-world indoor images that establishes
      a visual turing challenge. Finally, we argue despite the success of unique ground-truth
      annotation, we likely have to step away from carefully curated dataset and rather
      rely on ''social consensus'' as the main driving force to create suitable benchmarks.
      Providing coverage in this inherently ambiguous output space is an emerging
      challenge that we face in order to make quantifiable progress in this area.",

      "abstract": "Significance Corneal surfaces of some insects are coated with nipple-like
      nanostructures reducing the light reflection. Here we provide an extensive analysis
      of corneae across insect groups. Using atomic force microscopy, we discover
      a striking diversity of corneal nanocoatings, omnipresent in arthropods. These
      fascinating bionanostructures replicate the complete set of the Turing patterns\u2014shapes
      resulting from the reaction\u2212diffusion modeling underlying many examples
      of patterning in biological and physicochemical systems. Our work, verging on
      the interface of nanotechnology and zoology, evolution and biophysics, and ecology
      and genetics, sheds light on the molecular origin and evolutionary diversification
      of a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures. It also describes,
      to our knowledge, the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.
      Nipple-like nanostructures covering the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies,
      and Drosophila have been studied by electron and atomic force microscopy, and
      their antireflective properties have been described. In contrast, corneal nanostructures
      of the majority of other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined
      by methods that did not allow precise morphological characterization. Here we
      provide a comprehensive analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing
      a rich diversity of insect corneal nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are categorized
      into four major morphological patterns and various transitions between them,
      many, to our knowledge, never described before. Remarkably, this unexpectedly
      diverse range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing
      patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled by
      Alan Turing in his famous reaction\u2212diffusion system. These findings reveal
      a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures and shed light on their
      molecular origin and evolutionary diversification. They may also be the first-ever

      and can significantly change the dynamics of these systems. Quite a few works
      have been focused on analyzing the effect of small delays on the pattern formation
      of biological systems. In this paper, we investigate the effect of any delay
      on the formation of Turing patterns of reaction-diffusion equations. First,
      for a delay system in a general form, we propose a technique calculating the
      critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs. Then
      we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern formation
      of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find that when
      the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular patterns,
      which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large delay we find
      spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find that the critical
      delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying capacity to half saturation
      of the prey density.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      "abstract": "We study the computational capabilities of a biologically inspired
      neural model where the synaptic weights, the connectivity pattern, and the number
      of neurons can evolve over time rather than stay static. Our study focuses on
      the mere concept of plasticity of the model so that the nature of the updates
      is assumed to be not constrained. In this context, we show that the so-called
      plastic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of the precise super-Turing
      computational power--as the static analog neural networks--irrespective of whether
      their synaptic weights are modeled by rational or real numbers, and moreover,
      irrespective of whether their patterns of plasticity are restricted to bi-valued
      updates or expressed by any other more general form of updating. Consequently,
      the incorporation of only bi-valued plastic capabilities in a basic model of
      RNNs suffices to break the Turing barrier and achieve the super-Turing level
      of computation. The consideration of more general mechanisms of architectural
      plasticity or of real synaptic weights does not further increase the capabilities
      of the networks. These results support the claim that the general mechanism
      of plasticity is crucially involved in the computational and dynamical capabilities
      of biological neural networks. They further show that the super-Turing level

      the level of praise that has been lavished on Turing is justified. Yes, the
      1936 paper in which he defined what are now known as Turing machines is a landmark
      in the history of science, but other logicians at the time were involved in
      the development of formal models of computation, including Herbrand, G\u00f6del,
      Post, and Church. And, although Turing played an important part in the development
      of the modern electronic computer, his role should not be overstated: a number
      of early computing devices were built from the late 1930\u2019s to mid-1940\u2019s
      with little or no influence of Turing\u2019s early foundational work, and the
      real history involves a complex mix of theoretical and practical insights, with
      contributions from a substantial cast of researchers and engineers alongside
      Turing. Finally, although the hideous abuses that Turing was subjected to as
      a homosexual in postwar Britain are made even more ironic by the role he played
      in helping the allies win the war, those abuses are no more morally offensive
      than those suffered by countless others whose lives are left uncelebrated. With
      all this in mind, it is reasonable to ask: was all the hoopla really called
      for? One need only sit down with Turing\u2019s work for an hour or two, however,
      to find such doubts pushed aside. His papers are full of technical detail, but
      are surprisingly easy to read. His writing is careful and methodical, but even
      after all these years the work feels creatively fresh and original. He dealt
      with weighty topics and raised important questions, but relied on technical
      mastery and a good deal of hard work to back up his answers. When we read",

      of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from
      a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations
      for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges: Alan had proved that there
      was no \"miraculous machine\" that could solve all mathematical problems, but
      in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea
      of a universal machine that could take over the work of any machine. During
      World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret
      British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German''s Enigma machine code
      was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because
      his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security,
      implemented with machines and remorseless logic: \"It was his own invention,
      and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.\" Andrew Hodges''s remarkable
      insight weaves Turing''s mathematical and computer work with his personal life
      to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek
      Jacobi movie Breaking the Code. Hodges has the mathematical knowledge to explain
      the intellectual significance of Turing''s work, while never losing sight of
      the human and social picture: In this sense his life belied his work, for it
      could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life
      raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the
      body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society,
      the individual and history. And Hodges admits what all biographers know, but
      few admit, about their subjects: \"his inner code remains unbroken.\" Alan Turing

      and biological implementations of Turing patterns, yet this is necessary for
      both understanding and engineering these networks with synthetic biology approaches.
      Here, we model a reaction\u2013diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable
      regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology
      study in mammalian cells.1 The model employs a single promoter to express both
      the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large regions
      of parameter space, using biologically interpretable Hill function reactions.
      We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing biologically
      tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of successful patterning.
      We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time evolution by manipulating
      the values for production and degradation relationships. More importantly, our
      analysis predicts that steep dose\u2013response functions arising from cooperativity
      are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness increases parameter space
      and even reduces the requirement for differential diffusion between activator
      and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some of the limitations of linear scenarios
      for reaction\u2013diffusion systems and will help to guide projects to engineer

      "During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing 1912--1954 has been widely
      celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption,
      Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate Turing''s
      motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as
      expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments
      within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In
      particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also
      the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level
      AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine a machine
      which learns like an infant dominates the closing section of the paper, in which
      he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three
      alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: 1 AI by programming,
      2 AI by ab initio machine learning and 3 AI using logic, probabilities, learning
      and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in
      the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We
      compare Turing''s three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude
      with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper.",

      system to describe species anomalous superdiffusion. The effects of the superdiffusive
      exponent on pattern formation and pattern selection are studied. Our linear
      stability analysis shows that the wave number of the Turing pattern increases
      with the superdiffusive exponent. A weakly nonlinear analysis yields a system
      of amplitude equations and the analysis of these amplitude equations predicts
      parameter regimes where hexagons, stripes, and their coexistence are expected.
      Numerical simulations of the activator-inhibitor model near the stability boundaries
      confirm our analytical results. Since diffusion rate manifests in both diffusion
      constant and diffusion exponent, we numerically explore their interactions on
      the emergence of Turing patterns. When the activator and inhibitor have different
      superdiffusive exponents, we find that the critical ratio of the diffusion rate
      of the inhibitor to the activator, required for the formation of the Turing
      pattern, increases monotonically with the superdiffusive exponent. We conclude
      that small ratio (than unity) of anomalous diffusion exponent between the inhibitor
      and activator is more likely to promote the emergence of the Turing pattern,

      Science\u2019", "abstract": "In the popular imagination, the relevance of Turing''s
      theoretical ideas to people producing actual machines was significant and appreciated
      by everybody involved in computing from the moment he published his 1936 paper
      \u2018On Computable Numbers\u2019. Careful historians are aware that this popular
      conception is deeply misleading. We know from previous work by Campbell-Kelly,
      Aspray, Akera, Olley, Priestley, Daylight, Mounier-Kuhn, Haigh, and others that
      several computing pioneers, including Aiken, Eckert, Mauchly, and Zuse, did
      not depend on (let alone were they aware of) Turing''s 1936 universal-machine
      concept. Furthermore, it is not clear whether any substance in von Neumann''s
      celebrated 1945 \u2018First Draft Report on the EDVAC\u2019 is influenced in
      any identifiable way by Turing''s work. This raises the questions: (i) When
      does Turing enter the field? (ii) Why did the Association for Computing Machinery
      (ACM) honor Turing by associating his name to ACM''s most prestigious award,
      the Turing Award? Previous authors have been rather vague about these questions,
      suggesting some date between 1950 and the early 1960s as the point at which
      Turing is retroactively integrated into the foundations of computing and associating
      him in some way with the movement to develop something that people call computer
      science. In this paper, based on detailed examination of hitherto overlooked
      primary sources, attempts are made to reconstruct networks of scholars and ideas
      prevalent in the 1950s, and to identify a specific group of actors interested
      in theorizing about computations in computers and attracted to the idea of language
      as a frame in which to understand computation. By going back to Turing''s 1936
      paper and, more importantly, to re-cast versions of Turing''s work published
      during the 1950s (Rosenbloom, Kleene, Markov), I identify the factors that made
      this group of scholars particularly interested in Turing''s work and provided
      the original vector by which Turing became to be appreciated in retrospect as

      of a Turing-Type Mechanism", "abstract": "Digit Determination Pentadactyly has
      been an early and rapid innovation of tetrapods. Sheth et al. (p. 1476) report
      that a dramatic reduction in distally expressed Hox genes, in the absence of
      a functional morphogen signaling pathway, results in extreme polydactyly in
      mice. Mutant digits exhibited patterns reminiscent of the endoskeleton of fins,
      suggesting that an ancestral patterning mechanism has been deeply conserved
      in evolution. Mouse genetics and computer modeling suggest that a reaction-diffusion
      mechanism defines digit pattern. The formation of repetitive structures (such
      as stripes) in nature is often consistent with a reaction-diffusion mechanism,
      or Turing model, of self-organizing systems. We used mouse genetics to analyze
      how digit patterning (an iterative digit/nondigit pattern) is generated. We
      showed that the progressive reduction in Hoxa13 and Hoxd11-Hoxd13 genes (hereafter
      referred to as distal Hox genes) from the Gli3-null background results in progressively
      more severe polydactyly, displaying thinner and densely packed digits. Combined
      with computer modeling, our results argue for a Turing-type mechanism underlying
      digit patterning, in which the dose of distal Hox genes modulates the digit
      period or wavelength. The phenotypic similarity with fish-fin endoskeleton patterns
      suggests that the pentadactyl state has been achieved through modification of
      an ancestral Turing-type mechanism.", "venue": "Science", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

      "Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy, homogenous
      initial conditions and have been proposed as patterning mechanism for many developmental
      processes. However, the molecular components that give rise to Turing patterns
      have remained elusive, and the small size of the parameter space that permits
      Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to explain how Turing patterns
      could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing patterns can be obtained with
      a single ligand if the ligand-receptor interaction is taken into account. Here
      we show that the general properties of ligand-receptor systems result in very
      large Turing spaces. Thus, the restriction of receptors to single cells, negative
      feedbacks, regulatory interactions among different ligand-receptor systems,
      and the clustering of receptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the
      Turing space. We further show that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10-SHH
      network that controls lung branching morphogenesis are sufficient to result
      in large Turing spaces. We conclude that the cellular restriction of receptors
      provides a mechanism to sufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to
      make the evolution of Turing patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then
      have further enlarged the Turing space. Given their robustness and flexibility,
      we propose that receptor-ligand-based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism
      for patterning in biology.", "venue": "Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear,

      diffusion shows how nonlinear diffusion favors the occurrence of Turing pattern
      formation. We study the process of pattern formation both in one-dimensional
      and two-dimensional spatial domains. Through a weakly nonlinear multiple scales
      analysis we derive the equations for the amplitude of the stationary patterns.
      The analysis of the amplitude equations shows the occurrence of a number of
      different phenomena, including stable supercritical and subcritical Turing patterns
      with multiple branches of stable solutions leading to hysteresis. Moreover,
      we consider traveling patterning waves: When the domain size is large, the pattern
      forms sequentially and traveling wave fronts are the precursors to patterning.
      We derive the Ginzburg-Landau equation and describe the traveling front enveloping
      a pattern which invades the domain. We show the emergence of radially symmetric

      Turing mechanism", "abstract": "The main signalling proteins that control early
      kidney branching have been defined. Yet the underlying mechanism is still elusive.
      We have previously shown that a Schnakenberg-type Turing mechanism can recapitulate
      the branching and protein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant lungs,
      but it is unclear whether this mechanism would extend to other branched organs
      that are regulated by other proteins. Here, we show that the glial cell line-derived
      neurotrophic factor\u2013RET regulatory interaction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type
      Turing model that reproduces the observed budding of the ureteric bud from the
      Wolffian duct, its invasion into the mesenchyme and the observed branching pattern.
      The model also recapitulates all relevant protein expression patterns in wild-type
      and mutant mice. The lung and kidney models are both based on a particular receptor\u2013ligand
      interaction and require (1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2)
      a lower diffusion coefficient for the receptor than for the ligand and (3) an
      increase in the receptor concentration in response to receptor\u2013ligand binding
      (by enhanced transcription, more recycling or similar). These conditions are
      met also by other receptor\u2013ligand systems. We propose that ligand\u2013receptor-based

      Alan Turing''s hundredth birthday, I unwisely set out some thoughts about one
      of Turing''s obsessions throughout his life, the question of physics and free
      will. I focus relatively narrowly on a notion that I call \"Knightian freedom\":
      a certain kind of in-principle physical unpredictability that goes beyond probabilistic
      unpredictability. Other, more metaphysical aspects of free will I regard as
      possibly outside the scope of science. I examine a viewpoint, suggested independently
      by Carl Hoefer, Cristi Stoica, and even Turing himself, that tries to find scope
      for \"freedom\" in the universe''s boundary conditions rather than in the dynamical
      laws. Taking this viewpoint seriously leads to many interesting conceptual problems.
      I investigate how far one can go toward solving those problems, and along the
      way, encounter (among other things) the No-Cloning Theorem, the measurement
      problem, decoherence, chaos, the arrow of time, the holographic principle, Newcomb''s
      paradox, Boltzmann brains, algorithmic information theory, and the Common Prior
      Assumption. I also compare the viewpoint explored here to the more radical speculations
      of Roger Penrose. The result of all this is an unusual perspective on time,
      quantum mechanics, and causation, of which I myself remain skeptical, but which
      has several appealing features. Among other things, it suggests interesting
      empirical questions in neuroscience, physics, and cosmology; and takes a millennia-old
