      Large-Scale Generative Language Model", "abstract": "Pretrained general-purpose
      language models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in various natural language
      processing domains by adapting to downstream tasks via zero-shot, few-shot and
      fine-tuning techniques. Because of their success, the size of these models has
      increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic
      techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort
      between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest
      monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG),
      with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure
      as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed
      and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
      corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
      to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results,
      as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
      We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
      accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results.
      We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale
      training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language
      generations.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 78, "citationCount":

      "abstract": "Abstract In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a test of whether a machine
      was intelligent: could a machine imitate a human so well that its answers to
      questions were indistinguishable from a human''s? Ever since, creating intelligence
      that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of
      thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like
      artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure,
      and perhaps most profoundly a better understanding of our own minds. But not
      all types of AI are human-like-in fact, many of the most powerful systems are
      very different from humans-and an excessive focus on developing and deploying
      HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human
      labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly
      dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused
      on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, humans retain the power to
      insist on a share of the value created. What is more, augmentation creates new
      capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value
      than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial,
      there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation
      among technologists, business executives, and policy-makers.", "venue": "Daedalus",

      "title": "Large Language Models and the Reverse Turing Test", "abstract": "Abstract
      Large language models (LLMs) have been transformative. They are pretrained foundational
      models that are self-supervised and can be adapted with fine-tuning to a wide
      range of natural language tasks, each of which previously would have required
      a separate network model. This is one step closer to the extraordinary versatility
      of human language. GPT-3 and, more recently, LaMDA, both of them LLMs, can carry
      on dialogs with humans on many topics after minimal priming with a few examples.
      However, there has been a wide range of reactions and debate on whether these
      LLMs understand what they are saying or exhibit signs of intelligence. This
      high variance is exhibited in three interviews with LLMs reaching wildly different
      conclusions. A new possibility was uncovered that could explain this divergence.
      What appears to be intelligence in LLMs may in fact be a mirror that reflects
      the intelligence of the interviewer, a remarkable twist that could be considered
      a reverse Turing test. If so, then by studying interviews, we may be learning
      more about the intelligence and beliefs of the interviewer than the intelligence
      of the LLMs. As LLMs become more capable, they may transform the way we interact
      with machines and how they interact with each other. Increasingly, LLMs are
      being coupled with sensorimotor devices. LLMs can talk the talk, but can they
      walk the walk? A road map for achieving artificial general autonomy is outlined
      with seven major improvements inspired by brain systems and how LLMs could in
      turn be used to uncover new insights into brain function.", "venue": "Neural

      Turing Machines with Transformers", "abstract": "A common lens to theoretically
      study neural net architectures is to analyze the functions they can approximate.
      However, constructions from approximation theory may be unrealistic and therefore
      less meaningful. For example, a common unrealistic trick is to encode target
      function values using infinite precision. To address these issues, this work
      proposes a formal definition of statistically meaningful (SM) approximation
      which requires the approximating network to exhibit good statistical learnability.
      We study SM approximation for two function classes: boolean circuits and Turing
      machines. We show that overparameterized feedforward neural nets can SM approximate
      boolean circuits with sample complexity depending only polynomially on the circuit
      size, not the size of the network. In addition, we show that transformers can
      SM approximate Turing machines with computation time bounded by $T$ with sample
      complexity polynomial in the alphabet size, state space size, and $\\log (T)$.
      We also introduce new tools for analyzing generalization which provide much
      tighter sample complexities than the typical VC-dimension or norm-based bounds,
      which may be of independent interest.", "venue": "Neural Information Processing

      "Proof systems allow one party to prove to another party that a certain statement
      is true. Most existing practical proof systems require that the statement will
      be represented in terms of polynomial equations over a finite field. This makes
      the process of representing a statement that one wishes to prove or verify rather
      complicated, as this process requires a new set of equations for each statement.
      Various approaches to deal with this problem have been proposed, see for example
      [1]. We present Cairo, a practically-efficient Turing-complete STARK-friendly
      CPU architecture. We describe a single set of polynomial equations for the statement
      that the execution of a program on this architecture is valid. Given a statement
      one wishes to prove, Cairo allows writing a program that describes that statement,

      batteries are promising for use as energy storage devices owing to their low
      cost and high energy density. However, zinc chemistry commonly encounters serious
      dendrite issues, especially at high areal capacities and current densities,
      limiting their application. Herein, we propose a novel membrane featuring ordered
      undulating stripes called \"Turing patterns\", which can effectively suppress
      zinc dendrites and improve ion conductivity. The crests and troughs in the Turing
      membrane can effectively adjust the Zn(OH)42- distribution and provide more
      zinc deposition space. The coordinated Cu ions during membrane formation can
      interact with Zn(OH)42-, further smoothing zinc deposition. Even at a high current
      density of 80 mA\u00b7cm-2, the Turing membrane enables an alkaline zinc-iron
      flow battery (AZIFB) to work stably with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 160
      mA\u00b7h\u00b7cm-2 for approximately 110 cycles, showing an energy efficiency
      of 90.10%, which is by far the highest value ever reported among zinc-based

      "abstract": "In the nearly seven decades since the publication of Alan Turing\u2019s
      work on morphogenesis, enormous progress has been made in understanding both
      the mathematical and biological aspects of his proposed reaction\u2013diffusion
      theory. Some of these developments were nascent in Turing\u2019s paper, and
      others have been due to new insights from modern mathematical techniques, advances
      in numerical simulations and extensive biological experiments. Despite such
      progress, there are still important gaps between theory and experiment, with
      many examples of biological patterning where the underlying mechanisms are still
      unclear. Here, we review modern developments in the mathematical theory pioneered
      by Turing, showing how his approach has been generalized to a range of settings
      beyond the classical two-species reaction\u2013diffusion framework, including
      evolving and complex manifolds, systems heterogeneous in space and time, and
      more general reaction-transport equations. While substantial progress has been
      made in understanding these more complicated models, there are many remaining
      challenges that we highlight throughout. We focus on the mathematical theory,
      and in particular linear stability analysis of \u2018trivial\u2019 base states.
      We emphasize important open questions in developing this theory further, and
      discuss obstacles in using these techniques to understand biological reality.

      "abstract": "Turing structures at the nanoscale Turing structures arise when
      imbalances in diffusion rates make a stable steady-state system sensitive to
      small heterogeneous perturbations. For example, Turing patterns occur in chemical
      reactions when a fast-moving inhibitor controls the motion of a slower-moving
      activator. Tan et al. grew polyamide membranes by using interfacial polymerization,
      where the reactions occur at the interface between oil and water layers. The
      addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the aqueous phase reduced the diffusion of
      the monomer. This process generates membranes with more bumps, voids, and islands,
      which prove to be better for water desalination. Science, this issue p. 518
      Turing structures generated via diffusion-driven instabilities make polyamide
      membranes for water desalination. The emergence of Turing structures is of fundamental
      importance, and designing these structures and developing their applications
      have practical effects in chemistry and biology. We use a facile route based
      on interfacial polymerization to generate Turing-type polyamide membranes for
      water purification. Manipulation of shapes by control of reaction conditions
      enabled the creation of membranes with bubble or tube structures. These membranes
      exhibit excellent water-salt separation performance that surpasses the upper-bound

      Our development includes formalising the choreographic language and its basic
      properties, Kleene''s theory of partial recursive functions, the encoding of

      this effort, we show that theorem proving can be a very useful tool in the field

      "Importance: Chatbots could play a role in answering patient questions, but
      patients'' ability to distinguish between provider and chatbot responses, and
      patients'' trust in chatbots'' functions are not well established. Objective:
      To assess the feasibility of using ChatGPT or a similar AI-based chatbot for
      patient-provider communication. Design: Survey in January 2023 Setting: Survey
      Participants: A US representative sample of 400 study participants aged 18 and
      above was recruited on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform for academic studies.
      384 participants filled out the full survey. After removing participants who
      spent less than 3 minutes on the survey, 360 respondents remained. 53.3% of
      respondents analyzed were women; their average age was 45.4. Exposure(s): Ten
      representative non-administrative patient-provider interactions were extracted
      from the EHR. Patients'' questions were placed in ChatGPT with a request for
      the chatbot to respond using approximately the same word count as the human
      provider''s response. In the survey, each patient''s question was followed by
      a provider- or ChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that five
      responses were provider-generated and five were chatbot-generated. Participants
      were asked, and incentivized financially, to correctly identify the response
      source. Participants were also asked about their trust in chatbots'' functions
      in patient-provider communication, using a Likert scale of 1-5. Main Outcome(s)
      and Measure(s): Main outcome: Proportion of responses correctly classified as
      provider- vs chatbot-generated. Secondary outcomes: Average and standard deviation
      of responses to trust questions. Results: The correct classification of responses
      ranged between 23.4% to 86.7% for different questions. On average, chatbot responses
      were identified correctly 60.0% of the time and provider responses were identified
      correctly 62.3% of the time. On average, responses toward patients'' trust in
      chatbots'' functions were weakly positive (mean Likert score: 3.4), with lower
      trust as the health-related complexity of the task in questions increased. Conclusions
      and Relevance: ChatGPT responses to patient questions were close to indistinguishable
      from provider responses. Laypeople appear to trust the use of chatbots to answer
      lower risk health questions. It is important to continue studying patient-chatbot
      interaction as chatbots move from administrative to more clinical roles in healthcare.",

      higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both

      "Significance What kind of physics might be noncomputational? In this article,
      we address the appearance of undecidable phenomena in fluid dynamics, proving
      the existence of Turing complete fluid flows on a three-dimensional geometric
      domain. Our strategy fuses the computational power of symbolic dynamics with
      geometric techniques from contact topology and its connection with hydrodynamics
      unveiled by Sullivan, Etnyre, and Ghrist more than two decades ago. The type
      of flows that we consider are stationary solutions to the incompressible Euler
      equations. Taking these steady flows as initial data, we obtain global solutions
      to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations that can simulate just a (fixed) finite
      number of steps of any Turing machine. This raises the challenging question
      of the Turing-completeness of Navier\u2013Stokes. Can every physical system
      simulate any Turing machine? This is a classical problem that is intimately
      connected with the undecidability of certain physical phenomena. Concerning
      fluid flows, Moore [C. Moore, Nonlinearity 4, 199 (1991)] asked if hydrodynamics
      is capable of performing computations. More recently, Tao launched a program
      based on the Turing completeness of the Euler equations to address the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. In this direction, the undecidability
      of some physical systems has been studied in recent years, from the quantum
      gap problem to quantum-field theories. To the best of our knowledge, the existence
      of undecidable particle paths of three-dimensional fluid flows has remained
      an elusive open problem since Moore\u2019s works in the early 1990s. In this
      article, we construct a Turing complete stationary Euler flow on a Riemannian
      S3 and speculate on its implications concerning Tao\u2019s approach to the blow-up
      problem in the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      approaches promise to accelerate and improve success rates in medicinal chemistry

      molecules, within the appropriate chemical space. Many algorithms have been
      proposed for molecular generation, however a challenge is how to assess the

      designed to evaluate the performance of molecular generators. Profound differences
      were observed between the performance of molecule generators in these tests,
      highlighting the importance of selection of the appropriate design algorithms
      for specific circumstances. One molecule generator, based on match-molecular

      "In 2019, the rapid rate at which GPU manufacturers refresh their designs, coupled
      with their reluctance to disclose microarchitectural details, is still a hurdle
      for those software designers who want to extract the highest possible performance.
      Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture
      using microbenchmarks. \nThe introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia''s
      latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine
      Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations.
      Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications.
      We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the
      P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly
      higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. \nWe study
      the performance of the T4''s TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on
      low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces
      new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing''s
      instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions.
      We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as
      the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large
      as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4
      memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over
      its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive
      workloads that hit power or thermal limits. \nMany of our findings are novel,
      published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software
      developers get closer to the GPU''s peak performance.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      "title": "Stochastic Turing patterns in a synthetic bacterial population", "abstract":
      "Significance In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that biological morphogenesis could
      arise from a dynamical process in reaction systems with a rapidly diffusing
      inhibitor and a slowly diffusing activator. Turing\u2019s conditions are disappointingly
      hard to achieve in nature, but recent stochastic extension of the theory predicts
      pattern formation without such strong conditions. We have forward-engineered
      bacterial populations with signaling molecules that form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor
      system that does not satisfy the classic Turing conditions but exhibits disordered
      patterns with a defined length scale and spatial correlations that agree quantitatively
      with stochastic Turing theory. Our results suggest that Turing-type mechanisms,
      driven by gene expression or other source of stochasticity, may underlie a much
      broader range of patterns in nature than currently thought. The origin of biological
      morphology and form is one of the deepest problems in science, underlying our
      understanding of development and the functioning of living systems. In 1952,
      Alan Turing showed that chemical morphogenesis could arise from a linear instability
      of a spatially uniform state, giving rise to periodic pattern formation in reaction\u2013diffusion
      systems but only those with a rapidly diffusing inhibitor and a slowly diffusing
      activator. These conditions are disappointingly hard to achieve in nature, and
      the role of Turing instabilities in biological pattern formation has been called
      into question. Recently, the theory was extended to include noisy activator\u2013inhibitor
      birth and death processes. Surprisingly, this stochastic Turing theory predicts
      the existence of patterns over a wide range of parameters, in particular with
      no severe requirement on the ratio of activator\u2013inhibitor diffusion coefficients.
      To explore whether this mechanism is viable in practice, we have genetically
      engineered a synthetic bacterial population in which the signaling molecules
      form a stochastic activator\u2013inhibitor system. The synthetic pattern-forming
      gene circuit destabilizes an initially homogenous lawn of genetically engineered
      bacteria, producing disordered patterns with tunable features on a spatial scale
      much larger than that of a single cell. Spatial correlations of the experimental
      patterns agree quantitatively with the signature predicted by theory. These
      results show that Turing-type pattern-forming mechanisms, if driven by stochasticity,
      can potentially underlie a broad range of biological patterns. These findings
      provide the groundwork for a unified picture of biological morphogenesis, arising
      from a combination of stochastic gene expression and dynamical instabilities.",

      as malignant or benign is still an underlying challenge. To address this challenge,
      radiologists need computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems which can assist in
      learning discriminative imaging features corresponding to malignant and benign
      nodules. However, learning highly discriminative imaging features is an open
      problem. In this paper, our aim is to learn the most discriminative features
      pertaining to lung nodules by using an adversarial learning methodology. Specifically,
      we propose to use un-supervised learning with Deep Convolutional-Generative
      Adversarial Networks (DC-GANs) to generate lung nodule samples realistically.
      We hypothesize that imaging features of lung nodules will be discriminative
      if it is hard to differentiate them (fake) from real (true) nodules. To test
      this hypothesis, we present Visual Turing tests to two radiologists in order
      to evaluate the quality of the generated (fake) nodules. Extensive comparisons
      are performed in discerning real, generated, benign, and malignant nodules.
      This experimental set up allows us to validate the overall quality of the generated
      nodules, which can then be used to (1) improve diagnostic decisions by mining
      highly discriminative imaging features, (2) train radiologists for educational

      but less is known concerning symmetry-breaking instabilities in heterogeneous
      media. It is non-trivial to separate observed spatial patterning due to inherent
      spatial heterogeneity from emergent patterning due to nonlinear instability.
      We employ WKBJ asymptotics to investigate Turing instabilities for a spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion system, and derive conditions for instability
      which are local versions of the classical Turing conditions. We find that the
      structure of unstable modes differs substantially from the typical trigonometric
      functions seen in the spatially homogeneous setting. Modes of different growth
      rates are localized to different spatial regions. This localization helps explain
      common amplitude modulations observed in simulations of Turing systems in heterogeneous
      settings. We numerically demonstrate this theory, giving an illustrative example
      of the emergent instabilities and the striking complexity arising from spatially
      heterogeneous reaction\u2013diffusion systems. Our results give insight both
      into systems driven by exogenous heterogeneity, as well as successive pattern
      forming processes, noting that most scenarios in biology do not involve symmetry
      breaking from homogeneity, but instead consist of sequential evolutions of heterogeneous
      states. The instability mechanism reported here precisely captures such evolution,

      systems.", "abstract": "Mechanisms of pattern formation-of which the Turing
      instability is an archetype-constitute an important class of dynamical processes
      occurring in biological, ecological, and chemical systems. Recently, it has
      been shown that the Turing instability can induce pattern formation in discrete
      media such as complex networks, opening up the intriguing possibility of exploring
      it as a generative mechanism in a plethora of socioeconomic contexts. Yet much
      remains to be understood in terms of the precise connection between network
      topology and its role in inducing the patterns. Here we present a general mathematical
      description of a two-species reaction-diffusion process occurring on different
      flavors of network topology. The dynamical equations are of the predator-prey
      class that, while traditionally used to model species population, has also been
      used to model competition between antagonistic features in social contexts.
      We demonstrate that the Turing instability can be induced in any network topology
      by tuning the diffusion of the competing species or by altering network connectivity.
      The extent to which the emergent patterns reflect topological properties is
      determined by a complex interplay between the diffusion coefficients and the
      localization properties of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We find
      that networks with large degree fluctuations tend to have stable patterns over
      the space of initial perturbations, whereas patterns in more homogenous networks
      are purely stochastic.", "venue": "Physical Review E", "year": 2019, "referenceCount":

      Our result is also highly unusual in that all moves of both players are forced
      in the construction. This shows that even recognising who will win a game in
      which neither player has a non-trivial decision to make for the rest of the

      researchers today believe that each finger forms because of its unique position
      within the early limb bud. However, 30 years ago, developmental biologists proposed
      that the arrangement of fingers followed the Turing pattern, a self-organizing
      process during early embryo development. Raspopovic et al. provide evidence
      to support a Turing mechanism (see the Perspective by Zuniga and Zeller). They
      reveal that Bmp and Wnt signaling pathways, together with the gene Sox9, form

      this process is controlled by a self-organizing Turing mechanism, whereby diffusible

      simulation of digit patterning and show that this network, when modulated by
      morphogen gradients, recapitulates the expression patterns of Sox9 in the wild

      "title": "Visual Turing test for computer vision systems", "abstract": "Significance
      In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods
      of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations
      measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according
      to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding.
      We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares
      a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to
      probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition
      to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy
      in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated
      by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a
      story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted
      device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given
      test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides
      the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes
      the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered
      to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s
      answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question.
      Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural
      language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned
      from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the
      answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers,
      is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test
      is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions
      that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object,
      through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other
      uniquely instantiated objects.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy

      "title": "Comparative evaluation of autocontouring in clinical practice: A practical
      method using the Turing test", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAutomated techniques for
      estimating the contours of organs and structures in medical images have become
      more widespread and a variety of measures are available for assessing their
      quality. Quantitative measures of geometric agreement, for example, overlap
      with a gold-standard delineation, are popular but may not predict the level
      of clinical acceptance for the contouring method. Therefore, surrogate measures
      that relate more directly to the clinical judgment of contours, and to the way
      they are used in routine workflows, need to be developed. The purpose of this
      study is to propose a method (inspired by the Turing Test) for providing contour
      quality measures that directly draw upon practitioners'' assessments of manual
      and automatic contours. This approach assumes that an inability to distinguish
      automatically produced contours from those of clinical experts would indicate
      that the contours are of sufficient quality for clinical use. In turn, it is
      anticipated that such contours would receive less manual editing prior to being
      accepted for clinical use. In this study, an initial assessment of this approach
      is performed with radiation oncologists and therapists.\n\n\nMETHODS\nEight
      clinical observers were presented with thoracic organ-at-risk contours through
      a web interface and were asked to determine if they were automatically generated
      or manually delineated. The accuracy of the visual determination was assessed,
      and the proportion of contours for which the source was misclassified recorded.
      Contours of six different organs in a clinical workflow were for 20 patient
      cases. The time required to edit autocontours to a clinically acceptable standard
      was also measured, as a gold standard of clinical utility. Established quantitative
      measures of autocontouring performance, such as Dice similarity coefficient
      with respect to the original clinical contour and the misclassification rate
      accessed with the proposed framework, were evaluated as surrogates of the editing
      time measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe misclassification rates for each organ were:
      esophagus 30.0%, heart 22.9%, left lung 51.2%, right lung 58.5%, mediastinum
      envelope 43.9%, and spinal cord 46.8%. The time savings resulting from editing
      the autocontours compared to the standard clinical workflow were 12%, 25%, 43%,
      77%, 46%, and 50%, respectively, for these organs. The median Dice similarity
      coefficients between the clinical contours and the autocontours were 0.46, 0.90,
      0.98, 0.98, 0.94, and 0.86, respectively, for these organs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA
      better correspondence with time saving was observed for the misclassification
      rate than the quantitative contour measures explored. From this, we conclude
      that the inability to accurately judge the source of a contour indicates a reduced
      need for editing and therefore a greater time saving overall. Hence, task-based
      assessments of contouring performance may be considered as an additional way
      of evaluating the clinical utility of autosegmentation methods.", "venue": "Medical

      Vertebrates have a vast array of epithelial appendages, including scales, feathers,
      and hair. The developmental patterning of these diverse structures can be theoretically
      explained by Alan Turing\u2019s reaction-diffusion system. However, the role
      of this system in epithelial appendage patterning of early diverging lineages
      (compared to tetrapods), such as the cartilaginous fishes, is poorly understood.
      We investigate patterning of the unique tooth-like skin denticles of sharks,
      which closely relates to their hydrodynamic and protective functions. We demonstrate
      through simulation models that a Turing-like mechanism can explain shark denticle
      patterning and verify this system using gene expression analysis and gene pathway
      inhibition experiments. This mechanism bears remarkable similarity to avian
      feather patterning, suggesting deep homology of the system. We propose that
      a diverse range of vertebrate appendages, from shark denticles to avian feathers
      and mammalian hair, use this ancient and conserved system, with slight genetic
      modulation accounting for broad variations in patterning.", "venue": "Science

      "title": "Post-Turing tissue pattern formation: Advent of mechanochemistry",
      "abstract": "Chemical and mechanical pattern formation is fundamental during
      embryogenesis and tissue development. Yet, the underlying molecular and cellular
      mechanisms are still elusive in many cases. Most current theories assume that
      tissue development is driven by chemical processes: either as a sequence of
      chemical patterns each depending on the previous one, or by patterns spontaneously
      arising from specific chemical interactions (such as \u201cTuring-patterns\u201d).
      Within both theories, mechanical patterns are usually regarded as passive by-products
      of chemical pre-patters. However, several experiments question these theories,
      and an increasing number of studies shows that tissue mechanics can actively
      influence chemical patterns during development. In this study, we thus focus
      on the interplay between chemical and mechanical processes during tissue development.
      On one hand, based on recent experimental data, we develop new mechanochemical
      simulation models of evolving tissues, in which the full 3D representation of
      the tissue appears to be critical for obtaining a realistic mechanochemical
      behaviour. The presented modelling approach is flexible and numerically studied
      using state of the art finite element methods. Thus, it may serve as a basis
      to combine simulations with new experimental methods in tissue development.
      On the other hand, we apply the developed approach and demonstrate that even
      simple interactions between tissue mechanics and chemistry spontaneously lead
      to robust and complex mechanochemical patterns. Especially, we demonstrate that
      the main contradictions arising in the framework of purely chemical theories
      are naturally and automatically resolved using the mechanochemical patterning
      theory.", "venue": "PLoS Comput. Biol.", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 102,

      model explains how identical cells can self-organize to form spatial patterns.
      It has been suggested that extracellular signaling molecules with different
      diffusion coefficients underlie this model, but the contribution of cell-autonomous
      signaling components is largely unknown. We developed an automated mathematical
      analysis to derive a catalog of realistic Turing networks. This analysis reveals
      that in the presence of cell-autonomous factors, networks can form a pattern
      with equally diffusing signals and even for any combination of diffusion coefficients.
      We provide a software (available at http://www.RDNets.com) to explore these
      networks and to constrain topologies with qualitative and quantitative experimental
      data. We use the software to examine the self-organizing networks that control
      embryonic axis specification and digit patterning. Finally, we demonstrate how
      existing synthetic circuits can be extended with additional feedbacks to form
      Turing reaction-diffusion systems. Our study offers a new theoretical framework
      to understand multicellular pattern formation and enables the wide-spread use
      of mathematical biology to engineer synthetic patterning systems. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14022.001",

      estimate species richness if there are many almost undetectable species in a
      hyper\u2010diverse community. Practically, an accurate lower bound for species
      richness is preferable to an inaccurate point estimator. The traditional nonparametric
      lower bound developed by Chao (1984, Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11,
      265\u2013270) for individual\u2010based abundance data uses only the information
      on the rarest species (the numbers of singletons and doubletons) to estimate
      the number of undetected species in samples. Applying a modified Good\u2013Turing
      frequency formula, we derive an approximate formula for the first\u2010order
      bias of this traditional lower bound. The approximate bias is estimated by using
      additional information (namely, the numbers of tripletons and quadrupletons).
      This approximate bias can be corrected, and an improved lower bound is thus
      obtained. The proposed lower bound is nonparametric in the sense that it is
      universally valid for any species abundance distribution. A similar type of
      improved lower bound can be derived for incidence data. We test our proposed
      lower bounds on simulated data sets generated from various species abundance
      models. Simulation results show that the proposed lower bounds always reduce
      bias over the traditional lower bounds and improve accuracy (as measured by
      mean squared error) when the heterogeneity of species abundances is relatively
      high. We also apply the proposed new lower bounds to real data for illustration

      in Proceedings of the 34th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer
      Science, pp. 352\u2013361, proved that quantum Turing machines and quantum circuits
      are polynomially equivalent computational models: t\u2265n steps of a quantum
      Turing machine running on an input of length n can be simulated by a uniformly
      generated family of quantum circuits with size quadratic in t, and a polynomial-time
      uniformly generated family of quantum circuits can be simulated by a quantum
      Turing machine running in polynomial time. We revisit the simulation of quantum
      Turing machines with uniformly generated quantum circuits, which is the more
      challenging of the two simulation tasks, and present a variation on the simulation
      method employed by Yao together with an analysis of it. This analysis reveals
      that the simulation of quantum Turing machines can be performed by quantum circuits
      having depth linear in t, rather than quadratic depth, and can be extended to
      variants of quantum Turing machines, such as ones having multi-dimensional tapes.
      Our analysis is based on an extension of method described by Arright, Nesme
      and Werner in 2011 in Journal of Computer and System Sciences 77, 372\u2013378.

      "title": "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines", "abstract": "The expressive
      power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential
      computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been
      more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number
      of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing
      Machine (NTM) [8] is a model that can compactly express an even greater number
      of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its
      memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM
      can be trained with backpropagation. While differentiable memory is relatively
      easy to implement and train, it necessitates accessing the entire memory content
      at each computational step. This makes it difficult to implement a fast NTM.
      In this work, we use the Re inforce algorithm to learn where to access the memory,
      while using backpropagation to learn what to write to the memory. We call this
      model the RL-NTM. Reinforce allows our model to access a constant number of
      memory cells at each computational step, so its implementation can be faster.
      The RL-NTM is the first mo del that can, in principle, learn programs of unbounded
      running time. We successfully trained the RL-NTM to solve a number of algorithmic
      tasks that are simpler than the ones solvable by the fully differentiable NTM.
      As the RL-NTM is a fairly intricate model, we needed a method for verifying
      the correctness of our implementation. To do so, we developed a simple technique
      for numerically checking arbitrary implementations of models that use Reinforce,

      "The process of pattern formation for a multispecies model anchored on a time
      varying network is studied. A nonhomogeneous perturbation superposed to an homogeneous
      stable fixed point can be amplified following the Turing mechanism of instability,
      solely instigated by the network dynamics. By properly tuning the frequency
      of the imposed network evolution, one can make the examined system behave as
      its averaged counterpart, over a finite time window. This is the key observation
      to derive a closed analytical prediction for the onset of the instability in
      the time dependent framework. Continuously and piecewise constant periodic time
      varying networks are analyzed, setting the framework for the proposed approach.
      The extension to nonperiodic settings is also discussed.", "venue": "Physical

      "abstract": "We extend neural Turing machine (NTM) model into a dynamic neural
      Turing machine (D-NTM) by introducing a trainable memory addressing scheme.
      This addressing scheme maintains for each memory cell two separate vectors,
      content and address vectors. This allows the D-NTM to learn a wide variety of
      location-based addressing strategies including both linear and nonlinear ones.
      We implement the D-NTM with both continuous, differentiable and discrete, non-differentiable
      read/write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and effects of learning
      to read and write into a memory through experiments on Facebook bAbI tasks using
      both a feedforward and GRUcontroller. The D-NTM is evaluated on a set of Facebook
      bAbI tasks and shown to outperform NTM and LSTM baselines. We have done extensive
      analysis of our model and different variations of NTM on bAbI task. We also
      provide further experimental results on sequential pMNIST, Stanford Natural
      Language Inference, associative recall and copy tasks.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

      commitment is unconditionally sound for a select piece of the storage. This
      primitive serves as an \"iO-friendly\" tool that allows us to make two different
      programs equivalent at different stages of a proof. The pieces of storage that
      are selected depend on what hybrid stage we are at in a proof. We first build

      experimental results obtained using this artificial cellular system establish
      the strengths and weaknesses of the Turing model, applicable to biology and
      materials science alike, and pinpoint which directions are required for improvement.
      Alan Turing, in \u201cThe Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\u201d [Turing AM (1952)
      Philos Trans R Soc Lond 237(641):37\u201372], described how, in circular arrays
      of identical biological cells, diffusion can interact with chemical reactions
      to generate up to six periodic spatiotemporal chemical structures. Turing proposed
      that one of these structures, a stationary pattern with a chemically determined
      wavelength, is responsible for differentiation. We quantitatively test Turing\u2019s
      ideas in a cellular chemical system consisting of an emulsion of aqueous droplets
      containing the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky oscillatory chemical reactants, dispersed
      in oil, and demonstrate that reaction-diffusion processes lead to chemical differentiation,
      which drives physical morphogenesis in chemical cells. We observe five of the
      six structures predicted by Turing. In 2D hexagonal arrays, a seventh structure
      emerges, incompatible with Turing\u2019s original model, which we explain by
      modifying the theory to include heterogeneity.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

      driven instability has been hypothesized as a mechanism to drive spatial self-organization
      in biological systems since the seminal work of Turing. Such systems are often
      considered on a growing domain, but traditional theoretical studies have only
      treated the domain size as a bifurcation parameter, neglecting the system non-autonomy.
      More recently, the conditions for a diffusively driven instability on a growing
      domain have been determined under stringent conditions, including slow growth,
      a restriction on the temporal interval over which the prospect of an instability
      can be considered and a neglect of the impact that time evolution has on the
      stability properties of the homogeneous reference state from which heterogeneity
      emerges. Here, we firstly relax this latter assumption and observe that the
      conditions for the Turing instability are much more complex and depend on the
      history of the system in general. We proceed to relax all the above constraints,
      making analytical progress by focusing on specific examples. With faster growth,
      instabilities can grow transiently and decay, making the prediction of a prospective
      Turing instability much more difficult. In addition, arbitrarily high spatial
      frequencies can destabilize, in which case the continuum approximation is predicted

      "abstract": "\n \n Penetration testing (pentesting) is a well established method
      for identifying security weaknesses, by conducting friendly attacks. Simulated
      pentesting automates this process, through designing a model of the system at
      hand, and using model-based attack planning to generate the attacks. Classical
      planning variants of this idea are being used commercially by the pentesting
      industry since 2010. Such models can pinpoint potentially dangerous combinations
      of known vulnerabilities, but ignore the incomplete knowledge characteristic
      of hacking from the attacker''s point of view. Yet, ideally, the simulation
      should conduct its attacks the same way a real attacker would. Hence the ultimate
      goal is much more ambitious: to realistically simulate a human hacker. This
      is a grand vision indeed; e.g., the classical Turing Test can be viewed as a
      sub-problem. Taking a more practical perspective, the simulated pentesting model
      space spans a broad range of sequential decision making problems. Analyzing
      prior work in AI and other relevant areas, we derive a systematization of this
      model space, highlighting a multitude of interesting challenges to AI sequential

      "An unsolved problem in neuroevolution (NE) is to evolve artificial neural networks
      (ANN) that can store and use information to change their behavior online. While
      plastic neural networks have shown promise in this context, they have difficulties
      retaining information over longer periods of time and integrating new information
      without losing previously acquired skills. Here we build on recent work by Graves
      et al. [5] who extended the capabilities of an ANN by combining it with an external
      memory bank trained through gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce an
      evolvable version of their Neural Turing Machine (NTM) and show that such an
      approach greatly simplifies the neural model, generalizes better, and does not
      require accessing the entire memory content at each time-step. The Evolvable
      Neural Turing Machine (ENTM) is able to solve a simple copy tasks and for the
      first time, the continuous version of the double T-Maze, a complex reinforcement-like
      learning problem. In the T-Maze learning task the agent uses the memory bank
      to display adaptive behavior that normally requires a plastic ANN, thereby suggesting
      a complementary and effective mechanism for adaptive behavior in NE.", "venue":

      "The formation of ordered structures, in particular Turing patterns, in complex
      spatially extended systems has been observed in many different contexts, spanning
      from natural sciences (chemistry, physics, and biology) to technology (mechanics
      and electronics). In this paper, it is shown that the use of memristors in a
      simple cell of a spatially-extended circuit architecture allows us to design
      systems able to generate Turing patterns. In addition, the memristor parameters
      play a key role in the selection of the type and characteristics of the emerging
      pattern, which is also influenced by the initial conditions. The problem of
      finding the regions of parameters where Turing patterns may emerge in the proposed
      cellular architecture is solved in an analytic way, and numerical results are
      shown to illustrate the system behavior with respect to its parameters.", "venue":

      "Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning
      tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,
      add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly
      in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,
      and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
      \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
      For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following
      two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well
      as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to
      a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the
      best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but
      as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all
      symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
      over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant
      of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
      from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
      1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
      at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
      and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "Neural

      on Turing (1952) \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019", "abstract":
      "Alan Turing was neither a biologist nor a chemist, and yet the paper he published
      in 1952, \u2018The chemical basis of morphogenesis\u2019, on the spontaneous
      formation of patterns in systems undergoing reaction and diffusion of their
      ingredients has had a substantial impact on both fields, as well as in other
      areas as disparate as geomorphology and criminology. Motivated by the question
      of how a spherical embryo becomes a decidedly non-spherical organism such as
      a human being, Turing devised a mathematical model that explained how random
      fluctuations can drive the emergence of pattern and structure from initial uniformity.
      The spontaneous appearance of pattern and form in a system far away from its
      equilibrium state occurs in many types of natural process, and in some artificial
      ones too. It is often driven by very general mechanisms, of which Turing''s
      model supplies one of the most versatile. For that reason, these patterns show
      striking similarities in systems that seem superficially to share nothing in
      common, such as the stripes of sand ripples and of pigmentation on a zebra skin.
      New examples of \u2018Turing patterns'' in biology and beyond are still being
      discovered today. This commentary was written to celebrate the 350th anniversary

      the Turing instability in a specific gene circuit that can be implemented in

      homoserine lactone (AHL) and long-range inhibitor hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) gas.
      Slowing the production rate of the AHL-degrading enzyme, AiiA, generates stable
      fixed states, limit cycle oscillations and Turing patterns. Further tuning of
      signaling parameters determines local robustness and controls the range of unstable
      wavenumbers in the patterning regime. These findings provide a roadmap for optimizing
      spatial patterns of gene expression based on familiar quorum and gas sensitive

      "title": "Answering Descartes: Beyond Turing", "abstract": "Introduction The
      first half of the twentieth Century was filled with a stunning group of scientists,
      Einstein, Bohr, von Neumann and others. Alan Turing ranks near the top of this
      group. I am honored to contribute to this volume commemorating his work. How
      much do we owe one mind? His was a pivotal role in the cracking of the Nazi
      war code, which profoundly aided the defeat of Nazism. His invention of the
      Turing machine has revolutionized modern society, from universal Turing machines
      to all digital computers and the IT revolution. His model of morphogenesis,
      the first example of a \u2018dissipative structure\u2019, to use Prigogine''s
      phrase, is one I have myself used as a developmental biologist. I rightly praise
      Turing, but seek in this chapter to go beyond him. The core issue is the human
      mind. Two lines of thought, one stemming from Turing himself, the other from
      none other than Bertrand Russell, have led to a dominant view that the human
      mind arises as some kind of vast network of logic gates, or classical physicsconsciousness
      neurons'', to use F. Crick''s phrase in The Astonishing Hypothesis (Crick, 1994),
      connected in the 10 11 neurons of the human brain. I think this view could well
      be right, but is more likely to be wrong. My aim in this chapter is to sketch
      the lines of thought that lead to the standard view in computer science and
      much of neurobiology, and note some of the philosophic claims for and doubts
      about the claim; but most importantly I wish to explore the emerging behavior
      of open quantum systems in an environment, their new physics, and, centrally,
      our capacity to construct what I will call non-algorithmic, non-determinate
      yet non-random Trans-Turing Systems. As we shall see, Trans-Turing Systems are
      not determinate, for they inherit the indeterminism of their open quantum system
      aspects, yet they are non-random owing to their classical aspects. They are
      new to us and may move us decisively beyond the beauty, and limitations, of
      Turing''s justly famous, but purely classical-physics, discrete-time and discrete-state
      machine. Beyond the above, I shall make one truly radical proposal that I believe
      grows out of \u201csum over all possible histories\u201d formulation of quantum
      mechanics (Feynman,1948).", "venue": "European Conference on Artificial Life",

      At low detunings from resonance, switching occurs between the stable stationary

      "title": "Towards a Visual Turing Challenge", "abstract": "As language and visual
      understanding by machines progresses rapidly, we are observing an increasing
      interest in holistic architectures that tightly interlink both modalities in
      a joint learning and inference process. This trend has allowed the community
      to progress towards more challenging and open tasks and refueled the hope at
      achieving the old AI dream of building machines that could pass a turing test
      in open domains. In order to steadily make progress towards this goal, we realize
      that quantifying performance becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore we ask
      how we can precisely define such challenges and how we can evaluate different
      algorithms on this open tasks? In this paper, we summarize and discuss such
      challenges as well as try to give answers where appropriate options are available
      in the literature. We exemplify some of the solutions on a recently presented
      dataset of question-answering task based on real-world indoor images that establishes
      a visual turing challenge. Finally, we argue despite the success of unique ground-truth
      annotation, we likely have to step away from carefully curated dataset and rather
      rely on ''social consensus'' as the main driving force to create suitable benchmarks.
      Providing coverage in this inherently ambiguous output space is an emerging
      challenge that we face in order to make quantifiable progress in this area.",

      the interface of nanotechnology and zoology, evolution and biophysics, and ecology
      and genetics, sheds light on the molecular origin and evolutionary diversification
      of a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures. It also describes,
      to our knowledge, the first-ever biological example of Turing nanopatterns.
      Nipple-like nanostructures covering the corneal surfaces of moths, butterflies,
      and Drosophila have been studied by electron and atomic force microscopy, and
      their antireflective properties have been described. In contrast, corneal nanostructures
      of the majority of other insect orders have either been unexamined or examined
      by methods that did not allow precise morphological characterization. Here we
      provide a comprehensive analysis of corneal surfaces in 23 insect orders, revealing
      a rich diversity of insect corneal nanocoatings. These nanocoatings are categorized
      into four major morphological patterns and various transitions between them,
      many, to our knowledge, never described before. Remarkably, this unexpectedly
      diverse range of the corneal nanostructures replicates the complete set of Turing
      patterns, thus likely being a result of processes similar to those modeled by
      Alan Turing in his famous reaction\u2212diffusion system. These findings reveal
      a beautiful diversity of insect corneal nanostructures and shed light on their
      molecular origin and evolutionary diversification. They may also be the first-ever
      biological example of Turing nanopatterns.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National

      critical value of the time delay, above which a Turing instability occurs. Then
      we apply the technique to a predator-prey model and study the pattern formation
      of the model due to the delay. For the model in question, we find that when
      the time delay is small it has a uniform steady state or irregular patterns,
      which are not of Turing type; however, in the presence of a large delay we find
      spiral patterns of Turing type. For such a model, we also find that the critical
      delay is a decreasing function of the ratio of carrying capacity to half saturation

      "abstract": "We study the computational capabilities of a biologically inspired
      neural model where the synaptic weights, the connectivity pattern, and the number
      of neurons can evolve over time rather than stay static. Our study focuses on
      the mere concept of plasticity of the model so that the nature of the updates
      is assumed to be not constrained. In this context, we show that the so-called
      plastic recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of the precise super-Turing
      computational power--as the static analog neural networks--irrespective of whether
      their synaptic weights are modeled by rational or real numbers, and moreover,
      irrespective of whether their patterns of plasticity are restricted to bi-valued
      updates or expressed by any other more general form of updating. Consequently,
      the incorporation of only bi-valued plastic capabilities in a basic model of
      RNNs suffices to break the Turing barrier and achieve the super-Turing level
      of computation. The consideration of more general mechanisms of architectural
      plasticity or of real synaptic weights does not further increase the capabilities
      of the networks. These results support the claim that the general mechanism
      of plasticity is crucially involved in the computational and dynamical capabilities

      "abstract": "It is hard to bridge the gap between mathematical formulations
      and biological implementations of Turing patterns, yet this is necessary for
      both understanding and engineering these networks with synthetic biology approaches.
      Here, we model a reaction\u2013diffusion system with two morphogens in a monostable
      regime, inspired by components that we recently described in a synthetic biology
      study in mammalian cells.1 The model employs a single promoter to express both
      the activator and inhibitor genes and produces Turing patterns over large regions
      of parameter space, using biologically interpretable Hill function reactions.
      We applied a stability analysis and identified rules for choosing biologically
      tunable parameter relationships to increase the likelihood of successful patterning.
      We show how to control Turing pattern sizes and time evolution by manipulating

      analysis predicts that steep dose\u2013response functions arising from cooperativity
      are mandatory for Turing patterns. Greater steepness increases parameter space
      and even reduces the requirement for differential diffusion between activator
      and inhibitor. These results demonstrate some of the limitations of linear scenarios

      "During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing 1912--1954 has been widely
      celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption,
      Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate Turing''s
      motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as
      expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments
      within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In
      particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also
      the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level
      AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine a machine
      which learns like an infant dominates the closing section of the paper, in which
      he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three
      alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: 1 AI by programming,
      2 AI by ab initio machine learning and 3 AI using logic, probabilities, learning
      and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in
      the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We
      compare Turing''s three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude
      with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper.",

      system to describe species anomalous superdiffusion. The effects of the superdiffusive
      exponent on pattern formation and pattern selection are studied. Our linear
      stability analysis shows that the wave number of the Turing pattern increases
      with the superdiffusive exponent. A weakly nonlinear analysis yields a system
      of amplitude equations and the analysis of these amplitude equations predicts
      parameter regimes where hexagons, stripes, and their coexistence are expected.
      Numerical simulations of the activator-inhibitor model near the stability boundaries
      confirm our analytical results. Since diffusion rate manifests in both diffusion
      constant and diffusion exponent, we numerically explore their interactions on
      the emergence of Turing patterns. When the activator and inhibitor have different
      superdiffusive exponents, we find that the critical ratio of the diffusion rate
      of the inhibitor to the activator, required for the formation of the Turing
      pattern, increases monotonically with the superdiffusive exponent. We conclude
      that small ratio (than unity) of anomalous diffusion exponent between the inhibitor
      and activator is more likely to promote the emergence of the Turing pattern,

      Neural Text Generation", "abstract": "Recent progress in generative language
      models has enabled machines to generate astonishingly realistic texts. While
      there are many legitimate applications of such models, there is also a rising
      need to distinguish machine-generated texts from human-written ones (e.g., fake
      news detection). However, to our best knowledge, there is currently no benchmark
      environment with datasets and tasks to systematically study the so-called\"Turing
      Test\"problem for neural text generation methods. In this work, we present the
      TuringBench benchmark environment, which is comprised of (1) a dataset with
      200K human- or machine-generated samples across 20 labels {Human, GPT-1, GPT-2_small,
      GPT-2_medium, GPT-2_large, GPT-2_xl, GPT-2_PyTorch, GPT-3, GROVER_base, GROVER_large,
      GROVER_mega, CTRL, XLM, XLNET_base, XLNET_large, FAIR_wmt19, FAIR_wmt20, TRANSFORMER_XL,
      PPLM_distil, PPLM_gpt2}, (2) two benchmark tasks -- i.e., Turing Test (TT) and
      Authorship Attribution (AA), and (3) a website with leaderboards. Our preliminary
      experimental results using TuringBench show that FAIR_wmt20 and GPT-3 are the
      current winners, among all language models tested, in generating the most human-like
      indistinguishable texts with the lowest F1 score by five state-of-the-art TT
      detection models. The TuringBench is available at: https://turingbench.ist.psu.edu/",

      "title": "Token Turing Machines", "abstract": "We propose Token Turing Machines
      (TTM), a sequential, autoregressive Transformer model with memory for real-world
      sequential visual understanding. Our model is inspired by the seminal Neural
      Turing Machine, and has an external memory consisting of a set of tokens which
      summarise the previous history (i.e., frames). This memory is efficiently addressed,
      read and written using a Transformer as the processing unit/controller at each
      step. The model''s memory module ensures that a new observation will only be
      processed with the contents of the memory (and not the entire history), meaning
      that it can efficiently process long sequences with a bounded computational
      cost at each step. We show that TTM outperforms other alternatives, such as
      other Transformer models designed for long sequences and recurrent neural networks,
      on two real-world sequential visual understanding tasks: online temporal activity
      detection from videos and vision-based robot action policy learning. Code is

      "title": "RDMA is Turing complete, we just did not know it yet!", "abstract":
      "It is becoming increasingly popular for distributed systems to exploit offload
      to reduce load on the CPU. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) offload, in particular,
      has become popular. However, RDMA still requires CPU intervention for complex
      offloads that go beyond simple remote memory access. As such, the offload potential
      is limited and RDMA-based systems usually have to work around such limitations.
      We present RedN, a principled, practical approach to implementing complex RDMA
      offloads, without requiring any hardware modifications. Using self-modifying
      RDMA chains, we lift the existing RDMA verbs interface to a Turing complete
      set of programming abstractions. We explore what is possible in terms of offload
      complexity and performance with a commodity RDMA NIC. We show how to integrate
      these RDMA chains into applications, such as the Memcached key-value store,
      allowing us to offload complex tasks such as key lookups. RedN can reduce the
      latency of key-value get operations by up to 2.6x compared to state-of-the-art
      KV designs that use one-sided RDMA primitives (e.g., FaRM-KV), as well as traditional
      RPC-over-RDMA approaches. Moreover, compared to these baselines, RedN provides
      performance isolation and, in the presence of contention, can reduce latency
      by up to 35x while providing applications with failure resiliency to OS and
      process crashes.", "venue": "Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation",

      distinguishing true human and agent behavior. At the same time, we show that

      "title": "Neuromorphic Computing is Turing-Complete", "abstract": "Neuromorphic
      computing is a non-von Neumann computing paradigm that performs computation
      by emulating the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are extremely energy-efficient
      and known to consume thousands of times less power than CPUs and GPUs. They
      have the potential to drive critical use cases such as autonomous vehicles,
      edge computing and internet of things in the future. For this reason, they are
      sought to be an indispensable part of the future computing landscape. Neuromorphic
      systems are mainly used for spike-based machine learning applications, although
      there are some non-machine learning applications in graph theory, differential
      equations, and spike-based simulations. These applications suggest that neuromorphic
      computing might be capable of general-purpose computing. However, general-purpose
      computability of neuromorphic computing has not been established yet. In this
      work, we prove that neuromorphic computing is Turing-complete and therefore
      capable of general-purpose computing. Specifically, we present a model of neuromorphic
      computing, with just two neuron parameters (threshold and leak), and two synaptic
      parameters (weight and delay). We devise neuromorphic circuits for computing
      all the \u03bc-recursive functions (i.e., constant, successor and projection
      functions) and all the \u03bc-recursive operators (i.e., composition, primitive
      recursion and minimization operators). Given that the \u03bc-recursive functions
      and operators are precisely the ones that can be computed using a Turing machine,
      this work establishes the Turing-completeness of neuromorphic computing.", "venue":

      higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements at both

      Codes", "abstract": "Proving a capacity result usually involves two parts: achievability
      and converse which establish matching lower and upper bounds on the capacity.
      For achievability, only the existence of good (capacity-achieving) codes is
      usually shown. Although the existence of such optimal codes is known, constructing
      such capacity-achieving codes has been open for a long time. Recently, significant
      progress has been made and optimal code constructions have been found including
      for example polar codes. A crucial observation is that all these constructions
      are done for a fixed and given channel and this paper addresses the question
      whether or not it is possible to find universal algorithms that can construct
      optimal codes for a whole class of channels. For this purpose, the concept of
      Turing machines is used which provides the fundamental performance limits of
      digital computers. It is shown that there exists no universal Turing machine
      that takes the channel from the class of interest as an input and outputs optimal
      codes. Finally, implications on channel-aware transmission schemes are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The Turing test centers on the idea that if a computer could trick
      a human into believing that it was human, then the machine was deemed to be
      intelligent or indistinguishable from people. Designing a visual Turing test
      involves recognizing objects and their relationships on images and creating
      a method to derive new concepts from the visual information. Until now, the
      proposed visual tests heavily use natural language processing to conduct the
      questionnaire or storytelling. We deviate from the mainstream, and we propose
      to reframe the visual Turing test through the Kuleshov effect to avoid written
      or spoken language. The idea resides on elucidating a method that creates the
      concept of montage synthetically. Like the first days of cinema, we would like
      to convey messages with the interpretation of image shots that a machine could
      decipher while comparing it with those scored by humans. The first implementation
      of this new test uses images from a psychology study where the circumplex model
      is applied to rate each image. We consider five deep learning methodologies
      and eight optimizers, and through semiotics, we derive an emotional state in
      the computer. The results are promising since we confirm that this version of
      the visual Turing test is challenging as a new research avenue.", "venue": "2021

      superpolynomial circuit lower bounds for exponential time would follow. This
      has triggered a long line of work on understanding the power of reductions to
      MCSP. Nothing was known so far about consequences of NP-hardness of MCSP under
      general Turing reductions. In this work, we consider two structured kinds of
      Turing reductions: parametric honest reductions and natural reductions. The
      latter generalize the natural reductions of Kabanets and Cai to the case of
      Turing-reductions. We show that NP-hardness of MCSP under these kinds of Turing-reductions

      deep classifiers are intriguingly vulnerable to universal adversarial perturbations:
      single disturbances of small magnitude that lead to misclassification of most
      inputs. This phenomena may potentially result in a serious security problem.
      Despite the extensive research in this area, there is a lack of theoretical
      understanding of the structure of these perturbations. In image domain, there
      is a certain visual similarity between patterns, that represent these perturbations,
      and classical Turing patterns, which appear as a solution of non-linear partial
      differential equations and are underlying concept of many processes in nature.
      In this paper, we provide a theoretical bridge between these two different theories,
      by mapping a simplified algorithm for crafting universal perturbations to (inhomogeneous)
      cellular automata, the latter is known to generate Turing patterns. Furthermore,
      we propose to use Turing patterns, generated by cellular automata, as universal
      perturbations, and experimentally show that they significantly degrade the performance
      of deep learning models. We found this method to be a fast and efficient way
      to create a data-agnostic quasi-imperceptible perturbation in the black-box

      aspect of Turing tests for motor intelligence where humans have to interact

      "abstract": "Deep learning based knowledge tracing approaches achieve high accuracy
      in mastery prediction with pattern extraction on a large learning behavior data
      set. However, when there is little training data available, these approaches
      either fail to extract the key patterns or result in over fitting. Ideally,
      we aim to provide a similar learning experience to both the first group of learners,
      who interact with a new course or a new activity with little learning behavior
      data to provide personalized guidance, and the learners who interact with the
      course later. We propose a novel architecture, Attentive Neural Turing Machine
      (ANTM), to solve the cold start knowledge tracing problem. The proposed ANTM
      comprises an attentive controller module and differential reading and writing
      processes with extra memory bank. Accuracy (ACC) and Area Under Curve (AUC)
      measures are used for model performance comparison. Results show the proposed
      approach can learn fast and generalize well to unseen data. It achieves around
      95% ACC trained with only 3 learners, while conventional deep learning based
      approaches achieve only 65% ACC with over prediction issues.", "venue": "ACM

      with a high mortality rate. Early detection of pulmonary nodules by screening
      with a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan is crucial for its effective clinical

      is a tedious task and presents a high risk of human errors. To tackle this problem
      we propose a computationally efficient two stage framework. In the first stage,
      a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained adversarially using Turing test
      loss segments the lung region. In the second stage, patches sampled from the
      segmented region are then classified to detect the presence of nodules. The

      "abstract": "We extend the notion of lossy kernelization, introduced by Lokshtanov
      et al. [STOC 2017], to approximate Turing kernelization. An $\\alpha$-approximate
      Turing kernel for a parameterized optimization problem is a polynomial-time
      algorithm that, when given access to an oracle that outputs $c$-approximate
      solutions in $O(1)$ time, obtains an $(\\alpha \\cdot c)$-approximate solution
      to the considered problem, using calls to the oracle of size at most $f(k)$
      for some function $f$ that only depends on the parameter. \nUsing this definition,
      we show that Independent Set parameterized by treewidth $\\ell$ has a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate
      Turing kernel with $O(\\frac{\\ell^2}{\\varepsilon})$ vertices, answering an
      open question posed by Lokshtanov et al. [STOC 2017]. Furthermore, we give $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate
      Turing kernels for the following graph problems parameterized by treewidth:
      Vertex Cover, Edge Clique Cover, Edge-Disjoint Triangle Packing and Connected
      Vertex Cover. \nWe generalize the result for Independent Set and Vertex Cover,
      by showing that all graph problems that we will call \"friendly\" admit $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate
      Turing kernels of polynomial size when parameterized by treewidth. We use this
      to obtain approximate Turing kernels for Vertex-Disjoint $H$-packing for connected

      sentiment polarity expressed towards a given opinion target in a sentence. The
      sentiment polarity of the target is not only highly determined by sentiment
      semantic context but also correlated with the concerned opinion target. Existing
      works cannot effectively capture and store the inter-dependence between the
      opinion target and its context. To solve this issue, we propose a novel model
      of Attentive Neural Turing Machines (ANTM). Via interactive read-write operations
      between an external memory storage and a recurrent controller, ANTM can learn
      the dependable correlation of the opinion target to context and concentrate
      on crucial sentiment information. Specifically, ANTM separates the information
      of storage and computation, which extends the capabilities of the controller
      to learn and store sequential features. The read and write operations enable
      ANTM to adaptively keep track of the interactive attention history between memory
      content and controller state. Moreover, we append target entity embeddings into
      both input and output of the controller in order to augment the integration
      of target information. We evaluate our model on SemEval2014 dataset which contains

      growth in the capabilities and deployment of artificial intelligence systems
      based on deep neural networks. These are visible through the speech recognition
      and natural language processing of Alexa/Siri/Google that structure many of
      our everyday interactions, and the promise of SAE Level 5 autonomous driving
      provided by Tesla and Waze. Aside from these shiny and visible applications
      of AI-ML are many other uses that are more subtle: AI-ML is now being used to
      screen job applicants as well as determine which web ads we are shown. And while
      many vendors of AI-ML technologies have promised that these tools provide for
      greater access and freedom from human prejudice, disabled users have found that
      these tools can embed and deploy newer, subtler forms of discrimination against
      disabled people. At their worst, AI-ML systems can deny disabled people their
      humanity. The explosion of AI-ML technologies in the last decade has been driven
      by at least three factors. First, the deep neural networks algorithms that currently
      drive much machine learning have been improved dramatically through the use
      of backpropagation [1], generative adversarial nets [2], and convolution [3],
      allowing for their deployment across a broad variety of datasets. Second, the
      cost of computing hardware (especially GPUs) has dropped dramatically while
      large scale cloud computing facilities and widespread fiber/ broadband/4G has
      provided for universal availability. Finally, large datasets have come online
      to aid in the training of the neural nets - for example, the image datasets
      provided through Google and Facebook, the large natural language datasets driving
      Amazon Alexa, and so forth. Deep neural networks themselves have two key features
      or flaws, depending on the perspective. First, they are highly dependent on
      the diversity of the training dataset used. Second, their internal operations
      when deployed are entirely opaque not only to the end-user but also to the designers
      of the system itself.", "venue": "International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on

      as the total probability of the elements that have not appeared or occurred
      in the sequence. The popular Good-Turing estimator for missing mass has been
      used extensively in language modeling and ecological studies. Exponential tail
      bounds have been known for missing mass, and improving them results in better
      confidence in estimation. In this work, we first show that missing mass is sub-Gamma
      on the right tail with the best-possible variance parameter under the Poisson
      and multinomial sampling models. This results in a right tail bound that beats
      the previously best known tail bound for deviation from mean up to about 0.2785.
      Further, we show that the sub-Gaussian approach cannot result in any improvement
      in the right tail bound for Poisson sampling. We derive confidence intervals
      for the Good-Turing estimator with better confidence levels and narrower width
      when compared to existing ones. Our results are worst case over all distributions.",

      of cognition in its myriad forms (Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive)
      displayed in all living beings (cellular organisms, animals, plants, and humans)
      and new theories of information, info-computation and knowledge are throwing
      light on how we should build software systems in the digital universe which
      mimic and interact with intelligent, sentient and resilient beings in the physical
      universe. Recent attempts to infuse cognition into computing systems to push
      the boundaries of Church-Turing thesis have led to new computing models that
      mimic biological systems in encoding knowledge structures using both algorithms
      executed in stored program control machines and neural networks. This paper
      presents a new model and implements an application as hierarchical named network
      composed of micro-services to create a managed process workflow by enabling
      dynamic configuration and reconfiguration of the micro-service network. We demonstrate
      the resiliency, efficiency and scaling of the named microservice network using
      a novel edge cloud platform by Platina Systems. The platform eliminates the
      need for Virtual Machine overlay and provides high performance and low-latency
      with L3 based 100 GbE network and SSD support with RDMA and NVMeoE. The hierarchical
      named microservice network using Kubernetes provisioning stack provides all
      the cloud features such as elasticity, auto-scaling, self-repair and live-migration
      without reboot. The model is derived from a recent theoretical framework for
      unification of different models of computation using \"Structural Machines.\"
      They are shown to simulate Turing machines, inductive Turing machines and also
      are proved to be more efficient than Turing machines. The structural machine
      framework with a hierarchy of controllers managing the named service connections
      provides dynamic reconfiguration of the service network from browsers to database
      to address rapid fluctuations in the demand for or the availability of resources

      "Church-Turing computability was extended by Brouwer who considered non-lawlike
      computability in the form of free choice sequences. Those are essentially unbounded
      sequences whose elements are chosen freely, i.e. not subject to any law. In
      this work we develop a new type theory BITT, which is an extension of the type
      theory of the Nuprl proof assistant, that embeds the notion of choice sequences.
      Supporting the evolving, non-deterministic nature of these objects required
      major modifications to the underlying type theory. Even though the construction
      of a choice sequence is non-deterministic, once certain choices were made, they
      must remain consistent. To ensure this, BITT uses the underlying library as
      state and store choices as they are created. Another salient feature of BITT
      is that it uses a Beth-like semantics to account for the dynamic nature of choice
      sequences. We formally define BITT and use it to interpret and validate essential
      axioms governing choice sequences. These results provide a foundation for a
      fully intuitionistic version of Nuprl.", "venue": "Logic in Computer Science",

      "title": "The non-cooperative tile assembly model is not intrinsically universal
      or capable of bounded Turing machine simulation", "abstract": "The field of
      algorithmic self-assembly is concerned with the computational and expressive
      power of nanoscale self-assembling molecular systems. In the well-studied cooperative,
      or temperature 2, abstract tile assembly model it is known that there is a tile
      set to simulate any Turing machine and an intrinsically universal tile set that
      simulates the shapes and dynamics of any instance of the model, up to spatial
      rescaling. It has been an open question as to whether the seemingly simpler
      noncooperative, or temperature 1, model is capable of such behaviour. Here we
      show that this is not the case by showing that there is no tile set in the noncooperative
      model that is intrinsically universal, nor one capable of time-bounded Turing
      machine simulation within a bounded region of the plane. Although the noncooperative
      model intuitively seems to lack the complexity and power of the cooperative
      model it has been exceedingly hard to prove this. One reason is that there have
      been few tools to analyse the structure of complicated paths in the plane. This
      paper provides a number of such tools. A second reason is that almost every
      obvious and small generalisation to the model (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square
      tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles that repel each other, parallel synchronous
      growth) endows it with great computational, and sometimes simulation, power.
      Our main results show that all of these generalisations provably increase computational
      and/or simulation power. Our results hold for both deterministic and nondeterministic
      noncooperative systems. Our first main result stands in stark contrast with
      the fact that for both the cooperative tile assembly model, and for 3D noncooperative
      tile assembly, there are respective intrinsically universal tilesets. Our second
      main result gives a new technique (reduction to simulation) for proving negative
      results about computation in tile assembly.", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory

      first case study, a computer infers the behavior of an agent while controlling

      for identifying security weaknesses, by conducting friendly attacks. Simulated
      pentesting automates this process, through designing a model of the system at

      should conduct its attacks the same way a real attacker would. Hence the ultimate
      goal is much more ambitious: to realistically simulate a human hacker. This
      is a grand vision indeed; e.g., the classical Turing Test can be viewed as a
      sub-problem. Taking a more practical perspective, the simulated pentesting model

      "An unsolved problem in neuroevolution (NE) is to evolve artificial neural networks

      plastic neural networks have shown promise in this context, they have difficulties
      retaining information over longer periods of time and integrating new information

      "Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning
      tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well. For example,
      add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly
      in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer,
      and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.
      \n \nWe describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators.
      For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following
      two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well
      as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to
      a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the
      best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but
      as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all
      symbols appearing the same number of times. \n \nSpecifically, for distributions
      over k symbols and n samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant
      of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of (3 + on(1))/n1/3
      from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within On(min(k/n,
      1/\u221an)). Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence
      at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/n2/3)) over the best estimator for the first comparison,
      and at least \u03a9n(min(k/n, 1/\u221an)) for the second.", "venue": "Neural

      in robotics and artificial intelligence, and increasing prevalence of commercial
      social robots and chatbots, humans are communicating with artificially intelligent
      machines for various applications in a wide range of settings. Intimate touch
      is crucial to relationships forming and emotional bonding, however it remains
      as a missing element in digital communication between humans, as well as humans
      and machines. A kissing machine, Kissenger, is built to transmit haptic kissing
      sensations in a communication network. In order to investigate the role of robotic
      kissing using the Kissenger device in digital communication, we conducted a
      modified version of the Imitation Game described by Alan Turing by including
      the use of the kissing machine. The study consists of 4 rounds, in which participants
      communicate with two players, a male and a female, using online chatrooms with
      the goal to identify the female player. In the last two rounds, the male player
      is replaced with a chatbot with female personas. Participants are told to remotely
      kiss the players using the kissing device at least once during the chat in the
      second and fourth round, but not in the first and third round. Results show
      that robotic kissing has no effect on the winning rates of the male and female
      players during human-human communication, but it increases the winning rate

      "Text-based Captchas have been widely used to deter misuse of services on the
      Internet. However, many designs have been broken. It is intellectually interesting
      and practically relevant to look for alternative designs, which are currently
      a topic of active research. We motivate the study of Chinese Captchas as an
      interesting alternative design - co-unterintuitively, it is possible to design
      Chinese Captchas that are universally usable, even to those who have never studied
      Chinese language. More importantly, we ask a fundamental question: is the segmentation-resistance
      principle established for Roman-character based Captchas applicable to Chinese
      based designs? With deep learning techniques, we offer the first evidence that
      computers do recognize individual Chinese characters well, regardless of distortion
      levels. This suggests that many real-world Chinese schemes are insecure, in
      contrast to common beliefs. Our result offers an essential guideline to the
      design of secure Chinese Captchas, and it is also applicable to Captchas using

      "title": "Characterizing the easy-to-find subgraphs from the viewpoint of polynomial-time
      algorithms, kernels, and Turing kernels", "abstract": "We study two fundamental
      problems related to finding subgraphs: (1) given graphs G and H, Subgraph Test
      asks if H is isomorphic to a subgraph of G, (2) given graphs G, H, and an integer
      t, Packing asks if G contains t vertex-disjoint subgraphs isomorphic to H. For
      every graph class F, let F-Subgraph Test and F-Packing be the special cases
      of the two problems where H is restricted to be in F. Our goal is to study which
      classes F make the two problems tractable in one of the following senses: \n
      \n\u2022 (randomized) polynomial-time solvable, \n \n\u2022 admits a polynomial
      (many-one) kernel (that is, has a polynomial-time preprocessing procedure that
      creates an equivalent instance whose size is polynomially bounded by the size
      of the solution), or \n \n\u2022 admits a polynomial Turing kernel (that is,
      has an adaptive polynomial-time procedure that reduces the problem to a polynomial
      number of instances, each of which has size bounded polynomially by the size
      of the solution). \n \nTo obtain a more robust setting, we restrict our attention
      to hereditary classes F. \n \nIt is known that if every component of every graph
      in F has at most two vertices, then F-Packing is polynomial-time solvable, and
      NP-hard otherwise. We identify a simple combinatorial property (every component
      of every graph in F either has bounded size or is a bipartite graph with one
      of the sides having bounded size) such that if a hereditary class F has this
      property, then F-Packing admits a polynomial kernel, and has no polynomial (many-one)
      kernel otherwise, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Furthermore, if
      F does not have this property, then F-Packing is either WK[1]-hard, W[1]-hard,
      or Long Path-hard, giving evidence that it does not admit polynomial Turing
      kernels either. \n \nFor F-Subgraph Test, we show that if every graph of a hereditary
      class F satisfies the property that it is possible to delete a bounded number
      of vertices such that every remaining component has size at most two, then F-Subgraph
      Test is solvable in randomized polynomial time and it is NP-hard otherwise.
      We introduce a combinatorial property called (a, b, c, d)-splittability and
      show that if every graph in a hereditary class F has this property, then F-Subgraph
      Test admits a polynomial Turing kernel and it is WK[1]-hard, W[1]-hard, or Long
      Path-hard otherwise. We do not give a complete characterization of the cases
      when F-Subgraph Test admits polynomial many-one kernels, but show examples that
      this question is much more fragile than the characterization for Turing kernels.",

      \n Bounded rationality aims to understand the effects of how limited rationality
      affects decision-making. The traditional models in game theory and multiagent
      system research, such as finite automata or unrestricted Turing machine, fall
      short of capturing how intelligent agents make decision in realistic applications.
      To address this problem, we model bounded rational agents as restricted Turing
      machines: restrictions on running time and on storage space. We study our model
      under the context of two-person repeated games. In the case where the running
      time of Turing machines is restricted, we show that computing the best response
      of a given strategy is much harder than the strategy itself. In the case where
      the storage space of the Turing machines is restricted, we show the best response
      of a space restricted strategy can not be implemented by machines within the
      same size (up to a constant factor). Finally, we study how these restrictions
      affect the set of Nash equilibria in infinitely repeated games.We show restricting
      the agent\u2019s computational resources will give rise to new Nash equilibria.\n

      science is towards Cloud Computing and we can see that many cloud services are
      proposed and developed in the Internet. An important cloud service like the
      IaaS as AWS EC2 can help many companies to build data centers with high performance
      computing resources and reduce the cost of maintaining the computing hardware.
      A data center which provides internet service may suffer from many security
      risks including Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack. We believe that
      most of the cloud services, like Gmail, Drop box, Google Document, and etc.,
      are based on HTTP connection. Hence, we aim at HTTP-based connection and propose
      a low reflection ratio mitigation system against the DDoS attacks. Our system
      is in the front of an IaaS that all of the virtual data centers in the IaaS
      are our protection targets. Our system consists of Source Checking, Counting,
      Attack Detection, Turing Test, and Question Generation modules. We provide a
      multi-stage detection to more precisely detect the possible attackers and a
      text-based turing test with question generation module to challenge the suspected
      requesters who are detected by the detection module. We implemented the proposed

      "abstract": "We prove that the Oritatami model of molecular folding is capable
      of embedding arbitrary computations in the folding process itself, by a local
      energy optimisation process, similar to how actual biomolecules such as DNA
      or RNA fold into complex shapes and functions. This result is the first principled
      construction in this research direction, and motivated the development of a
      generic toolbox, easily reusable in future work. One major challenge addressed
      by our design is that choosing the interactions to get the folding to react
      to its environment is NP-complete. Our techniques bypass this issue by allowing
      some flexibility in the shapes, which allows to encode different \" functions
      \" in different parts of the sequence (instead of using the same part of the
      sequence). However, the number of possible interactions between these functions
      remains quite large, and each interaction also involves a small combinatorial
      optimisation problem. One of the major challenges we faced was to decompose
      our programming into various levels of abstraction, allowing to prove their
      correctness thoroughly in a human readable/checkable form. We hope this framework
      can be generalised to other discrete dynamical systems, where proofs of such
      large objects are often difficult to get. l", "venue": "International Symposium

      and the relevance of the mirroring behavior as a humanness improvement factor
      is argued. The modules that compose MirrorBot''s architecture are presented
      along with a discussion of the advantages of this approach and proposed solutions

      popular tools for spreading spam and malware, Sybils (or fake accounts) pose

      Today, sophisticated attackers are creating realistic Sybils that effectively
      befriend legitimate users, rendering most automated Sybil detection techniques
      ineffective. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a crowdsourced Sybil
      detection system for OSNs. We conduct a large user study on the ability of humans
      to detect today''s Sybil accounts, using a large corpus of ground-truth Sybil
      accounts from the Facebook and Renren networks. We analyze detection accuracy
      by both \"experts\" and \"turkers\" under a variety of conditions, and find
      that while turkers vary significantly in their effectiveness, experts consistently
      produce near-optimal results. We use these results to drive the design of a
      multi-tier crowdsourcing Sybil detection system. Using our user study data,
      we show that this system is scalable, and can be highly effective either as
      a standalone system or as a complementary technique to current tools.", "venue":

      "title": "Feedback Turing Computability, and Turing Computability as Feedback",
      "abstract": "The notion of a feedback query is a natural generalization of choosing
      for an oracle the set of indices of halting computations. Notice that, in that
      setting, the computations being run are different from the computations in the
      oracle: the former can query an oracle, whereas the latter cannot. A feedback
      computation is one that can query an oracle, which itself contains the halting
      information about all feedback computations. Although this is self-referential,
      sense can be made of at least some such computations. This threatens, though,
      to obliterate the distinction between con- and divergence: before running a
      computation, a machine can ask the oracle whether that computation converges,
      and then run it if and only if the oracle says \"yes.\" This would quickly lead
      to a diagonalization paradox, except that a new distinction is introduced, this
      time between freezing and non-freezing computations. The freezing computations
      are even more extreme than the divergent ones, in that they prevent the dovetailing
      on all computations into a single run. In this paper, we study feedback around
      Turing computability. In one direction, we examine feedback Turing machines,
      and show that they provide exactly hyper arithmetic computability. In the other
      direction, Turing computability is itself feedback primitive recursion (at least,
      one version thereof). We also examine parallel feedback. Several different notions
      of parallelism in this context are identified. We show that parallel feedback
      Turing machines are strictly stronger than sequential feedback TMs, while in
      contrast parallel feedback p.r. Is the same as sequential feedback p.r.", "venue":

      argued that Turing, were he alive now, would conjecture differently than he
      did in 1950, and I suggested a new \"Turing challenge\" question, \"Is it imaginable
      that a computer (agent) team member could behave, over the long term and in
      uncertain, dynamic environments, in such a way that people on the team will
      not notice it is not human\". [4]. In the last several decades, the field of
      multi-agent systems has developed a vast array of techniques for cooperation
      and collaboration as well as for agents to handle adversarial or strategic situations.
      Even so, current generation agents are unlikely to meet this new challenge except
      in very simple situations. The need for agents to work better with people has
      become greater and more widespread, as evidenced by the Human-Agent Interaction
      Design and Models Workshop at this conference and an upcoming conference on
      Human Computation and Crowdsourcing. Research in these arenas approaches human-computer
      collaborations from different perspectives, but shares many challenges. Meeting
      these challenges requires new algorithms and novel plan representations. This
      talk will explore the implications of this new \"Turing question\" and examine
      several challenges that arise in the design both of agents supporting people
      and of systems in which people assist computers in their work. These challenges
      include determining a division of labor that respects the complementary strengths
      of people and computer agents, development of methods for information sharing,
      defining incentive mechanisms for such settings, and designing empirical methodologies
      for evaluating agents in open mixed networks [3]. I will describe recent work
      by my group on interruption management, plan recognition, and test-beds for
      empirical studies of human-computer collaborations aimed at addressing these
      challenges, and will discuss our current work on developing intelligent agents
      able to work as a team supporting health care providers and patients to improve
      care coordination and in the communication of medical information.", "venue":

      to non-Turing optical computer to solve NP-complete problems. A proof-of-principle
      demonstration of solving directed Hamiltonian path problem was performed on

      the existence of Hamiltonian path can be made by monitoring the delayed output
      pulses from the fiber network where a positive answer means a pulse appearing
      at the delay equal to the total delay of the whole graph. The decision was successfully

      in fiber and minimum 10 photons for a reliable detection, we argue that current
      fiber technology shall allow interrogating graphs with up to a few hundred nodes.
      Moreover, it is known that all the NP-complete problems can be transferred to
      each other with a polynomial complete reduction, meaning that this optical computer

      "The computational power of recurrent neural networks is intimately related
      to the nature of their synaptic weights. In particular, neural networks with
      static rational weights are known to be Turing equivalent, and recurrent networks
      with static real weights were proved to be super-Turing. Here, we study the
      computational power of a more biologically-oriented model where the synaptic
      weights can evolve rather than stay static. We prove that such evolving networks
      gain a super-Turing computational power, equivalent to that of static real-weighted
      networks, regardless of whether their synaptic weights are rational or real.
      These results suggest that evolution might play a crucial role in the computational
      capabilities of neural networks.", "venue": "The 2011 International Joint Conference

      "To an outsider it may appear as though an individual with aphasia has poor
      cognitive function. However, the problem resides in the individual''s receptive
      and expressive language, and not in their ability to think. This misperception,
      paired with a lack of empathy, can have a direct impact on quality of life and
      medical care. Hailpern''s 2011 paper on ACES demonstrated a novel system that
      enabled users (e.g., caregivers, therapists, family) to experience first hand
      the communication-distorting effects of aphasia. While their paper illustrated
      the impact of ACES on empathy, it did not validate the underlying distortion
      emulation. This paper provides a validation of ACES'' distortions through a
      Turing Test experiment with participants from the Speech and Hearing Science
      community. It illustrates that text samples generated with ACES distortions
      are generally not distinguishable from text samples originating from individuals
      with aphasia. This paper explores ACES distortions through a `How Human'' is

      find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative models, our primary
      goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data, nor
      do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using
      our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification
      on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed
      by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot
      distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate
      of 21.3%. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and
      show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet

      "title": "Pointer Networks", "abstract": "We introduce a new neural architecture
      to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that
      are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems
      cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence
      [1] and Neural Turing Machines [2], because the number of target classes in
      each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable.
      Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial
      optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of
      variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural
      attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead
      of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at
      each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the
      input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net).
      We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging
      geometric problems - finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations,
      and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem - using training examples alone.
      Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but
      also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that
      the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on.
      We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural
      learning for discrete problems.", "venue": "Neural Information Processing Systems",

      The Universal Turing Machine (UTM) or simply a universal machine is a solution
      to this problem. A UTM simulates any other TM, thus providing a single model
      and solution for all the computational problems. The creation of UTM is very

      do not support the creation of UTM which makes the task very difficult to accomplish.
