      Our present interest is not in the low fertility of powerful but numerically

      Today, residents of urban communities constitute more than one half, and the
      white-collar classes perhaps one quarter of the total population. These groups
      are not sufficiently fertile to replace their own numbers. They are being recruited

      essential to secure and to maintain pure cultures of the fungi being investigated.
      Yet in many cases, cultures of the fungi, free from bacteria, are extremely
      difficult to obtain. This preliminary step in an investigation is often tedious
      and disproportionately time-consuming and hence the major objective of one''s
      research is often long delayed. The Saprolegniaceae, as a group, are especially
      troublesome to isolate. This difficulty arises because of the following conditions:
      these fungi occur in nature accompanied by large numbers of bacteria; usually
      the fungi themselves are slower in growing than the bacteria; the fungi, when
      grown on agar, are surrounded by a liquid film, by means of which the bacteria
      readily accompany the hyphae; the fungi do not grow satisfactorily in the presence
      of the commonly used bacterial inhibitors; the fungi have temperature and water
      requirements similar to those of bacteria. Each of these conditions adds to
      the difficulty of isolation by the common method of repeated transfer, since
      the hyphae invariably are ac? companied by adhering bacteria. The methods which
      have been employed in obtaining pure cul? tures of the Saprolegniaceae were
      ably reviewed by Kauffman (4). These methods as well as those more recently
      developed not only for the Saprolegniaceae but also for other fungi, may be
      roughly classified as either mechanical or chemical.", "venue": "", "year":

      for which he was treated for six weeks in a hospital in Hamburg, seemingly,
      according to several afterexaminations, with good result. He has lived for four
      years in South America, and while there repeatedly had malaria, the last time
      in 1930. In that year he also had dysentery. For some months past he has been
      an inmate of an asylum for inebriates, from which he was admitted to the medical
      department of the Diacons'' Home with a transfer diagnosis of lumbago. The part
      of the anamnesis which refers to his bone disease was brought out only in answer
      to direct questioning after roentgenography had revealed the condition. This
      shows how little it had troubled him. For the last ten years he has had the
      feeling that his right leg was becoming shorter than its fellow, because it
      did not reach the ground when he stood upright. For seven to ten years it has
      felt heavier than the left, from the hip downward, and has caused him a feeling
      of tiredness, which would become painful on any severe effort. This pain caused
      him to notice a thickening above the ankle. Otherwise the anamnesis contains
      nothing of interest. His natural functions are in good order. Examination on
      entry, 23rd Oct., 1934. \u2014 The patient is stoutish, his face somewhat bloodshot.
      He admits that he has been drinking a good deal, but denies being an alcoholist.
      The usual physical examina\u00ad tion showed normal conditions. Urine, normal.
      Blood pressure, 130/75. Pulse, 68. During his stay in the hospital the variations
      in his tempera\u00ad ture were rather considerable: morning, 36.3\u00b0\u201436.5\u00b0;

      "abstract": "Contrary to the belief held by many persons, index numbers are
      not re stricted to the realm of general econom ics, but are serviceable in many
      fields, and are equally well adapted to problems which do not directly involve
      money in any way. Index numbers have received a wider use in the field of education
      than is generally recognized. Perhaps their varied use in educational problems
      is not better known because they have not been expressly treated in educational
      litera ture as a technique of general applica bility. The procedure has been
      borrowed from economic3 and applied to education al problems by individual workers
      with out attention having been called explicit ly to the nature of the adaptations
      that have been made, and to the possibilities of further use, both for immediate
      serv ice and for research. It is the purpose of this article to make a beginning
      in this direction. It will discuss some of the general characteristics of index
      num bers, ^ and refer to the uses that have been made of them in education.
      The index number technique af fords an important means of indexing (measuring)
      complex variation. It is especially adapted to measuring changes in phenomena
      which cannot be objectively identified except in terms of several component
      or resultant elements. To take a common example, the concept, \"cost of living\",
      is an abstraction which does not exist as a concrete en tity, and cannot be
      dealt with directly as a single object. Its status depends upon the many variable
      elements which compose it. The same thing is true with regard to many of our
      concepts of quali ties or properties of logically complex phenomena?i.e., those
      which comprise a number of different kinds of elements. If one desires to measure
      such a character as \"cost of living\", or \"size\" of school systems, or \"general
      goodness\" of school systems, one theoretically has four courses open to him:
      (l) he can rely on a single selected characteristic which can be directly measured
      or count ed, to represent the general character;", "venue": "", "year": 1936,

      INSULATED AND AN UNINSULATED OPEN\u2010HEARTH FURNACE ROOF*", "abstract": "Measurements
      of the linear thermal expansion of different zones in the used silica roof brick
      whose composition and structure have been described by Harvey show that along
      the length of the brick there are two abrupt changes in expansion. The first,
      whose existence was predicted by Harvey and by Miller, coincides with the limit
      of penetration of iron oxide and arises from the fact that in the presence of
      iron oxide the silica, originally present as cristobalite, has been largely
      converted to tridymite, which has a different expansion. The limit of penetration
      of iron oxide is taken as that level at which the average temperature is 1100\u00b0C
      (2010\u00b0F), the temperature of the ternary eutectic in the system CaO-FeO-SiO2;
      consequently, the abrupt change in expansion, and therefore a zone of weakness,
      is to be expected after equilibrium has been established in any open-hearth
      roof brick whose cold end is below 1100\u00b0C (2010\u00b0F). The second change,
      which is also due to a discontinuity in the distribution of cristobalite, occurs
      at that level in the brick at which the average temperature was 1470\u00b0C
      (2080\u00b0F), the lower limit of the stable range for cristobalite. In each
      case the change in expansion arises directly from a difference in the length-change
      at the cristobalite inversion, which takes place at approximately 250\u00b0C
      (480\u00b0F), so that failure or spalling is most likely to occur when the roof
      is cooled below or heated through this temperature. The expansion data also
      show that the inversion temperature of cristobalite increases regularly with
      the temperature at which it was formed or at which it was brought to equilibrium.
      \n \nThe data obtained enable the determination of the average distribution
      of tempera ture through the brick in service, which, combined with existing
      data on thermal conductivity of silica brick, permits an estimation of the mean
      thermal conductivity of that part of the brick into which iron oxide has penetrated.
      This conductivity is greater than that of the rest of the brick and has a negative
      temperature coefficient in contrast to the positive coefficient for the unaltered
      part.", "venue": "", "year": 1936, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1,

      "title": "Local Growth Disturbances in Tuberculous Disease of the Knee-Joint
      in Children", "abstract": "Where a chronic state of irritation, in the form
      of an infectious pro\u00ad cess, exists about a growing joint with its ossifie
      centres and epiphyseal lines, one may often observe an excessive development
      at those centres of growth. As its clinical expression one finds in the growing
      child a meas\u00ad urably greater length on the diseased side than on the other.
      In connexion with tuberculosis of the knee-joint this has been briefly noted
      by SORELD E J E R I N E and SINDING-LARSEN, but in general no notice is taken
      of the symptom, not even in large clinical works. In the roentgenologic litera\u00ad
      ture equally little attention has been paid to it. I t is true that in 1916
      FORSSELL, in a paper on tuberculosis of joints, illustrated the subject by an
      example (the case was of a wrist) and mentioned HAUDEK''S earlier at\u00ad tempts
      to utilise the growth disturbances about the diseased articulation as a means
      of diagnosis; but since then these phenomena have, as far as I can find, been
      almost entirely overlooked, even in otherwise important works on the clinic
      and roentgenology of the knee-joint. Considering the insufficiency of our other
      aids to diagnosis of knee-joint diseases \u2014 a matter particularly commented
      on at the Congress of Surgery in Copen\u00ad hagen, in 1935 \u2014 I believe
      there is every reason to take HAUDEK''S old idea up again, and to give a concise
      representation of the growth disturb\u00ad ances in tuberculosis of the knee-joint
      in children. I t has been found that the knee-joint is the articulation in which
      phe\u00ad nomena of this order can best be demonstrated and registered. In the
      first place, already the normal rate of growth is greatest there, in the sec\u00ad

      decisions of this character will eventually become matters for social consideration.
      The New State of the future will need social technicians who will be asked to
      engage in cultural planning just as technological experts and economists will
      be called upon to plan for orderly material production and distribution. Those
      who have exercised a similar function during the individualist-competitive phase
      of modern economy have been to a very large extent, associated with foundations
      and trusts. Consequently it becomes pertinent to discover how these culture

      the second part of the book, aside from such inadequacies, gives a very good
      idea of its importance from Roman times to our own. The third part of the book,
      entitled &dquo;The Nature of Law,&dquo; is a brief review of some modern theories
      and approaches. If, in light of its purely introductory character, anything
      should be said, it is perhaps to the point that the author, in discussing the
      rational process of lawmaking, has not clearly indicated the extent to which
      the development of law in modern times has been a rationalization of things
      accomplished in the social and economic fields. Specifically, the claim so often
      made that the laws of England and America have safeguarded personal and property
      rights is farfetched. A critical analysis would indicate that personal liberty
      and property rights were rather outgrowths of the struggle for the free market.
      In fact, in the light of the modern wage slavery, the emphasis in English and
      American theory on rights in the abstract is to all intents and purposes an
      absurdity, which the author fails to see. It is difficult to understand why
      a clearer critique of this position has been omitted. To the layman reading
      the book, the defects in evaluation, emphasis, and interpretation are unimportant
      when set alongside of its rational message and clarity of expression. To the
      college student, the book is a valuable general treatment of the field if in

      bridges were framed and erected by a county bridge crew working under the supervision
      of the county surveyor, who also served as a highway supervisor. The bridge
      crew consisted of a foreman, a carpenter, a truck driver, and from one to three
      common laborers. They removed the old struc\u00ad ture, constructed the new
      one, and made all approach fills necessary to complete the structure in from
      two to five days time, the time depending on the size of the structure. I-beams
      were used for stringers on all structures having a span of fourteen feet or
      over, and the three-inch flooring was fastened to the I-beams with cleats which
      locked the in\u00ad dividual planks to the stringers and to each other. The
      road\u00ad way was determined by the type of road on which the struc\u00ad ture
      was built, and all structures on improved roads or roads which would be improved
      soon were constructed with not less than eighteen feet of roadway. These structures
      have proved very satisfactory and the construction of similar ones will be continued
      in the future. Their life is estimated, on the basis of the life of several
      old structures in the county, at a minimum of fifteen years when native oak
      lumber treated with creosote as described in this article is used. Many of the
