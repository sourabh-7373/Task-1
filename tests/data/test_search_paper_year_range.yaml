      (the \"Rumpfsystem\") each of which makes a certain assertion with regard to
      the funda mental concepts employed, appears a final axiom seemingly concerning
      the preceding axioms and not related to the fundamental concepts of the system.
      The best known such axiom-system is that of Hilbert for Euclidean geometry,
      with its famous \"Axiom of Completeness.\" Whether the final axiom states that
      no more inclusive system of things exists which satisfies the preceding\u2014and
      is therefore a \"maximal\" axiom\u2014or is analogously a \"minimal\" axiom,
      such a final axiom will be called an \"extremal\" axiom. The authors defend
      the use of such axioms under suitable restrictions and when properly stated
      and interpreted. A fundamental concept in the study of axiomatics is the notion
      of isomorphism which the authors extend, by the concept of correlators which
      are binary relations between given n-ary relations. Complete isomorphism is
      discussed with respect to types of like speci fied order. If any two structures
      satisfying the \"Rumpfsystem\" are completely isomorphic as to elements of specified
      order, one may then inquire as to whether such a structure does or does not
      have a proper substructure isomorphic with it. Distinction is made between extensions
      of model and ex tension of structure. The legitimate introduction of the extremal
      axiom corresponds to the selection of extremal structures. The question of independence
      of the axioms in the \"Rumpfsystem\" as affected by the introduction of an extremal
      postulate is discussed and various cases are found to occur. A final serious
      question arises with regard to extension to a system of different order-type,
      as occurs from the system of rational numbers to that of real numbers regarded
      as sequences of rationals. Tarski''s restriction to an increase of one unit
      in order type has many attractive features, and avoids certain serious difficulties,
      but is found to be somewhat too restrictive.", "venue": "Journal of Symbolic

      have been given to express an exact meaning corresponding to the intuitive idea
      of \u2018effective calculability\u2019 as applied for instance to functions
      of positive integers. The purpose of the present paper is to show that the computable
      functions introduced by the author are identical with the \u03bb-definable functions
      of Church and the general recursive functions due to Herbrand and G\u00f6del
      and developed by Kleene. It is shown that every \u03bb-definable function is
      computable and that every computable function is general recursive. There is
      a modified form of \u03bb-definability, known as \u03bb-K-definability, and
      it turns out to be natural to put the proof that every \u03bb-definable function
      is computable in the form of a proof that every \u03bb-K-definable function
      is computable; that every \u03bb-definable function is \u03bb-K-definable is
      trivial. If these results are taken in conjunction with an already available
      proof that every general recursive function is \u03bb-definable we shall have
      the required equivalence of computability with \u03bb-definability and incidentally
      a new proof of the equivalence of \u03bb-definability and \u03bb-K-definability.
      A definition of what is meant by a computable function cannot be given satisfactorily
      in a short space. I therefore refer the reader to Computable pp. 230\u2013235

      of conversion it is important to have a formally defined function which assigns
      to any positive integer n the least integer not less than n which has a given
      property. The definition of such a formula is somewhat involved: I propose to
      give the corresponding formula in \u03bb-K-conversion, which will (naturally)
      be much simpler. I shall in fact find a formula \u00fe such that if T be a formula
      for which T(n) is convertible to a formula representing a natural number, whenever
      n represents a natural number, then \u00fe(T, r) is convertible to the formula
      q representing the least natural number q, not less than r, for which T(q) conv
      0.2 The method depends on finding a formula \u0398 with the property that \u0398
      conv \u03bbu\u00b7u(\u0398(u)), and consequently if M\u2192\u0398(V) then M
      conv V(M). A formula with this property is, The formula \u00fe will have the

      can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine. I t is thus immediately clear that
      computability, so defined, can be identified with (especially, is no less general
      than) the notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain mathematical problems
      (various forms of the Entscheidungsproblem, various problems to find complete
      sets of invariants in topology, group theory, etc., and in general any problem
      which concerns the discovery of an algorithm). The principal result is that
      there exist sequences (well-defined on classical grounds) which are not computable.
      In particular the deducibility problem of the functional calculus of first order
      (Hilbert and Ackermann''s engere Funktionenkalkiil) is unsolvable in the sense
      that, if the formulas of this calculus are enumerated in a straightforward manner,
      the sequence whose nth term is 0 or 1, according as the nth formula in the enumeration
      is or is not deducible, is not computable. (The proof here requires some correction
      in matters of detail.) In an appendix the author sketches a proof of equivalence
      of \"computability\" in his sense and \"effective calculability\" in the sense
      of the present reviewer {American journal of mathematics, vol. 58 (1936), pp.
      345-363, see review in this JOURNAL, vol. 1, pp. 73-74). The author''s result
      concerning the existence of uncomputable sequences was also anticipated, in
      terms of effective calculability, in the cited paper. His work was, however,
      done independently, being nearly complete and known in substance to a number
      of persons at the time that the paper appeared. As a matter of fact, there is
      involved here the equivalence of three different notions: computability by a
      Turing machine, general recursiveness in the sense of Herbrand-Godel-Kleene,
      and X-definability in the sense of Kleene and the present reviewer. Of these,
      the first has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness

      as a kind of Turing machine. I t is thus immediately clear that computability,
      so defined, can be identified with (especially, is no less general than) the
      notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain mathematical problems (various
      forms of the Entscheidungsproblem, various problems to find complete sets of
      invariants in topology, group theory, etc., and in general any problem which
      concerns the discovery of an algorithm). The principal result is that there
      exist sequences (well-defined on classical grounds) which are not computable.
      In particular the deducibility problem of the functional calculus of first order
      (Hilbert and Ackermann''s engere Funktionenkalkiil) is unsolvable in the sense
      that, if the formulas of this calculus are enumerated in a straightforward manner,
      the sequence whose nth term is 0 or 1, according as the nth formula in the enumeration
      is or is not deducible, is not computable. (The proof here requires some correction
      in matters of detail.) In an appendix the author sketches a proof of equivalence
      of \"computability\" in his sense and \"effective calculability\" in the sense
      of the present reviewer {American journal of mathematics, vol. 58 (1936), pp.
      345-363, see review in this JOURNAL, vol. 1, pp. 73-74). The author''s result
      concerning the existence of uncomputable sequences was also anticipated, in
      terms of effective calculability, in the cited paper. His work was, however,
      done independently, being nearly complete and known in substance to a number
      of persons at the time that the paper appeared. As a matter of fact, there is
      involved here the equivalence of three different notions: computability by a
      Turing machine, general recursiveness in the sense of Herbrand-Godel-Kleene,
      and X-definability in the sense of Kleene and the present reviewer. Of these,
      the first has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness
      in the ordinary (not explicitly defined) sense evident immediately\u2014i.e.

      Yet in many cases, cultures of the fungi, free from bacteria, are extremely
      difficult to obtain. This preliminary step in an investigation is often tedious
      and disproportionately time-consuming and hence the major objective of one''s
      research is often long delayed. The Saprolegniaceae, as a group, are especially
      troublesome to isolate. This difficulty arises because of the following conditions:
      these fungi occur in nature accompanied by large numbers of bacteria; usually
      the fungi themselves are slower in growing than the bacteria; the fungi, when
      grown on agar, are surrounded by a liquid film, by means of which the bacteria
      readily accompany the hyphae; the fungi do not grow satisfactorily in the presence
      of the commonly used bacterial inhibitors; the fungi have temperature and water
      requirements similar to those of bacteria. Each of these conditions adds to
      the difficulty of isolation by the common method of repeated transfer, since
      the hyphae invariably are ac? companied by adhering bacteria. The methods which
      have been employed in obtaining pure cul? tures of the Saprolegniaceae were
      ably reviewed by Kauffman (4). These methods as well as those more recently

      "ture on the absorption spectrum will not be so great as at the lower pressure
      of the emission layer. We may assume curve (c) of figure 4 to represent with
      sufficient accuracy the radiation coming to the surface from a cold atmosphere,
      but not the radiation leaving the atmosphere a t high levels. From observations
      of polar continental air at low temperatures, it becomes possible to place an
      upper limit on the amount of radiation that leaves the atmosphere by way of
      the emission layer. A surface temperature of -60'' C., which has commonly been
      observed in Alaska and Siberia, corresponds to an equilibrium temperature of
      -34'' C. for the isothernial layer above it.\" From the difference between curves
      (a) and (c) of figure 4, the net loss of radiation to space froni the surface
      is found to be 0.054 gni cal/cm2/niin. The loss to space from the emission layer
      must not exceed this amount, for otherwise the atmosphere could not cool and
      at the same time preserve a stable lapse rate in lower levels. An even lower
      limit can be placed on the radiation if we notice that the isothermal layer
      in sounding (a), figure 1, of the writer''s previous paper, ha.s a temperature
      of -41'' C., corresponding to an equilibrium surface temperature of -66'' C.
      In this case the net loss of ra.diation froni the surface is 0.044 gm cnl/cm2/min.,
      which is mi upper limit to the loss of radiation from the emission layer. In
      conclusion, it therefore appears t,lia,t model B is more sa tisfactory for computations
      which involve atniospheiic radiation thsn is model A. Furthermore, the nieasureinents
      of Weber and Randall, and the effects of low tempera.ture a.nd pressure on absorption,
      together inchate that the atniosphe,re is more t,ranspa.rent t80 long-wave radia.tion

      "title": "A System for Correlation of Land Forms and Covers with Soil Classification",
      "abstract": "This country is most fortunate, in having an established scheme
      of soil classification which has been in effect and has been applied on actual
      surveys throughout all parts of the country during a considerable number of
      years. It is also fortunate in that the scheme is flexible and applicable to
      all degrees of detail and to all scales of field mapping. It is but logical,
      therefore, that this system of soil classification should be incorporated in
      any scheme for evaluating the dominant factors which affect land use, whether
      for purposes of land classification or for the direct utilitarian purpose of
      developing soil conservation measures. When the Soil Erosion Service (later
      the Soil Conservation Service) launched the first soil conservation projects,
      it was necessary to establish principles and to develop procedures to attain
      the desired objectives. At the very outset, it was adopted as a cardinal principle
      of the organization that soil conservation plans should be predicated upon an
      inventory of those factors which are of dominant importance in land use. Since
      these conservation plans had to be made for each field of each farm within the
      project area and had to conform to variations in conditions which \u2022would
      affect the conservation plans even within a field, it was essential that the
      inventory of the dominant factors affecting conservation be shown in place on
      a detailed map of each farm. Thus, each area delineated on the farm maps, whether
      an entire field or parts of a field, received an evaluation of each of the four
      factors shown by the survey. While the immediate objective of the survey was
      directly utilitarian in that soil conservation plans were developed at once
      for each farm in accordance with the findings of the survey, the surveys furnished
      also a valuable accumulation of data which were rendered more valuable for analyses
      of the physical factors, influencing land use because they were shown in detail
      and in place. Thus, when the survey of any project area \u00b1s completed, whether
      25,000 or 200,000 ''acres, the conditions of any one factor can be summarized
      for the area as a whole, or can be analyzed in relationship to each other, or
      to all other factors. The analyses of these conditions can in turn be correlated
      with farm management surveys or other farm studies. The factors which are considered
      to be of dominant''importance in soil conservation, and hence, the ones shown
      by the inventory, listed in the order in which they will be discussed hereafter,
      are four in number, as follows: (l) soil type; (2) present land use or ground
      cover; (3) slope; and (4) character and degree of erosion. Since these four
      factors are shown for each field, and usually for different parts of one field,
      it is necessary to delineate upon a large-scale map, each field and each area
      within which any one of the four factors varies. This entails the construction
      of large-scale accurate base maps. It has been found that the most satisfactory
      base maps upon which to show all of the detail desired are aerial survey pic\u2014
      tures, particularly since recent photographs show much of the information desired,
      such as cover, drainage, roads, buildings, fences fences, gullies, and, to a
      certain extent, other erosion conditions, such as severe sheet or wind erosion.
      There has been marked development in aerial''photography in the last few years.
      Mr. Marshall Wright, in charge of Cartography in the Soil Conservation Service,
      has delivered a paper here, telling of the progress made in that field. Costs
      have been reduced materially, and the", "venue": "", "year": 1937, "referenceCount":

      "abstract": "Contrary to the belief held by many persons, index numbers are
      not re stricted to the realm of general econom ics, but are serviceable in many
      fields, and are equally well adapted to problems which do not directly involve
      money in any way. Index numbers have received a wider use in the field of education
      than is generally recognized. Perhaps their varied use in educational problems
      is not better known because they have not been expressly treated in educational
      litera ture as a technique of general applica bility. The procedure has been
      borrowed from economic3 and applied to education al problems by individual workers
      with out attention having been called explicit ly to the nature of the adaptations
      that have been made, and to the possibilities of further use, both for immediate
      serv ice and for research. It is the purpose of this article to make a beginning
      in this direction. It will discuss some of the general characteristics of index
      num bers, ^ and refer to the uses that have been made of them in education.
      The index number technique af fords an important means of indexing (measuring)
      complex variation. It is especially adapted to measuring changes in phenomena
      which cannot be objectively identified except in terms of several component
      or resultant elements. To take a common example, the concept, \"cost of living\",
      is an abstraction which does not exist as a concrete en tity, and cannot be
      dealt with directly as a single object. Its status depends upon the many variable
      elements which compose it. The same thing is true with regard to many of our
      concepts of quali ties or properties of logically complex phenomena?i.e., those
      which comprise a number of different kinds of elements. If one desires to measure
      such a character as \"cost of living\", or \"size\" of school systems, or \"general
      goodness\" of school systems, one theoretically has four courses open to him:
      (l) he can rely on a single selected characteristic which can be directly measured
      or count ed, to represent the general character;", "venue": "", "year": 1936,

      temperature regulat-ing mechanism, as that of the central nature, such as is
      elicitable by warming the carotid arteries. By raising the environmental temperature,
      the dog, without nar-cotizing, reacted by heat-tachypnoea; at its onset the
      body tempera-ture was usually normal or a little decreased, or only slightly
      raised, as well known. The corpus striatum, the thalamus opticus, and the tuber
      cine-rum were removed; no narcosis was used, and about one hour was. allowed
      to elapse before the next warming experiment for recovery from the operative
      shock. Afterwards no heat-tachypnoea of the reflex nature was elicited. contrary
      to that of the central origin. Some acceleration in the re-spiratory rate was
      always preceded by a material rise of the body temperature; that is, there was
      no evidence of heat-tachypnoea of the reflex nature occurring. In the majority
      of cases where some considerable tachypnoea, such as 90-200 breathing per min.,
      appeared after the brain opera-tion on raising the environmental temperature
      or on warming the -carotid arteries (S ato and Nemoto), whereby the body temperature
      was raised, the brain lesion was identical in essential points to that causable
      by the decerebration of Sherrington. This shows: So far as the midbrain remains
      nearly intact or even if the anterior col-liculi be excluded, although the brain
      portions anteriorto it be wholly removed or destroyed, the heat-tachypn oea
      is capable of being brought about by raising the temperature thereof or the
      body temperature. From the above outcome it may be justifiable to conclude:
      (1) The central mechanism for regulating the body temperature is indispensable
      for causing the heat-tachypnoea of the reflex origin. (2) The heat-tachypnoea
      of the central origin is induciable if the brain anterior to the midbrain or
      even the anterior colliculi are excluded.", "venue": "", "year": 1937, "referenceCount":

      the second part of the book, aside from such inadequacies, gives a very good
      idea of its importance from Roman times to our own. The third part of the book,
      entitled &dquo;The Nature of Law,&dquo; is a brief review of some modern theories
      and approaches. If, in light of its purely introductory character, anything
      should be said, it is perhaps to the point that the author, in discussing the
      rational process of lawmaking, has not clearly indicated the extent to which
      the development of law in modern times has been a rationalization of things
      accomplished in the social and economic fields. Specifically, the claim so often
      made that the laws of England and America have safeguarded personal and property
      rights is farfetched. A critical analysis would indicate that personal liberty
      and property rights were rather outgrowths of the struggle for the free market.
      In fact, in the light of the modern wage slavery, the emphasis in English and
      American theory on rights in the abstract is to all intents and purposes an
      absurdity, which the author fails to see. It is difficult to understand why

      "The writer''s interest in children''s litera ture, particularly in its relation
      to character education, led to an attempt to consider the value of the fable
      as an aid toward the devel opment of character. It seemed probable that experimentation
      would show something of the degree to which children might be influenced toward
      choosing correct alternatives in life situations through suggestions emanating
      di rectly or indirectly from literature. In order that the experiment could
      be resolved in fairly precise terms, an effort was made to arrive at a measure
      of accuracy in determin ing the influence of the fable (as taught in elementary
      schools) on the child''s moral judgment. Such a study seemed to answer a definite
      need in present-day character education, par ticularly since the fable was not
      only found to be included in the Syllabus of the New York City Board of Education
      from the sec ond through the fourth grades, but also ap peared in the Syllabi
      of elementary school systems in many other American cities. So far as could
      be ascertained, no study of the possible scope and influence of the fable on
      character education has been made. Apart from a validation of the fable''s worth
      as an instrument of character education, the consid eration of the proper methods
      of presenting the fable for this purpose seemed important.", "venue": "", "year":

      few prices from the Baltimore and New York markets in order to make some series
      complete. As explained in an admirable appendix on method, the interpolations
      have been made with extreme care. In interpreting their results the authors
      have avoided preconceived theories, contenting themselves with a detailed objective
      description of the price structure and changes within it, as revealed by the
      analysis of quantitative data. As in the earlier volume, they have bolstered
      their statistical interpretation by the comments of contemporary merchants and
      current market reports-a procedure which gives flavor to what is otherwise inevitably
      a dry, though rich, historical repast. Many readers will regret the failure
      to relate price fluctuations to monetary changes. The authors seem to the reviewer
      to have missed an opportunity by not discussing how far their results support
      or disprove the idea of major rhythms or secular trends discerned by Feder and
      formulated by Kondratieff. But of those who have done so much, we must not make
      excessive demands. The amount of sheer hard work involved in this study is staggering

      in Children", "abstract": "Where a chronic state of irritation, in the form
      of an infectious pro\u00ad cess, exists about a growing joint with its ossifie
      centres and epiphyseal lines, one may often observe an excessive development
      at those centres of growth. As its clinical expression one finds in the growing
      child a meas\u00ad urably greater length on the diseased side than on the other.
      In connexion with tuberculosis of the knee-joint this has been briefly noted
      by SORELD E J E R I N E and SINDING-LARSEN, but in general no notice is taken
      of the symptom, not even in large clinical works. In the roentgenologic litera\u00ad
      ture equally little attention has been paid to it. I t is true that in 1916
      FORSSELL, in a paper on tuberculosis of joints, illustrated the subject by an
      example (the case was of a wrist) and mentioned HAUDEK''S earlier at\u00ad tempts
      to utilise the growth disturbances about the diseased articulation as a means
      of diagnosis; but since then these phenomena have, as far as I can find, been
      almost entirely overlooked, even in otherwise important works on the clinic
      and roentgenology of the knee-joint. Considering the insufficiency of our other
      aids to diagnosis of knee-joint diseases \u2014 a matter particularly commented
      on at the Congress of Surgery in Copen\u00ad hagen, in 1935 \u2014 I believe
      there is every reason to take HAUDEK''S old idea up again, and to give a concise
      representation of the growth disturb\u00ad ances in tuberculosis of the knee-joint
      in children. I t has been found that the knee-joint is the articulation in which
      phe\u00ad nomena of this order can best be demonstrated and registered. In the
      first place, already the normal rate of growth is greatest there, in the sec\u00ad
      ond place the acceleration of the growth is seemingly proportional to the normal
      growth in the epiphyseal lines. Furthermore the earliest symp\u00ad toms, according
      to SVEN JOHANSSON''S investigations, most often occur in", "venue": "", "year":

      "title": "A COMPARISON OF THE THERMAL EXPANSION OF USED SILICA BRICK FROM AN
      INSULATED AND AN UNINSULATED OPEN\u2010HEARTH FURNACE ROOF*", "abstract": "Measurements
      of the linear thermal expansion of different zones in the used silica roof brick
      whose composition and structure have been described by Harvey show that along
      the length of the brick there are two abrupt changes in expansion. The first,
      whose existence was predicted by Harvey and by Miller, coincides with the limit
      of penetration of iron oxide and arises from the fact that in the presence of
      iron oxide the silica, originally present as cristobalite, has been largely
      converted to tridymite, which has a different expansion. The limit of penetration
      of iron oxide is taken as that level at which the average temperature is 1100\u00b0C
      (2010\u00b0F), the temperature of the ternary eutectic in the system CaO-FeO-SiO2;
      consequently, the abrupt change in expansion, and therefore a zone of weakness,
      is to be expected after equilibrium has been established in any open-hearth
      roof brick whose cold end is below 1100\u00b0C (2010\u00b0F). The second change,
      which is also due to a discontinuity in the distribution of cristobalite, occurs
      at that level in the brick at which the average temperature was 1470\u00b0C
      (2080\u00b0F), the lower limit of the stable range for cristobalite. In each
      case the change in expansion arises directly from a difference in the length-change
      at the cristobalite inversion, which takes place at approximately 250\u00b0C
      (480\u00b0F), so that failure or spalling is most likely to occur when the roof
      is cooled below or heated through this temperature. The expansion data also
      show that the inversion temperature of cristobalite increases regularly with
      the temperature at which it was formed or at which it was brought to equilibrium.
      \n \nThe data obtained enable the determination of the average distribution
      of tempera ture through the brick in service, which, combined with existing
      data on thermal conductivity of silica brick, permits an estimation of the mean
      thermal conductivity of that part of the brick into which iron oxide has penetrated.
      This conductivity is greater than that of the rest of the brick and has a negative
      temperature coefficient in contrast to the positive coefficient for the unaltered
      part.", "venue": "", "year": 1936, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1,

      one, and made all approach fills necessary to complete the structure in from
      two to five days time, the time depending on the size of the structure. I-beams
      were used for stringers on all structures having a span of fourteen feet or

      soon were constructed with not less than eighteen feet of roadway. These structures
      have proved very satisfactory and the construction of similar ones will be continued

      disease: hence I report the fol\u00ad lowing case. The patient is a seaman,
      forty years old. Familial anamnesis, no remarks. In 1921 he contracted lues,
      for which he was treated for six weeks in a hospital in Hamburg, seemingly,
      according to several afterexaminations, with good result. He has lived for four
      years in South America, and while there repeatedly had malaria, the last time
      in 1930. In that year he also had dysentery. For some months past he has been
      an inmate of an asylum for inebriates, from which he was admitted to the medical
      department of the Diacons'' Home with a transfer diagnosis of lumbago. The part
      of the anamnesis which refers to his bone disease was brought out only in answer
      to direct questioning after roentgenography had revealed the condition. This
      shows how little it had troubled him. For the last ten years he has had the
      feeling that his right leg was becoming shorter than its fellow, because it
      did not reach the ground when he stood upright. For seven to ten years it has
      felt heavier than the left, from the hip downward, and has caused him a feeling
      of tiredness, which would become painful on any severe effort. This pain caused
      him to notice a thickening above the ankle. Otherwise the anamnesis contains
      nothing of interest. His natural functions are in good order. Examination on
      entry, 23rd Oct., 1934. \u2014 The patient is stoutish, his face somewhat bloodshot.
      He admits that he has been drinking a good deal, but denies being an alcoholist.
      The usual physical examina\u00ad tion showed normal conditions. Urine, normal.
      Blood pressure, 130/75. Pulse, 68. During his stay in the hospital the variations
      in his tempera\u00ad ture were rather considerable: morning, 36.3\u00b0\u201436.5\u00b0;
